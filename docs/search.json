Continuous measures are pooled as mean differences or standardized mean differences when studies use differing scales. When practicably, standardized mean differences will be re-expressed on the most meaningful scale.16 R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) will be used for analyses and data made publicly available when the guideline is completed.\n\n\n\nThe strength (certainty) of evidence for important outcomes will be appraised using either GRADE17 and ACCF/AHA18 frameworks.\n\n\n\nTBD\nTable.
