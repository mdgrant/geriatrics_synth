However, note that for hospital and 30-day mortality the GRADE was higher for nonrandomized studies.  •  Updated table of evaluation and intervention components to include discussion of expectations and palliative care discussion, as well as haloperidol for delirium prophylaxis. Replaced changed for clarity.  •  Added table of intervention frequency.  •  Physical function pooled removed period subgroups; arranged by time in forest plots and added figures showing limited change over time for RCTs and nonrandomized studies.  •  Consistent with other TIVA versus inhaled anesthesia, adverse event results were combined (naïvely) from randomized and nonrandomized designs when the GRADE from randomized clinical trials would have been low or very low.  •  Deleted pooled pulmonary complications owing to inconsistent outcome definitions.  •  Reorganized discharge location pooled results to show randomized and nonrandomized designs.  •  Added funnel plots, forest plots of risk differences, and baseline risk vs. risk ratio.  •  Added sensitivity analysis for pooled odds ratio to forest plot footnote from nonrandomized studies to include the adjusted result from Tarazona-Santabalbina 2019 (little difference from unadjusted).\n\n\n\n Outcomes reported in additional publications (not unique studies). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      Outcome\n      \n        Studies Reporting\n      \n    \n    \n      Before-After\n      Retrospective Cohort\n    \n  \n  \n    Delirium\n1\n1\n    Complications\n3\n1\n    Length of stay\n2\n1\n    Discharge location\n\n1\n    Readmission\n1\n1\n    Mortality\n2\n1\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview of changes to primary outcomes following search update.\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      Outcome\n      RCT\n      NRSI\n      GRADE\n      Effect\n      Est (CI)\n      New RCT\n      New NRSI\n      Old Est (CI)\n      GRADE Δ\n    \n  \n  \n    Delirium incidence\n6\n\nLow\nRR\n0.77 (0.60–0.99)\n\n\n\nYesa\n    \n\n6\nVery low\nRR\n0.64 (0.47–0.86)\n\n2\n0.65 (0.49–0.87)\nNo\n       Hip fracture\n4\n\n\nRR\n0.84 (0.70–0.99)\n\n\n\n\n       Other\n2\n\n\nRR\n0.54 (0.33–0.89)\n\n\n\n\n    Delayed neurocognitive recovery\n\n1\nVery low\nRR\n0.71 (0.36-1.39)\n\n\n\n\n    Postoperative neurocognitive disorder\nnone\nnone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Physical function\n5\n\nVery low\nSMD\n0.09 (-0.16 to 0.31)\n2\n\n-0.00 (-0.17 to 0.16)\nNo\n    \n\n4\nVery low\nSMD\n0.02 (-0.33 to 0.37)\n\n2\n-0.05 (-0.41 to 0.30)\nNo\n    Complications†\n4\n9\nVery low\n\nSee Below\n\n\n\n\n    Patient satisfaction\n\n1\nVery low\nRD/100\n3.3 (-5.3 to 12.0)\n\n\n\n\n    Length of stay (days)\n8\n\nVery low\nMD\n0.0 (-1.7 to 1.7)\n2\n\n0.1 (-1.9 to 2.0)\n\n    \n\n14\nVery low\nMD\n-1.1 (-2.0 to -0.1)\n\n3\n-0.9 (-2.1 to 0.3)\nNo\n    Discharge to institution\n4\n\nLow\nRR\n0.98 (0.76-1.27)\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n6\nLow\nRR\n0.82 (0.63–1.07)\n\n1\n0.65 (0.43–0.96)\nNo\n    Mortality (in-hospital or 30-day)\n4\n\nVery low\nRR\n1.02 (0.30–3.53)\n\n\n1.02 (0.12–8.46)b\n\n    \n5\n\n\nRD/1000\n0.2 (-31.6 to 32.0)\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n15\nLow\nRR\n0.66 (0.51–0.85)\n\n2\n0.67 (0.49–0.91)\nNo\n    \n\n16\n\nRD/1000\n-7.5 (-14.1 to -0.8)\n\n3\n\n\n    Mortality (1-year)\n2\n\nVery low\nRR\n0.78 (0.54–1.10)\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\nRD/1000\n-57.2 (-134.7 to 20.3)\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n5\nVery low\nRR\n0.77 (0.39–1.52)\n\n\n0.77 (0.30–1.64)c\n\n    \n\n\n\nRD/1000\n-31.5 (-113.1 to 50.1)\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    \n       RCT: randomized controlled trial; NRSI: non-randomized study of intervention; GRADE: Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation; Est: effect estimate; CI: confidence interval; RR: risk ratio; MD: mean difference; RD: risk difference.\n    \n    \n      a Although the number of studies limits the ability to assess small study effects, reviewing funnel plot suggests that possibility.

However, note that for hospital and 30-day mortality the GRADE was higher for nonrandomized studies.  •  Updated table of evaluation and intervention components to include discussion of expectations and palliative care discussion, as well as haloperidol for delirium prophylaxis. Replaced changed for clarity.  •  Added table of intervention frequency.  •  Physical function pooled removed period subgroups; arranged by time in forest plots and added figures showing limited change over time for RCTs and nonrandomized studies.  •  Consistent with other TIVA versus inhaled anesthesia, adverse event results were combined (naïvely) from randomized and nonrandomized designs when the GRADE from randomized clinical trials would have been low or very low.  •  Deleted pooled pulmonary complications owing to inconsistent outcome definitions.  •  Reorganized discharge location pooled results to show randomized and nonrandomized designs.  •  Added funnel plots, forest plots of risk differences, and baseline risk vs. risk ratio.  •  Added sensitivity analysis for pooled odds ratio to forest plot footnote from nonrandomized studies to include the adjusted result from Tarazona-Santabalbina 2019 (little difference from unadjusted).\n\n\n\n Outcomes reported in additional publications (not unique studies). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      Outcome\n      \n        Studies Reporting\n      \n    \n    \n      Before-After\n      Retrospective Cohort\n    \n  \n  \n    Delirium\n1\n1\n    Complications\n3\n1\n    Length of stay\n2\n1\n    Discharge location\n\n1\n    Readmission\n1\n1\n    Mortality\n2\n1\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview of changes to primary outcomes following search update.\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      Outcome\n      RCT\n      NRSI\n      GRADE\n      Effect\n      Est (CI)\n      New RCT\n      New NRSI\n      Old Est (CI)\n      GRADE Δ\n    \n  \n  \n    Delirium incidence\n6\n\nLow\nRR\n0.77 (0.60–0.99)\n\n\n\nYesa\n    \n\n6\nVery low\nRR\n0.64 (0.47–0.86)\n\n2\n0.65 (0.49–0.87)\nNo\n       Hip fracture\n4\n\n\nRR\n0.84 (0.70–0.99)\n\n\n\n\n       Other\n2\n\n\nRR\n0.54 (0.33–0.89)\n\n\n\n\n    Delayed neurocognitive recovery\n\n1\nVery low\nRR\n0.71 (0.36-1.39)\n\n\n\n\n    Postoperative neurocognitive disorder\nnone\nnone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Physical function\n5\n\nVery low\nSMD\n0.09 (-0.16 to 0.31)\n2\n\n-0.00 (-0.17 to 0.16)\nNo\n    \n\n4\nVery low\nSMD\n0.02 (-0.33 to 0.37)\n\n2\n-0.05 (-0.41 to 0.30)\nNo\n    Complications†\n4\n9\nVery low\n\nSee Below\n\n\n\n\n    Patient satisfaction\n\n1\nVery low\nRD/100\n3.3 (-5.3 to 12.0)\n\n\n\n\n    Length of stay (days)\n8\n\nVery low\nMD\n0.0 (-1.7 to 1.7)\n2\n\n0.1 (-1.9 to 2.0)\n\n    \n\n14\nVery low\nMD\n-1.1 (-2.0 to -0.1)\n\n3\n-0.9 (-2.1 to 0.3)\nNo\n    Discharge to institution\n4\n\nLow\nRR\n0.98 (0.76-1.27)\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n6\nLow\nRR\n0.82 (0.63–1.07)\n\n1\n0.65 (0.43–0.96)\nNo\n    Mortality (in-hospital or 30-day)\n4\n\nVery low\nRR\n1.02 (0.30–3.53)\n\n\n1.02 (0.12–8.46)b\n\n    \n5\n\n\nRD/1000\n0.2 (-31.6 to 32.0)\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n15\nLow\nRR\n0.66 (0.51–0.85)\n\n2\n0.67 (0.49–0.91)\nNo\n    \n\n16\n\nRD/1000\n-7.5 (-14.1 to -0.8)\n\n3\n\n\n    Mortality (1-year)\n2\n\nVery low\nRR\n0.78 (0.54–1.10)\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\nRD/1000\n-57.2 (-134.7 to 20.3)\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n5\nVery low\nRR\n0.77 (0.39–1.52)\n\n\n0.77 (0.30–1.64)c\n\n    \n\n\n\nRD/1000\n-31.5 (-113.1 to 50.1)\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    \n       RCT: randomized controlled trial; NRSI: non-randomized study of intervention; GRADE: Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation; Est: effect estimate; CI: confidence interval; RR: risk ratio; MD: mean difference; RD: risk difference.\n    \n    \n      a Although the number of studies limits the ability to assess small study effects, reviewing funnel plot suggests that possibility.
