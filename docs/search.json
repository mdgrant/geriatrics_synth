However, note that for hospital and 30-day mortality the GRADE was higher for nonrandomized studies.  •  Updated table of evaluation and intervention components to include discussion of expectations and palliative care discussion, as well as haloperidol for delirium prophylaxis. Replaced changed for clarity.  •  Added table of intervention frequency.  •  Physical function pooled removed period subgroups; arranged by time in forest plots and added figures showing limited change over time for RCTs and nonrandomized studies.  •  Consistent with other TIVA versus inhaled anesthesia, adverse event results were combined (naïvely) from randomized and nonrandomized designs when the GRADE from randomized clinical trials would have been low or very low.  •  Deleted pooled pulmonary complications owing to inconsistent outcome definitions.  •  Reorganized discharge location pooled results to show randomized and nonrandomized designs.  •  Added funnel plots, forest plots of risk differences, and baseline risk vs. risk ratio.  •  Added sensitivity analysis for pooled odds ratio to forest plot footnote from nonrandomized studies to include the adjusted result from Tarazona-Santabalbina 2019 (little difference from unadjusted).\n\n\n\n Outcomes reported in additional publications (not necessarily unique studies). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      Outcome\n      \n        Studies Reporting\n      \n    \n    \n      Before-After\n      Retrospective Cohort\n    \n  \n  \n    Delirium\n1\n1\n    Complications\n3\n1\n    Length of stay\n2\n1\n    Discharge location\n\n1\n    Readmission\n1\n1\n    Mortality\n2\n1\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview of changes to primary outcomes following search update.\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      Outcome\n      RCT\n      NRSI\n      GRADE\n      Effect\n      Est (CI)\n      New RCT\n      New NRSI\n      Old Est (CI)\n      GRADE Δ\n    \n  \n  \n    Delirium incidence\n6\n\nLow\nRR\n0.77 (0.60–0.99)\n\n\n\nYesa\n    \n\n6\nVery low\nRR\n0.64 (0.47–0.86)\n\n2\n0.65 (0.49–0.87)\nNo\n       Hip fracture\n4\n\n\nRR\n0.84 (0.70–0.99)\n\n\n\n\n       Other\n2\n\n\nRR\n0.54 (0.33–0.89)\n\n\n\n\n    Neurocognitive disorder &lt;30 days\n\n1\nVery low\nRR\n0.71 (0.36-1.39)\n\n\n\n\n    Neurocognitive disorder ≥30 days\nnone\nnone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Physical function\n5\n\nVery low\nSMD\n0.09 (-0.16 to 0.31)\n2\n\n-0.00 (-0.17 to 0.16)\nNo\n    \n\n4\nVery low\nSMD\n0.02 (-0.33 to 0.37)\n\n2\n-0.05 (-0.41 to 0.30)\nNo\n    Complications†\n4\n9\nVery low\n\nsee Below\n\n\n\n\n    Patient satisfaction\n\n1\nVery low\nRD/100\n3.3 (-5.3 to 12.0)\n\n\n\n\n    Length of stay (days)\n8\n\nVery low\nMD\n0.0 (-1.7 to 1.7)\n2\n\n0.1 (-1.9 to 2.0)\n\n    \n\n14\nVery low\nMD\n-1.1 (-2.0 to -0.1)\n\n3\n-0.9 (-2.1 to 0.3)\nNo\n    Discharge to institution\n4\n\nLow\nRR\n0.98 (0.76-1.27)\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n6\nLow\nRR\n0.82 (0.63–1.07)\n\n1\n0.65 (0.43–0.96)\nNo\n    Mortality (in-hospital or 30-day)\n4\n\nVery low\nRR\n1.02 (0.30–3.53)\n\n\n1.02 (0.12–8.46)b\n\n    \n5\n\n\nRD/1000\n0.2 (-31.6 to 32.0)\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n15\nLow\nRR\n0.66 (0.51–0.85)\n\n2\n0.67 (0.49–0.91)\nNo\n    \n\n16\n\nRD/1000\n-7.5 (-14.1 to -0.8)\n\n3\n\n\n    Mortality (1-year)\n2\n\nVery low\nRR\n0.78 (0.54–1.10)\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\nRD/1000\n-57.2 (-134.7 to 20.3)\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n5\nVery low\nRR\n0.77 (0.39–1.52)\n\n\n0.77 (0.30–1.64)c\n\n    \n\n\n\nRD/1000\n-31.5 (-113.1 to 50.1)\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    \n       RCT: randomized controlled trial; NRSI: non-randomized study of intervention; GRADE: Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation; Est: effect estimate; CI: confidence interval; RR: risk ratio; MD: mean difference; RD: risk difference.\n    \n    \n      a Although the number of studies limits the ability to assess small study effects, reviewing funnel plot suggests that possibility.

The incidence of delirium was comparable between the dexmedetomidine and control groups in the first 3 postoperative days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeiner\n2017\n\n\n429\n\nInclude: &gt;68; major elective noncardiac surgery.\nExclude: MMSE &lt;20; dementia; emergency surgery; intracardiac or intracranial surgery; planned postop intubation; severe visual or auditory handicap; illiteracy; parkinsons disease; life expectancy &lt;6months; renal failure requiring dialysis; sick sinus syndrome; second or third-degree heart block or clinically significant sinus bradycardia; contraindication for use of an a2-adrenic agonist; ASA class IV or V; hepatic dysfunction.\n\n\nNo difference in postop delirium delirium between the dexmedetomidine and placebo groups. After adjusting for age and education, there was no difference in postop cognitive performance between treatment groups at 3 and 6 months. Adverse events were comparably distributed between the two groups.\n\n\nThe study was stopped for futility in accord with the DSMB in January 2014 based on a planned interim analysis in the spring of 2013. The conditional power for concluding efficacy under the original assumption of treatment effect was 3% and under the observed trend and a null trend was less than 1% for both.

The aim was to assess the effectiveness of 1.5 mg of haloperidol daily versus placebo on the primary (incident delirium) and secondary (deterioration of delirium) prevention of postoperative delirium in hip-surgery patients.”\n\n\n\n\nPrakanrattana 2007\n\n126\n\nAntipsychotics\n\n\n“This study was primarily aimed to evaluate the potential of a single dose of risperidone to prevent postoperative delirium in adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.”\n\n\n\n\nLarsen 2010\n\n495\n\nAntipsychotics\n\n\n“Our study sought to evaluate the impact of the perioperative administration of olanzapine on the prevention of postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing elective joint-replacement surgery.
