    "text": "Between 2019 and 2060, the number of US adults aged 65 years or older will likely increase from 54 to 95 million; the oldest-old (85+ years) will grow from 6.6 to 19 million over the same period.1,2 These demographic shifts carry significant implications for the practice of anesthesiology.

Continuous measures are pooled as mean differences or standardized mean differences when studies use differing scales. When practicably, standardized mean differences will be re-expressed on the most meaningful scale.16 R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) will be used for analyses and data made publicly available when the guideline is completed.\n\n\n\nThe strength (certainty) of evidence for important outcomes will be appraised using either GRADE17 and ACCF/AHA18 frameworks.\n\n\n\nTBD\nTable.

    "text": "Between 2019 and 2060, the number of US adults aged 65 years or older will likely increase from 54 to 95 million; the oldest-old (85+ years) will grow from 6.6 to 19 million over the same period.1,2 These demographic shifts carry significant implications for the practice of anesthesiology. In 2007, the elderly (15% of the US population) underwent 35% of inpatient surgeries.3 In 2006, 32% of outpatient surgeries were performed in the elderly.4 Moreover, the risk of postoperative complications increases with age.5,6 Improving the quality of perioperative care for older adults is a major priority for patients, providers, and policy makers."

Continuous measures are pooled as mean differences or standardized mean differences when studies use differing scales.
