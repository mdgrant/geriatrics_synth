As required, figures will be digitized. A single reviewer will extract study data followed by verification.8\n\n\n\nRisk of bias assessment for randomized trials will be conducted using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. 9 Risk of bias assessment of non-randomized studies of interventions (e.g., observational studies of interventions including cohort, case-control, and quasi-randomized designs) will utilize the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies of Interventions tool (ROBINS-I).10 Risk of bias will be assessed independently by two reviewers with discrepancies resolved by discussion, or a third reviewer as needed.\n\n\n\nAs appropriate, based on clinical and methodological heterogeneity, study results will be pooled in either pairwise or network meta-analyses in random effects models (given the goal of estimating unconditional effects not relevant only to the pooled studies).11 Statistical heterogeneity is evaluated using between study variance and I2.12 When there is meaningful heterogeneity and the number of studies sufficient (e.g., 10 or more) meta-regression is considered to explain the variability.13 With 10 or more pooled studies, small study effects and the potential for publication bias will be examined in funnel plots, regression-based tests, adjustment methods, and p-curves.14,15\nRelative effects will be pooled as risk ratios for clinical interpretability except when adjusted measures reported as odds are pooled. Continuous measures are pooled as mean differences or standardized mean differences when studies use differing scales. When practicably, standardized mean differences will be re-expressed on the most meaningful scale.16 R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) will be used for analyses and data made publicly available when the guideline is completed.\n\n\n\nThe strength (certainty) of evidence for important outcomes will be appraised using either GRADE17 and ACCF/AHA18 frameworks.\n\n\n\nTBD\nTable.
