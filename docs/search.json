Continuous measures are pooled as mean differences or standardized mean differences when studies use differing scales. When practicably, standardized mean differences will be re-expressed on the most meaningful scale.16 R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) will be used for analyses and data made publicly available when the guideline is completed.\n\n\n\nThe strength (certainty) of evidence for important outcomes will be appraised using either GRADE17 and ACCF/AHA18 frameworks.\n\n\n\nTBD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nSection\nModification\n\n\n\n\nJuly 2021\nNone\nFirst draft\n\n\nJune 2022\nKey questions\nKey questions removed: EEG monitoring and cognitive function; sedation titration with EEG monitoring; and maintaining intraoperative high blood pressure\n\n\nFebruary 2023\nKey questions\nKQ8 combined with KQ1; KQ2 (prehabilitation) and KQ7 (pain) removed\n\n\nSeptember 2023\nKey questions\nReworded to “older patients”\n\n\n\nPICOTS\nUpdated to be consistent with deleted and combined key questions\n\n\n\nAnalytic framework\nUpdated to be consistent with deleted and combined key questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

(Studies including younger patients will be considered if a result is judged transportable to the target population).\nPublication Types\n\nPublished journal articles, reports \nLanguage restrictions: English language only\nLimited to humans\nGrey literature\n\nStudy Designs\n\nInclude\n\nRandomized clinical trials\nNon-randomized trials\nQuasi-randomized designs (eg, before-after studies, interrupted time series)\nCohort studies (prospective, retrospective)\nCase-control studies\nOther observational studies (eg, diagnostic accuracy)\n\nExclude\n\nCase reports and case series\nSurveys, questionnaires\nLetters\nEditorials\nConference abstracts\nSystematic reviews and meta-analyses (for reference checking)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Separate document)\n\n\n\nTitle/abstract and full-text screening together with data extraction will be performed on the DistillerSR platform.7 All screening will be conducted in duplicate, with disagreements resolved by consensus or a third reviewer as needed.\nAnticipated data extraction includes study characteristics (eg, design, dates, setting, centers, country, funding, registration, subgroups, surgery, and anesthetic), study arms (eg, intervention, participant characteristics, intervention, and outcomes reported), and outcome detail according to type (eg, patient-reported or clinical; continuous, dichotomous [includes relative effects], rating scales [Likert, visual analog, numeric]). As required, figures will be digitized. A single reviewer will extract study data followed by verification.8\n\n\n\nRisk of bias assessment for randomized trials will be conducted using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. 9 Risk of bias assessment of non-randomized studies of interventions (eg, observational studies of interventions including cohort, case-control, and quasi-randomized designs) will utilize the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies of Interventions tool (ROBINS-I).10 Risk of bias will be assessed independently by two reviewers with discrepancies resolved by discussion, or a third reviewer as needed.\n\n\n\nAs appropriate, based on clinical and methodological heterogeneity, study results will be pooled in either pairwise or network meta-analyses in random effects models (given the goal of estimating unconditional effects not relevant only to the pooled studies).11 Statistical heterogeneity is evaluated using between study variance and I2.12 When there is meaningful heterogeneity and the number of studies sufficient (eg, 10 or more) meta-regression is considered to explain the variability.13 With 10 or more pooled studies, small study effects and the potential for publication bias will be examined in funnel plots, regression-based tests, adjustment methods, and p-curves.14,15\nRelative effects will be pooled as risk ratios for clinical interpretability except when adjusted measures reported as odds are pooled. Continuous measures are pooled as mean differences or standardized mean differences when studies use differing scales. When practicably, standardized mean differences will be re-expressed on the most meaningful scale.16 R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) will be used for analyses and data made publicly available when the guideline is completed.\n\n\n\nThe strength (certainty) of evidence for important outcomes will be appraised using either GRADE17 and ACCF/AHA18 frameworks.\n\n\n\nTBD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nSection\nModification\n\n\n\n\nJuly 2021\nNone\nFirst draft\n\n\nJune 2022\nKey questions\nKey questions removed: EEG monitoring and cognitive function; sedation titration with EEG monitoring; and maintaining intraoperative high blood pressure\n\n\nFebruary 2023\nKey questions\nKQ8 combined with KQ1; KQ2 (prehabilitation) and KQ7 (pain) removed\n\n\nSeptember 2023\nKey questions\nReworded to “older patients”\n\n\n\nPICOTS\nUpdated to be consistent with deleted and combined key questions\n\n\n\nAnalytic framework\nUpdated to be consistent with deleted and combined key questions"

Additionally the pooled effect appeared strong (RR 0.57, OR 0.50). Finally, the results would be convincing even to a skeptic if a RR &lt;0.95 is considered plausible (see Matthews 2019).3 Funnel plot asymmetry consistent with small study effects and potential for publication bias (not evident in network result).4 Some concerns both trials.5 Few events.6 Different instruments used.7 Single study, cannot assess consistency.8 Wide confidence interval.9 Although bradycardia threshold varied among studies, it did not appear to impact the results.10 Although wide prediction interval for pooled RR (0.65–2.91), only 4 studies found RR point estimates less than 1.11 There was heterogeneity in the definition of hypotension. However, hypotension was likely under-reported, as some studies treated hypotension and did not report the events.12 Wide confidence interval for pooled estimate compatible with benefit or harm, 1 study reported no events and 1 study a single event.13 Confidence interval crosses the null.14 Wide confidence interval for pooled estimate compatible with benefit or harm, one study reported no events.15 Variability in ranges of plausible RRs.16 Wide confidence interval for pooled estimate compatible with benefit or harm,one study reported low number of events.17 Wide confidence interval for pooled estimate compatible with benefit or harm, both studies reported few events.18 Wide confidence interval compatible with benefit or harm, one event reported.19 Wide confidence interval compatible with benefit or harm, two events reported.20 Three studies judged at low risk of bias, 1 moderate, 1 high.21 Wide confidence interval compatible with benefit or harm.22 Prediction interval for pooled MD (-3.3 to -0.2) (I 2 = 95%).23 Heterogeneity in types of procedure and country.24 Few events with widely variable effect estimates."

    "text": "Common effects model for baseline event rate\n\nPrediction intervals if 5 or more studies\n\nRisk differences were pooled using events per 1,000 patients except when events were more frequent (eg, hypotension and bradycardia following dexmedetomidine)\nFor adverse events, both non-randomized and randomized studies were pooled naively, as a rationale for including non-randomized studies was to assess adverse events.,\n\nWe pooled study results in pairwise or network meta-analyses based on the key question, clinical and methodological diversity. Random effects models were fitted given the goal of estimating unconditional effects{Hedges, 1998 #147} (i.e., effects not relevant only to the pooled studies), but results from common effects models were also reported (for two studies, only common effects). For dichotomous outcomes reported in randomized clinical trials, default models used the Mantel-Haenszel method{Van Houwelingen, 1993 #84;Higgins, 2020 #183} and the restricted maximum likelihood estimator{Viechtbauer, 2016 #137} for between-study variance. For nonrandomized designs reporting adjusted results for the outcome of interest (e.g., odds ratios), effect measures were combined, and pooled risk differences were approximated using the pooled comparator arm event rate from a common effects model, converting odds ratios to risk ratios{Ben-Shachar, 2020 #362}. The pooled comparator (general anesthesia) event rate accompanying risk differences was derived from common effects models. When five or more studies were pooled, we applied the Hartung-Knapp adjustment{Cornell, 2014 #136} to the estimate and corresponding prediction interval.{Partlett, 2017 #363} Details concerning methods used for meta-analyses of the most relevant outcomes accompany forest plots in the supplemental materials. Network meta-analyses were conducted using frequentist methods.{Rücker, 2022 #174} Consistency was examined by comparing direct to indirect evidence.{Rücker, 2022 #174} We assessed statistical heterogeneity based on the between-study variance and prediction intervals.{Borenstein, 2023 #360} When few studies were pooled (e.g., less than 5) or events infrequent, prediction intervals were considered potentially unreliable and not reported. As appropriate for the number of included studies (e.g., 10 or more to apply statistical tests or adjustment), small study effects and the potential for publication bias were examined using funnel plots tests (comparison-adjusted for network meta-analyses), regression-based tests,{Egger, 1997 #73;Pustejovsky, 2019 #359} and limit meta-analyses{Rücker, 2022 #174}. The sensitivity of results to outliers, subgroup differences, use of alternative between-study variance estimators, and impact of the Hartung-Knapp adjustment were examined as relevant. We examined dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios for clinical interpretability{Xiao, 2022 #177} with odds ratios used to examine small study effects. As relevant to inform recommendations (particularly for infrequent adverse events), risk differences were also reported with attention to variability in baseline risks. Continuous outcomes were evaluated as mean differences or standardized mean differences when studies used differing scales. When practicable, standardized mean differences were re-expressed on the most common scale.{Higgins, 2020 #183} For continuous outcomes, when means and variances were unavailable, and authors reported medians, interquartile and overall ranges for the effects of interest, they were imputed.{Luo, 2018 #178;Shi, 2020 #179;Wan, 2014 #180;Cai, 2021 #181;White, 2005 #182} If necessary, p-values were used to estimate a missing variance.{Fu, 2013 #184}\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.
