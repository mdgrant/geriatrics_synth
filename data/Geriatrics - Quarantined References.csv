We investigated whether the relationship between predicted effect-site propofol concentration and both bispectral index (BIS) and SE values is useful for predicting loss of verbal contact and loss of consciousness during steady-state conditions. METHODS: Twenty unpremedicated patients undergoing elective major abdominal surgery were recruited. A target-controlled infusion of propofol was administered using Schneider's pharmacokinetic model. The propofol infusion was set at an initial site-effect concentration of 1.0 microg ml(-1), and increased by 1.0 microg ml(-1) steps every 4 min, up to 6.0 microg ml(-1). A 4-min interval was chosen to ensure that steady-state site-effect concentrations were obtained. Propofol site-effect concentrations and BIS and SE values were recorded at loss of verbal contact (LVC) and loss of consciousness (LOC). Population values for predicted effect-site concentrations at the clinical endpoints were estimated and correlated with BIS and SE values. RESULTS: For LVC, the effect-site concentration for 90% of patients was 1.1 (1.1-3.2) microg ml(-1) and for LOC 2.8 (2.8-5.65) microg ml(-1). LVC occurred in 90% of patients at a BIS value of 70.2 (70.2-90.2) and an SE value of 60.3 (60.3-75.5) and LOC occurred at a BIS value of 38.2 (38.2-70.4) and an SE value of 42.2 (42.2-60.4). CONCLUSIONS: LVC and LOC occurred within a defined range of predicted effect-site concentrations. SE had a smaller range than BIS and higher correlation with effect-site concentration and may be more useful than BIS in predicting both LVC and LOC.",duplicate of 1781,,,

This Recommendations Statement: 1. summarizes a review of the literature on existing cognitive screening tools used within preoperative settings; 2. discusses factors to consider when selecting cognitive screening tools in a preoperative environment; and 3. includes a work flow diagram to guide use of these screening measures. Methodology involved searching peer-reviewed literature for 29 cognitive screening tools which were identified from the literature that fit inclusion criteria. Of these 29, seven tests have been used in preoperative settings and are discussed. These seven had an average administration time ranging from one to ten minutes. Memory, language, and attention were the most commonly evaluated cognitive domains. Most had adequate sensitivity and specificity to detect cognitive impairment/dementia. While information on the psychometric properties of these tools is limited, the tools discussed are appropriate for lay examiners, are short in duration, and accessible for free or at a low cost. We describe factors that must be considered prior to instrument selection.",duplicate of 3933,,,

METHODS: Eighty elderly patients (> 64-years-old) following elective general anaesthesia for radical cancer surgeries were randomly allocated into two groups (n = 40 each): the dexmedetomidine group (Group D) and the normal saline group (Group C). Anaesthesia was maintained with continuous intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine at - 0.2 microg kg(-1) h(-1) in Group D, and an equal volume of normal saline (0.5 ml kg(-1) h(-1)) was given in Group C. All patients were observed for 30 min in the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU), AFPS and NRS were recorded every 2 min, and the total doses of nalbuphine and fentanyl were calculated in the PACU. MAP and HR were recorded at the time of 10 min (T1), 20 min (T2), 30 min (T3) after dexmedetomidine or saline pumping, and before extubation (T4), immediately after extubation (T5), and 5 min after extubation (T6). We also documented some durations, including anaesthesia duration (D1), surgery duration (D2), duration from the end of surgery to extubation (D3), and emergence agitation duration (D4). RESULTS: The MAP in Group C was significantly higher than that in Group D (P < 0.05), and there were no significant changes between the two groups in HR and MAP within each time point and D1, D2, D3, and D4. The incidence of agitation, NRS score and total dose of nalbuphine and fentanyl were all lower in Group D than in Group C (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: An intraoperative low-dose dexmedetomidine continuous infusion can reduce emergence agitation following general anaesthesia in elderly patients (> 64-years-old), remain stable in terms of haemodynamics, and not lead to delays in anaesthesia recovery time and extubation time.",only outcome reported is emergence agitation,,"Level 1, Title abstract screening; Level 2, Full text screening ; Level 3, Outcomes - Dichotomous; Level 3, Outcomes - Likert; Level 3, Study Arm; Level 3, Study Characteristics; Level 4, Automated RoB 2 (Cochrane) - Parallel",Sun2022AgingClinExpRes.pdf

A., Jr.",Prospective comparison of sinonasal outcomes after microscopic sublabial or endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery for nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas,"OBJECT Both endoscopic and microscopic transsphenoidal approaches are accepted techniques for the resection of pituitary adenomas. Although studies have explored patient outcomes for each technique individually, none have prospectively compared sinonasal and quality of life outcomes in a concurrent series of patients at the same institution, as has been done in the present study. METHODS Patients with nonfunctioning adenomas undergoing transsphenoidal surgery were assessed for sinonasal function, quality of life, and pain using the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-20 (SNOT-20), the short form of the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) instrument, the SF-36, and a headache scale. Eighty-two patients undergoing either endoscopic (47 patients) or microscopic (35 patients) surgery were surveyed preoperatively and at 24-48 hours, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 1 year after surgery. RESULTS Patients who underwent endoscopic and microscopic transsphenoidal surgery experienced a similar recovery pattern, showing an initial increase in symptoms during the first 2 weeks, followed by a return to baseline by 4 weeks and improvement beyond baseline functioning by 8 weeks. Patients who underwent endoscopic surgery experienced better sinonasal outcomes at 24-48 hours (SNOT total p = 0.015, SNOT rhinologic subscale [ssRhino] p < 0.001), 2 weeks (NOSE p = 0.013), and 8 weeks (SNOT total p = 0.032 and SNOT ssRhino p = 0.035). By 1 year after surgery, no significant differences in sinonasal outcomes were observed between the 2 groups. Headache scales at 1 year improved in all dimensions except duration for both groups (total result 73%, p = 0.004; severity 46%, p < 0.001; frequency 53%, p < 0.001), with 80% of either microscopic or endoscopic patients experiencing improvement or resolution of headache symptoms. Endoscopic and microscopic patients experienced reduced vitality preoperatively compared with US population norms and remained low postoperatively. By 8 weeks after surgery, both groups experienced significant improvements in mental health (13%, p = 0.005) and vitality (15%, p = 0.037). By 1 year after surgery, patients improved significantly in mental health (14%, p = 0.03), role physical (14%, p = 0.036), social functioning (16%, p = 0.009), vitality (22%, p = 0.002), and SF-36 total (10%, p = 0.024) as compared with preoperative measures. There were no significant differences at any time point between the 2 groups for the total SF-36 or for any of the 8 subscales. CONCLUSIONS Patients who underwent either an endoscopic or a microscopic approach experienced the greatest nasal symptoms at 2 weeks postoperatively and exhibited similar time courses of recovery in nasal, headache, and quality of life assessments. Although patients who underwent endoscopic surgery experienced significantly fewer nasal symptoms during the first 8 weeks, by 1 year after surgery, there were no significant differences between the 2 groups.",Duplicate of 14006,,"Level 1, Title abstract screening",

This study investigated the effects of dexmedetomidine on POD and pro-inflammatory markers in elderly patients with hip fracture. Methods: This randomized, double-blind, controlled trial enrolled patients ≥65 years of age who underwent an operation for hip fracture at Beijing JiShuiTan Hospital from October 2016 to January 2017. The patients were divided into the DEX group (injected with dexmedetomidine 0.5 µg/kg/h) and the NS group (injected with normal saline). After surgery, the incidence of delirium at postoperative day 1 (T1), 2 (T2), and 3 (T3) was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method delirium scale. Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α blood levels were detected at T0 (before surgery), T1, and T3. Results: Data from 240 patients were analyzed, with 120/group (intent-to-treat analysis). Dexmedetomidine decreased POD incidence (18.2 vs. 30.6%, P = 0.033). Compared to T0, all three pro-inflammatory markers were higher at T1 and then decreased at T3 (time interaction, all P < 0.001). IL-6 (P < 0.001) levels were lower in the DEX group at T1, and TNF-α (P = 0.003) levels were lower in the DEX group at T1 and T3, but IL-1β levels were similar between the two groups. The rate of adverse events was similar in the two groups.

A large amount of evidence has been reported on comparing outcomes of neuraxial(spinal or epidural) anesthesia and general anesthesia. However, it is unclear whether nerve blocks(NB) as main anesthesia technique compared with general anesthesia(GA) for THA could reduce perioperative complications. We conducted a retrospective evaluation of NB and GA, using a propensity score-matched analysis(PSMA). Methods: A total of 902 patients older than 60 years old with hip disease undergoing primary THA received combined lumbosacral plexus and T12 paravertebral nerve blocks (n = 143) or GA (n = 759) at our institution from 2012 to 2018.Binary logistic regression was used for comparison of the primary outcomes(the incidence of delirium) and the secondary outcomes(the percentage of postoperative hemoglobin(>10g/dl), transfusion(>2 units), major cardiac events(MACE), postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC) and 30-day mortality) in the matched cohorts.Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v 23.0. Results: Both cohorts were balanced in all included parameters after PSMA. The incidence of delirium was lower (OR 0.233,95% CI 0.064-0.845, p = 0.030) in NB group in matched cohorts. In the unmatched and matched cohorts, the percentage of Hb(>10g/dl) was higher in GA group but the incidence of transfusion(>2 units) was higher in NB group. No difference was found in the incidence of 30-day mortality in the unmatched and matched cohorts. In the unmatched cohorts, the incidence of PPC was higher and LOS was longer in NB cohort, but no difference was observed in the matched cohorts.

Frail older people are vulnerable to geriatric syndromes, and complications such as postoperative cognitive dysfunction and delirium are explored. This review also considers how frailty, with its decline of organ function, affects the metabolism of anesthetic agents and may influence the choice of anesthetic technique in an older person. Optimal perioperative care includes the identification of frailty, a multisystem and multidisciplinary evaluation preoperatively, and discussion of treatment goals and expectations.

The surgeon plays a key role in the appropriate selection of patients and procedures, optimisation of their functional status prior to surgery, and provision of more intensive care for those who are at high risk of post-operative complications. The literature, mainly based on retrospective, non-randomised studies, suggests that factors such as age, co-morbidities, pre-operative cognitive function and intensity of the surgical procedure all appear to contribute to the development of post-operative complications. Several studies have shown that a pre-operative geriatric assessment predicts post-operative mortality and morbidity as well as survival in older surgical cancer patients. Geriatricians are used to working in multidisciplinary teams that assess older patients and make individual treatment plans. However, the role of the geriatrician in the surgical oncology setting is not well established. A geriatrician could be a valuable contribution to the treatment team both in the pre-operative stage (patient assessment and pre-operative optimisation) and the post-operative stage (patient assessment and treatment of medical complications as well as discharge planning).",duplicate of 4956,,,

Proinflammatory processes play an important role in the pathogenesis of postoperative delirium. Therefore, dexamethasone might have a beneficial effect on the reduction of this complication. METHODS: This randomized clinical trial was conducted with the objective of the evaluation of dexamethasone effects on postoperative delirium and complications after cardiac surgery. The eligible patients were divided into 2 groups of dexamethasone with 43 patients and placebo with 50 patients. The dexamethasone group took 8mg dexamethasone before induction of anesthesia followed by 8mg every 8 hour for 3 days and the other group received placebo in the same way. RESULTS: all patients were assessed by a mini mental status questionnaire and psychiatric interviewing with the aim of diagnosing delirium. Extubation time of the dexamethasone group was significantly reduced. Our results showed that in the first postoperative day delirium, extubation time, and intensive care unit length of stay significantly decreased in the dexamethasone group without increasing serious complications such as infectious diseases. After administration of dexamethasone only hyperglycemia as an adverse event was increased in the dexamethasone group. Other complications of renal, cardiac, cerebrovascular and respiratory system did not show any significant differences between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: postoperative delirium is in correlation with costly adverse events after cardiac surgery.

Urological procedures range from minor day case to major surgery in which extensive resources are needed both intra- and postoperatively. For simple day case procedures like cystoscopy or ureteroscopy, general anaesthesia is most commonly used because it allows for early ambulation. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) needs special attention. TURP syndrome due to excessive absorption of the irrigation fluid can be catastrophic if not managed early. Avoiding contributing factors and choosing regional anaesthesia which allows for early detection are key. Careful perioperative planning and risk stratification is important in major urological cancer surgery. Most of these procedures will require general anaesthesia (due to longer operative time and more extensive surgical trauma).

Patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) have a high prevalence of coronary disease and are at risk for cardiac events. This may offset the prognostic benefit of surgical repair. We investigated whether preoperative exercise equilibrium radionuclide angiography (ERNA) could be used to identify patients at high risk for cardiac events after successful AAA repair. Methods. Between 1990 and 1995, 173 patients with an AAA were referred for supine bicycle exercise ERNA preoperatively. Follow-up information was obtained from a questionnaire sent to each patient's family physician. Cardiac events were defined as cardiac death or nonfatal myocardial infarction. Results. A total of 139 patients were able to exercise and did not die or suffer myocardial infarction perioperatively. The median follow-up period was 3.8 years. Diabetes mellitus, an exercise ejection fraction (EF) below 0.50, and a fall in EF with exercise were univariable predictors of cardiac risk during the follow-up period (P < .05). On multivariable analysis, diabetes mellitus (risk ratio [RR], 6.9; 95% CI 1.5 to 32.0) and an EF fall (RR, 4.1; 95% CI 1.5 to 11.4) emerged as the most important predictors. Conclusions. Exercise ERNA predicts long-term cardiac events in patients being considered for elective AAA repair. Such predictive information may influence the decision to operate, for example, on small unthreatening aneurysms, or lead to invasive cardiological management to minimize risk.",duplicate of 5834,,"Level 1, Title abstract screening",

This study was undertaken to analyze characteristics and outcomes of patients who had thyroid surgery performed under regional anesthesia compared with those who had thyroidectomy under general anesthesia. STUDY DESIGN: One hundred seventy-five consecutive patients who underwent thyroid surgery under regional or general anesthesia during a 3-year period were analyzed. Fifty-eight operations were performed under regional anesthesia and 116 under general anesthesia. Patient characteristics analyzed included age, gender, obesity, anesthesia class, and tumor pathology. Postoperative complications, including nausea or vomiting, were compared. Additionally, operative times and length of stay in each group were compared. RESULTS: Patient characteristics including age, gender, tumor pathology, and anesthesia class were similar in both groups. But only 2% of patients treated under regional anesthesia were obese compared with 23% under general anesthesia. Although not significant, there was a trend toward decreased incidence of nausea and vomiting in the regional group. Other complications for the regional and general anesthesia groups were equal at 3%. Two patients required conversion to general anesthesia. Complications in the general anesthesia group included one episode of transient symptomatic hypocalcemia, two patients with transient vocal cord paralysis, and one episode of hematoma. Finally, there was a statistically significant increase in total operating room time and length of stay for the general anesthesia group. CONCLUSIONS: Regional anesthesia is a safe alternative to general anesthesia for patients undergoing thyroid surgery. Patients who cannot communicate verbally with the surgical team or who are obese may not be ideal candidates for regional anesthesia. The use of regional anesthesia results in a decreased length of stay and similar operative and operating room times. © 2001 American College of Surgeons.",Duplicate of 2411,,"Level 1, Title abstract screening; Level 2, Full text screening ",Specht2001JAmerCollSurg.pdf

However, this is questionable since general anaesthesia (GA) does not preclude intraoperative microrecordings and clinical evaluation of, for example, current spread to the corticospinal tract. In addition, even in the awake state, clinical testing is not without limitations. We report on intra- and postoperative findings in 11 patients suffering from advanced PD who were operated under GA (propofol/remifentanil). The activity of STN neurons under GA was characterized by excessive burst discharges that differed fundamentally from the irregular tonic patterns observed in the STN of awake patients. In all patients, we obtained improved motor symptoms and reduced levodopa-induced dyskinesias and motor fluctuations, which was associated with a reduction in the levodopa equivalent daily dose. Therapeutic DBS was not limited by current spread to the corticospinal tract in any of the patients. The trajectories chosen for electrode implantation in GA compared well to awake surgery. Our results indicate that STN surgery in GA can be performed in a safe manner. It can be offered to anxious patients, and represents a viable option when awake surgery bears a risk for the patient. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.",duplicate of 4810,,"Level 1, Title abstract screening",

The present study investigated psychiatric comorbidity and postoperative effects of DBS of different targets on mood and psychological functions in 81 patients with a mean follow-up of 37 months. Methods: A total of 109 patients underwent implantation of DBS electrodes between 2001 and 2006; it was possible to evaluate 81 patients by a psychiatric test battery using the ""Neuropsychiatric Inventory"". To evaluate the possible influence of the target, we analyzed the data without 16 patients with DBS surgery for other diseases (e.g., epilepsia, cluster headache) or unilateral implantation only. The resulting population (n = 65, mean age 61 years, range 23-78 years, male:female 42:23) consisted of 43 Parkinson's disease patients stimulated in the subthalamic nucleus, ten dystonia patients stimulated in the globus pallidus internus, and 12 tremor patients in the ventral intermediate nucleus. Results: There was a high rate of preoperative psychiatric comorbidity, which is reflected by a high rate of patients with preoperative medication of neuroleptic drugs (18.4 %, especially clozapin 14.7 %) and antidepressive drugs (16.5 %). Depression was the most common psychiatric side-effect after DBS, occurring in 47.7 % of all patients (31/65 patients), without significant preference to a specific target (STN: 42 %, Gpi: 60 %, VIM: 58 %). Delusion (n = 5 out of 43 PD patients, 11.6 %), euphoria (n = 1, 2.3 %) and disinhibition (n = 3, 7.0 %) were seen in the PD patients only. Conclusion: A wide range of behavioural changes may be seen following DBS. Depression was the most common side-effect after DBS, and occurred independently of the target. PD patients, in contrast to dystonia and tremor patients, developed complications in all tested subgroups, with varying frequencies. Preoperative evaluation for psychiatric and cognitive dysfunction is crucial to identify patients who are at specific risk for psychiatric complications. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.",duplicate of 3263,,"Level 1, Title abstract screening",

This study aims at investigating the effect of a single pre-operative oral administration of morphine sulphate (Oramorph®) on pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). Methods. Forty-one ASA I-III patients, aged 18-65 years, undergoing LC were randomly, double-blindly allocated to treatment (N.=20, 30mg Oramorph®, group M) or placebo (N.=21, group P). General anesthesia was maintained with propofol and remifentanil. All patients received ketamine 0.2 mg/kg iv at induction, intraoperative ketorolac 30mg iv and tramadol postoperatively (iv PCA: bolus 50 mg, lock-out 30 min, max 100 mg/4 hours). Numerical rating scale for pain (NRS), White's fast track and PADSS scores, tramadol consumption and adverse events were recorded for the first 24h.

Although the assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is of increasing importance, few studies have examined this in conjunction with LDLT recipient nutritional state. METHODS: Ten LDLT recipients with end-stage liver disease were recruited for this study. Measurements of energy expenditure, anthropometrics and laboratory data were performed before and 1, 6 and 12-24 months after LDLT. HRQOL was measured by using the 36-item Short-Form (SF-36) before and 1, 3, 6 and 12-24 months after LDLT. RESULTS: The preoperative value of non-protein respiratory quotient (npRQ) was 0.796 +/- 0.026 and it increased significantly after the operation. Serum non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) levels were high in the preoperative state, but had significantly decreased 1 month after the operation. A negative correlation between npRQ and NEFA was observed throughout the study period. Cholinesterase and albumin levels improved to normal levels within 6 and 12-24 months, respectively. The recovery of the physical component summary of the SF-36 was observed after the improvement of all domains of laboratory data and energy metabolism based on the nutritional state. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the recovery of metabolic function, laboratory data and HRQOL in LDLT recipients are variable, and it took more than 6 months to normalize the liver protein synthetic capacity and physical HRQOL score periods.

Older individuals require more medical services relative to their younger counterparts. The aim of this review was to summarize the most recent considerations in regards to preoperative assessment, postoperative outcomes, patient satisfaction and cost-effectiveness analysis of day surgery in the elderly. METHODS: This review considered studies that included older patients who were undergoing day surgery general procedures (such as inguinal hernia repair, excision of breast lump, haemorrhoidectomy). The interventions of interest to this review included selection criteria, perioperative care, management of postoperative pain. RESULTS: According to a large number of studies, old age does not constitute a contraindication for elderly to undergo ambulatory surgery but this population may require more careful intraoperative cardiovascular management. Hospitalization of older patients is frequently associated with postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Management of postoperative pain in older patients may be complicated by a number of factors, including a higher risk of age- and disease-related changes in physiology and disease-drug and drug-drug interactions. Early studies evaluating approaches to facilitating the recovery process have demonstrated the benefits of multimodal analgesic techniques.

Using either a General Cognitive Performance composite (GCP) or individual test scores as outcomes, we performed linear mixed effects models to examine main effects of AD-signature atrophy and the interaction of AD-signature atrophy and delirium on slopes of cognitive change from post-operative months 2-36. Results: Reduced baseline AD-signature cortical thickness was associated with greater 36-month cognitive decline in GCP (standardized beta coefficient, β = -0.030, 95% confidence interval [-0.060, -0.001]). Patients who developed delirium who also had thinner AD signature cortex showed greater decline on a verbal learning test (β = -0.100 [-0.192, -0.007]). Conclusion: Patients with the greatest baseline AD-related cortical atrophy who develop delirium after elective surgery appear to experience the greatest long-term cognitive decline. Thus, atrophy suggestive of preclinical AD and the development of delirium may be high-risk indicators for long-term cognitive decline following surgery. © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

Unfortunately, it has high rates of perioperative morbidity and mortality. One of the most important predictors of postoperative outcomes is frailty, while the majority of complications are diversion related. The aim of our study was to evaluate safety of extraperitoneal cystectomy with ureterocutaneostomy in patients considered as frail. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively collected data of frail patients who underwent extraperitoneal cystectomy with ureterocutaneostomy from October 2018 to August 2020 in a single center. We evaluated frailty by assessing patients' age, body mass index (BMI), nutritional status by Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool, overall health by RAI (Risk Analysis Index) and ASA (American Society of Anaesthesiologists) score, and laboratory analyses. We observed intraoperative outcomes and rates of perioperative (within 30 days) and early postoperative (within 90 days) complications (Clavien-Dindo classification). We defined extraperitoneal cystectomy with ureterocutaneostomy as safe if patients did not develop Clavien Dindo IIIb, or worse, complication. RESULTS: A total of 34 patients, 3 female and 31 male, were analyzed. The median age was 77, BMI 26, RAI 28, ASA 3 and the majority had preexisting renal insufficiency. Blood analyses revealed presence of severe preoperative hypoalbuminemia and anemia in half of our cohort. Intraoperative median blood loss was 250 cc, whilst operative time 245 min. During perioperative period 60% of our cohort developed Clavien Dindo II complication and during early postoperative period 32% of patients required readmission. One death occurred during early postoperative period (2.9%). After 12 months of follow-up, we observed stability of the renal function for most patients. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that extraperitoneal cystectomy with ureterocutaneostomy could be considered as a treatment option for elderly and/or frail patients.",duplicate of 16923,,"Level 1, Title abstract screening",

Laser laryngeal surgery (LLS) requires the administration of low levels of oxygen, which may increase the risk of desaturation and brain function impairment. This prospective randomized trial aimed to compare the effects of desflurane and propofol-based general anesthesia on the occurrence of early postoperative cognitive decline in elderly patients undergoing LLS. METHODS: Seventy-three patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists grade I or II and at least 65 years of age were randomly allocated to receive either desflurane-based (Group D) or propofol-based (Group P) anesthesia during LLS. The standard anesthesia protocol was performed, with a bispectral index between 40 and 60 and a mean arterial pressure within 20% of baseline values. Intraoperative regional oxygen saturation values were recorded. Each patient was assessed using the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) test during the preoperative period (baseline), 30 min after extubation in the postanesthesia care unit, and 1, 3, and 24 h after surgery. RESULTS: MMSE scores improved slightly in both groups compared to baseline during the early postoperative period, but these increases were not statistically significant. No significant differences were identified in MMSE scores between groups. Only three patients (9.6%) in group D and one patient (3.1%) in group P developed cognitive impairment (p = 0.583). CONCLUSION: Low intraoperative inspired oxygen concentration during short-duration LLS did not reduce early postoperative cognitive function in elderly patients. Desflurane or propofol-based anesthesia had similar effects on early neurocognition after LLS.

Subanaesthetic ketamine is often administered intraoperatively for postoperative analgesia, and some evidence suggests that ketamine prevents delirium. The primary purpose of this trial was to assess the effectiveness of ketamine for prevention of postoperative delirium in older adults. METHODS: The Prevention of Delirium and Complications Associated with Surgical Treatments [PODCAST] study is a multicentre, international randomised trial that enrolled adults older than 60 years undergoing major cardiac and non-cardiac surgery under general anaesthesia. Using a computer-generated randomisation sequence we randomly assigned patients to one of three groups in blocks of 15 to receive placebo (normal saline), low-dose ketamine (0·5 mg/kg), or high dose ketamine (1·0 mg/kg) after induction of anaesthesia, before surgical incision. Participants, clinicians, and investigators were blinded to group assignment. Delirium was assessed twice daily in the first 3 postoperative days using the Confusion Assessment Method. We did analyses by intention-to-treat and assessed adverse events. This trial is registered with clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT01690988. FINDINGS: Between Feb 6, 2014, and June 26, 2016, 1360 patients were assessed, and 672 were randomly assigned, with 222 in the placebo group, 227 in the 0·5 mg/kg ketamine group, and 223 in the 1·0 mg/kg ketamine group. There was no difference in delirium incidence between patients in the combined ketamine groups and the placebo group (19·45% vs 19·82%, respectively; absolute difference 0·36%, 95% CI -6·07 to 7·38, p=0·92). There were more postoperative hallucinations (p=0·01) and nightmares (p=0·03) with increasing ketamine doses compared with placebo. Adverse events (cardiovascular, renal, infectious, gastrointestinal, and bleeding), whether viewed individually (p value for each >0·40) or collectively (36·9% in placebo, 39·6% in 0·5 mg/kg ketamine, and 40·8% in 1·0 mg/kg ketamine groups, p=0·69), did not differ significantly across groups. INTERPRETATION: A single subanaesthetic dose of ketamine did not decrease delirium in older adults after major surgery, and might cause harm by inducing negative experiences.

METHODS: Thirty patients (> 65 yr) undergoing hip fracture repair were randomly allocated to receive unilateral spinal anaesthesia with hyperbaric bupivacaine 7.5 mg 0.5% (Group Spinal, n = 15) or volatile induction and maintenance anaesthesia with sevoflurane (Group SEVO, n = 15). General anaesthesia was induced by increasing the inspired concentration to 5%. A laryngeal mask airway was placed without muscle relaxants, and the end-tidal concentrations of sevoflurane were adjusted to maintain cardiovascular stability. Hypotension (decrease in systolic arterial pressure > 20% from baseline), hypertension or bradycardia (heart rate < 50 beats min(-1)) requiring treatment, and the length of stay in the postanaesthesia care unit was recorded. Cognitive functions were evaluated the previous day, and 1 and 7 days after surgery with the Mini Mental State Examination test. RESULTS: Hypotension occurred in seven patients of Group Spinal (46%) and in 12 patients of Group SEVO (80%) (P = 0.05). Phenylephrine was required to control hypotension in three spinal patients (21%) and four SEVO patients (26%) (n.s.). SEVO patients had lower heart rates than spinal patients from 15 to 60 min after anaesthesia induction (P = 0.01). Bradycardia was observed in three SEVO patients (22%). Discharge from the postanaesthesia care unit required 15 (range 5-30) min in Group Spinal and 55 (15-80) min in Group SEVO (P = 0.0005). Eight patients in Group Spinal (53%) and nine patients in Group SEVO (60%) showed cognitive decline (Mini Mental State Examination test decreased > or = 2 points from baseline) 24 h after surgery (n.s.). Seven days after surgery, confusion was still present in one patient of Group Spinal (6%) and in three patients of Group SEVO (20%) (n.s.). CONCLUSIONS: In elderly patients undergoing hemiarthroplasty of the hip, induction and maintenance with sevoflurane provide a rapid emergence from anaesthesia without more depression of postoperative cognitive function compared with unilateral spinal anaesthesia. This technique represents an attractive option when patient refusal, lack of adequate co-operation or concomitant anticoagulant therapy contraindicate the use of spinal anaesthesia.",duplicate of 14441,,"Level 1, Title abstract screening",

However, in elderly patients, cognitive dysfunction following surgery may impair the outcome of surgical procedures. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) has been demonstrated to have a neuroprotectve effect in animal experiments. However, it is unclear whether DEX also has a neuroprotective effect in human patients. The present study was a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind trial of 126 patients who had undergone laparoscopic cholecystectomy, using clinical interviews to determine whether intravenously administrated DEX during general anesthesia ameliorates cognitive function impairment. The cognitive deficit of each patient was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The scores on the MMSE for the DEX and control groups one week after surgery (DEX group, 27.6+/-1.2; control group, 25.7+/-1.5) were significantly different (P=0.005). The MMSE scores of patients </=65 years old were significantly higher than those of patients >65 one week after surgery. The MMSE scores were significantly different between the two age groups in the control patients (</=65 years old, 28.3+/-1.2; >65 years old, 26.6+/-2.1; P=0.036), while the difference was not statistically significant in the DEX-treated patients. Eight patients in the DEX group and 15 patients in the control group had mild cognitive impairment (26>/= MMSE score >/=21) although the difference was not statistically significant. The findings of the present study support the hypothesis that DEX administration may be an effective method for ameliorating postoperative cognitive impairment in elderly patients who have undergone laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Patients with a history of serious mental illness, delirium, and severe dementia were excluded. Upon admission to intensive care unit (ICU), patients received either dexmedetomidine (0.4 mug/kg bolus followed by 0.2 to 0.7 mug kg h infusion) or propofol (25 to 50 mug kg min infusion) according to a computer-generated randomization code in blocks of four.

METHODS: This retrospective propensity-matched cohort study utilizing the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) database included patients who had undergone total hip arthroplasty from 2007 through 2011. After matching, logistic regression was used to determine the association between the type of anesthesia and deep surgical site infections, hospital length of stay, thirty-day mortality, and cardiovascular and pulmonary complications. RESULTS: Of 12,929 surgical procedures, 5103 (39.5%) were performed with regional anesthesia.

METHODS: We analysed retrospectively anaesthesia and hospital records of patients who were over 100 years old when undergoing major emergency surgery in our hospital during 1990-2004. RESULTS: Altogether, 12 patients (median age 101 years) underwent 14 operations (nine for hip fracture, four for lower extremity circulatory problems and one for peritonitis). During anaesthesia, invasive arterial pressure was monitored in eight patients while central venous pressure (CVP) was monitored in only one patient. Spinal anaesthesia with bupivacaine was given as a continuous technique in six and as single-shot spinal anaesthesia in five cases. Both spinal (11) and general (3) anaesthesias were characterized by marked drops in arterial pressure. Haemodynamics was managed with intravenous (i.v.) fluids and vasopressors. Five patients had post-operative delirium. Mortality at 30 days, 6 months and 1 year was 25%, 42% and 50%, respectively. Within 15 days of the operation, three patients had died (pneumonia, cerebral infarction and myocardial infarction). Nine patients returned home and six of them lived in their pre-operative mental and physical state for at least a year. CONCLUSION: Independently of the anaesthetic method, marked drops in blood pressure occurred, requiring pharmacological intervention.

The primary outcome was postoperative delirium as measured by the Confusion Assessment Method. Secondary outcomes were postoperative pain, opioid use, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Data for 697 patients were included, with a mean +/- SD age of 72 +/- 6 yr.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of perioperative dexmedetomidine administration on the incidence of delirium in elderly patients after cardiac surgery. METHODS: This randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled trial was conducted in two tertiary hospitals in Beijing between December 1, 2014 and July 19, 2015. Eligible patients were randomized into two groups. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) was administered during anesthesia and early postoperative period for patients in the DEX group, whereas normal saline was administered in the same rate for the same duration for patients in the control (CTRL) group. The primary endpoint was the incidence of delirium during the first five days after surgery.

Dexmedetomidine decreased the required treatment for intraoperative tachycardia (21.1% [30/142] in the DEX group vs 33.6% [48/143] in the CTRL group, p = 0.019), but increased the required treatment for postoperative hypotension (84.5% [120/142] in the DEX group vs 69.9% [100/143] in the CTRL group, p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Dexmedetomidine administered during anesthesia and early postoperative period did not decrease the incidence of postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. However, considering the low delirium incidence, the trial might have been underpowered. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02267538.",duplicate of 24,,"Level 1, Title abstract screening",

Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is neuroprotective for delirium. In this study, we determined the effect of intravenously administered DEX during general anesthesia on POD in elderly aMCI patients undergoing elective hip joint or knee joint or shoulder joint replacement surgery. METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized parallel-group study of aMCI (n = 80) and normal elderly patients (n = 120). Prior to surgery, all subjects underwent neuropsychological assessment and were assigned to one of four groups: the aMCI DEX group (MD group, n = 40), the aMCI normal saline group (MN group, n = 40), the control DEX group (CD group, n = 60), and the control normal saline group (CN group, n = 60). The confusion assessment method was used to screen POD on postoperative days 1, 3, and 7. RESULTS: We found patients age was positively correlated with POD incidence in the MN group (p < 0.05) but not in the CN group (p < 0.05). DEX treatment significantly decreased POD incidence in both control and aMCI groups relative to their respective placebo groups (all p < 0.05). The fraction of patients whose normal cognitive function was not restored by day 7 after surgery was significantly higher in the MN group than the MD and CN groups (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggested that DEX treatment during surgery significantly reduced POD incidence in both normal and aMCI elderly patients, suggesting that it may be an effective option for the prevention of POD.",duplicate of 1419,,"Level 1, Title abstract screening",

M.",Reducing delirium after hip fracture: a randomized trial,"OBJECTIVES: Delirium (or acute confusional state) affects 35% to 65% of patients after hip-fracture repair, and has been independently associated with poor functional recovery. We performed a randomized trial in an orthopedic surgery service at an academic hospital to determine whether proactive geriatrics consultation can reduce delirium after hip fracture. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, blinded. SETTING: Inpatient academic tertiary medical center. PARTICIPANTS: 126 consenting patients 65 and older (mean age 79 +/- 8 years, 79% women) admitted emergently for surgical repair of hip fracture. MEASUREMENTS: Detailed assessment through interviews with patients and designated proxies and review of medical records was performed at enrollment to ascertain prefracture status. Subjects were then randomized to proactive geriatrics consultation, which began preoperatively or within 24 hours of surgery, or ""usual care."" A geriatrician made daily visits for the duration of the hospitalization and made targeted recommendations based on a structured protocol. To ascertain study outcomes, all subjects underwent daily, blinded interviews for the duration of their hospitalization, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Delirium Symptom Interview (DSI), and the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS). Delirium was diagnosed using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) algorithm. RESULTS: The 62 patients randomized to geriatrics consultation were not significantly different (P>.1) from the 64 usual-care patients in terms of age, gender, prefracture dementia, comorbidity, type of hip fracture, or type of surgical repair. Sixty-one percent of geriatrics consultation patients were seen preoperatively and all were seen within 24 hours postoperatively. A mean of 10 recommendations were made throughout the duration of the hospitalization, with 77% adherence by the orthopedics team. Delirium occurred in 20 /62 (32%) intervention patients, versus 32 / 64 (50%) usual-care patients (P =.04), representing a relative risk of 0.64 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.37-0.98) for the consultation group. One case of delirium was prevented for every 5.6 patients in the geriatrics consultation group. There was an even greater reduction in cases of severe delirium, occurring in 7/ 60 (12%) of intervention patients and 18 / 62 (29%) of usual-care patients, with a relative risk of 0.40 (95% CI = 0.18-0.89). Despite this reduction in delirium, length of stay did not significantly differ between intervention and usual-care groups (median +/- interquartile range = 5 +/- 2 days in both groups), likely because protocols and pathways predetermined length of stay. In subgroup analyses, geriatrics consultation was most effective in reducing delirium in patients without prefracture dementia or activities of daily living (ADL) functional impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Proactive geriatrics consultation was successfully implemented with good adherence after hip-fracture repair. Geriatrics consultation reduced delirium by over one-third, and reduced severe delirium by over one-half. Our trial provides strong preliminary evidence that proactive geriatrics consultation may play an important role in the acute hospital management of hip-fracture patients.",duplicate of 741,,"Level 1, Title abstract screening",

No study has compared the haemodynamic effect of hypobaric unilateral spinal anaesthesia (HUSA) and standardised general anaesthesia (GA) in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgical repair. METHODS: We performed a prospective, randomised open study, including 40 patients aged over 75 years, comparing the haemodynamic effects of HUSA (5 mg isobaric bupivacaine with 5 μg sufentanil and 1 mL sterile water) and GA (induction with etomidate/remifentanil and maintenance with desflurane/remifentanil). An incidence of severe hypotension, defined by a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >40% from baseline, was the primary endpoint. RESULTS: The incidence of severe hypotension was lower in the HUSA group compared with that in the GA group (32% vs. 71%, respectively, p=0.03). The median [IQR] ephedrine consumption was lower (p=0.001) in the HUSA group (6 mg, 0-17 mg) compared with that in the GA group (36 mg, 21-57 mg). Intraoperative muscle relaxation and patients' and surgeons' satisfaction were similar between groups. No difference was observed in 5-day complications or 30-day mortality. CONCLUSION: This study shows that HUSA provides better haemodynamic stability than GA, with lower consumption of ephedrine and similar operating conditions.

The authors investigated whether parecoxib-supplemented IV morphine analgesia could decrease the incidence of delirium in elderly patients after total hip or knee replacement surgery. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, 2-center trial, patients of 60 years or older who underwent elective total hip or knee replacement surgery were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either parecoxib (40 mg at the end of surgery and then every 12 hours for 3 days) or placebo (normal saline). All patients received combined spinal-epidural anesthesia during surgery and IV morphine for postoperative analgesia. The primary outcome was the incidence of delirium within 5 days after surgery. RESULTS: Between January 2011 and May 2013, 620 patients were enrolled and were included in the intention-to-treat and safety analyses. The incidence of delirium was significantly reduced from 11.0% (34/310) with placebo to 6.2% (19/310) with parecoxib (relative risk 0.56, 95% confidence interval 0.33-0.96, P = .031). The severity of pain and the cumulative consumptions of morphine at 24, 48, and 72 hours after surgery were significantly lower with parecoxib than with placebo (all P < .001), although the differences were small.

METHODS: The authors evaluated the effect of type of anesthesia on postoperative mortality and morbidity in a retrospective cohort study of consecutive hip fracture patients, aged 60 yr or older, who underwent surgical repair at 20 US hospitals between 1983 and 1993. The primary outcome was defined as death within 30 days of the operative procedure. The secondary outcomes were postoperative 7-day mortality, postoperative myocardial infarction, postoperative pneumonia, postoperative congestive heart failure, and postoperative change in mental status. Numerous comorbid conditions were controlled for individually and by several comorbidity indices using logistic regression. RESULTS: General anesthesia was used in 6,206 patients (65.8%) and regional anesthesia in 3,219 patients (3,078 spinal anesthesia and 141 epidural anesthesia). The 30-day mortality rate in the general anesthesia group was 4.4%, compared with 5.4% in the regional anesthesia group (unadjusted odds ratio = 0.80; 95% confidence interval = 0.66-0.97). However, the adjusted odds ratio for general anesthesia increased to 1.08 (0.84-1.38). The adjusted odds ratios for general anesthesia versus regional anesthesia for the 7-day mortality was 0.90 (0.59-1.39) and for postoperative morbidity outcomes were as follows: myocardial infarction: adjusted odds ratio = 1.17 (0.80-1.70); congestive heart failure: adjusted odds ratio = 1.04 (0.80-1.36); pneumonia: adjusted odds ratio = 1.21 (0.87-1.68); postoperative change in mental status: adjusted odds ratio = 1.08 (0.95-1.22).

BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium is a common and deleterious complication in geriatric patients. METHODS: Subjects older than 50 years scheduled for an operation requiring a postoperative intensive care unit admission were recruited. After preoperative informed written consent, enrolled subjects had baseline cognitive and functional assessments. Postoperatively, subjects were assessed daily for delirium using the confusion assessment method-intensive care unit. Patients were also followed for outcomes. RESULTS: During the study period, 144 patients were enrolled before major abdominal (40%), thoracic (53%), or vascular (7%) operations. The overall incidence of delirium was 44% (64/144). The average time to onset of delirium was 2.1 +/- 0.9 days and the mean duration of delirium was 4.0 +/- 5.1 days. Several preoperative variables were associated with an increased risk of delirium including older age (P < 0.001), hypoalbuminemia (P < 0.001), impaired functional status (P < 0.001), pre-existing dementia (P < 0.001), and pre-existing comorbidities (P < 0.001). In a multivariable logistic regression model, pre-existing dementia remains the strongest risk factor for the development of postoperative delirium. Worse outcomes, including increased length of stay (P < 0.001), postdischarge institutionalization (P < 0.001), and 6 month mortality (P = 0.001), occurred in subjects who developed delirium.

We investigated whether prophylactic low-dose dexmedetomidine, a highly selective alpha(2) adrenoceptor agonist, could safely decrease the incidence of delirium in elderly patients after non-cardiac surgery. METHODS: We did this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in two tertiary-care hospitals in Beijing, China. We enrolled patients aged 65 years or older, who were admitted to intensive care units after non-cardiac surgery, with informed consent. We used a computer-generated randomisation sequence (in a 1:1 ratio) to randomly assign patients to receive either intravenous dexmedetomidine (0.1 mug/kg per h, from intensive care unit admission on the day of surgery until 0800 h on postoperative day 1), or placebo (intravenous normal saline). Participants, care providers, and investigators were all masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was the incidence of delirium, assessed twice daily with the Confusion Assessment Method for intensive care units during the first 7 postoperative days. Analyses were done by intention-to-treat and safety populations. This study is registered with Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, www.chictr.org.cn, number ChiCTR-TRC-10000802. FINDINGS: Between Aug 17, 2011, and Nov 20, 2013, of 2016 patients assessed, 700 were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (n=350) or dexmedetomidine (n=350). The incidence of postoperative delirium was significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group (32 [9%] of 350 patients) than in the placebo group (79 [23%] of 350 patients; odds ratio [OR] 0.35, 95% CI 0.22-0.54; p<0.0001). Regarding safety, the incidence of hypertension was higher with placebo (62 [18%] of 350 patients) than with dexmedetomidine (34 [10%] of 350 patients; 0.50, 0.32-0.78; p=0.002). Tachycardia was also higher in patients given placebo (48 [14%] of 350 patients) than in patients given dexmedetomidine (23 [7%] of 350 patients; 0.44, 0.26-0.75; p=0.002).

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of postoperative intravenous (IV) acetaminophen (paracetamol) vs placebo combined with IV propofol vs dexmedetomidine on postoperative delirium among older patients undergoing cardiac surgery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, placebo-controlled, factorial clinical trial among 120 patients aged 60 years or older undergoing on-pump coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery or combined CABG/valve surgeries at a US center. Enrollment was September 2015 to April 2018, with follow-up ending in April 2019. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to 1 of 4 groups receiving postoperative analgesia with IV acetaminophen or placebo every 6 hours for 48 hours and postoperative sedation with dexmedetomidine or propofol starting at chest closure and continued for up to 6 hours (acetaminophen and dexmedetomidine: n = 29; placebo and dexmedetomidine: n = 30; acetaminophen and propofol: n = 31; placebo and propofol: n = 30). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was incidence of postoperative in-hospital delirium by the Confusion Assessment Method. Secondary outcomes included delirium duration, cognitive decline, breakthrough analgesia within the first 48 hours, and ICU and hospital length of stay. RESULTS: Among 121 patients randomized (median age, 69 years; 19 women [15.8%]), 120 completed the trial. Patients treated with IV acetaminophen had a significant reduction in delirium (10% vs 28% placebo; difference, -18% [95% CI, -32% to -5%]; P = .01; HR, 2.8 [95% CI, 1.1-7.8]).

There were significant differences favoring acetaminophen vs placebo for 3 prespecified secondary outcomes: delirium duration (median, 1 vs 2 days; difference, -1 [95% CI, -2 to 0]), ICU length of stay (median, 29.5 vs 46.7 hours; difference, -16.7 [95% CI, -20.3 to -0.8]), and breakthrough analgesia (median, 322.5 vs 405.3 microg morphine equivalents; difference, -83 [95% CI, -154 to -14]). For dexmedetomidine vs propofol, only breakthrough analgesia was significantly different (median, 328.8 vs 397.5 microg; difference, -69 [95% CI, -155 to -4]; P = .04). Fourteen patients in both the placebo-dexmedetomidine and acetaminophen-propofol groups (46% and 45%) and 7 in the acetaminophen-dexmedetomidine and placebo-propofol groups (24% and 23%) had hypotension. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among older patients undergoing cardiac surgery, postoperative scheduled IV acetaminophen, combined with IV propofol or dexmedetomidine, reduced in-hospital delirium vs placebo. Additional research, including comparison of IV vs oral acetaminophen and other potentially opioid-sparing analgesics, on the incidence of postoperative delirium is warranted.

S.",Assessment of role of perioperative melatonin in prevention and treatment of postoperative delirium after hip arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia in the elderly,CONTEXT: Little is known about the relationship between sedative drugs used preoperatively and postoperative delirium. Melatonin is a drug used to sedate patients preoperatively and is hypothesized by recent works to have a curative effect on postoperative delirium. AIMS: The incidence of postoperative delirium will be tested if affected by three different sedative drugs including melatonin. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Controlled randomized doubleblind study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three-hundred patients aged>65 years scheduled for hip arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia were randomly distributed to one of the four groups. Group 1 (control) received nothing for sedation. Group 2 (melatonin) received 5 mg melatonin. Group 3 (midazolam) received 7.5 mg midazolam. Group 4 (clonidine) received 100 μg clonidine. These medications were given orally at sleep time at night of operation and another dose 90 min before operative time. Patients who developed postoperative delirium received 5 mg of melatonin 9 pm for three successive days in a trial to treat delirium. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Statistical analysis was done using the SPSS Software (version 13). RESULTS: Total of 222 patients completed the study. Percentage of postoperative delirium in the control group was 32.65% (16/49 patients). The melatonin group showed a statistically significant decrease in the percentage of postoperative delirium to 9.43% (5/53 patients). Melatonin was successful in treating 58.06% of patients suffered postoperative delirium (36/62 patients) with no difference between different groups. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative delirium is affected with the drug used for preoperative sedation. Melatonin was successful in decreasing postoperative delirium when used preoperatively and in treating more than half of patients developed postoperative delirium when used for three postoperative nights.,duplicate of 5164,,"Level 1, Title abstract screening",

DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial in two centers. SETTING: Intensive care units of two large tertiary teaching hospitals. PATIENTS: Four hundred fifty-seven patients 65 yrs or older who were admitted to the intensive care unit after noncardiac surgery. INTERVENTION: Haloperidol (0.5 mg intravenous bolus injection followed by continuous infusion at a rate of 0.1 mg/h for 12 hrs; n = 229) or placebo (n = 228) was randomly administered from intensive care unit admission. MEASURES: The primary end point was the incidence of delirium within the first 7 days after surgery. Secondary end points included time to onset of delirium, number of delirium-free days, length of intensive care unit stay, all-cause 28-day mortality, and adverse events. Delirium was assessed using the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit. RESULTS: The incidence of delirium during the first 7 days after surgery was 15.3% (35/229) in the haloperidol group and 23.2% (53/228) in the control group (p = .031). The mean time to onset of delirium and the mean number of delirium-free days were significantly longer (6.2 days [95% confidence interval 5.9-6.4] vs. 5.7 days [95% confidence interval 5.4-6.0]; p = .021; and 6.8 ± 0.5 days vs. 6.7 ± 0.8 days; p = .027, respectively), whereas the median length of intensive care unit stay was significantly shorter (21.3 hrs [95% confidence interval 20.3-22.2] vs. 23.0 hrs [95% confidence interval 20.9-25.1]; p = .024) in the haloperidol group than in the control group. There was no significant difference with regard to all-cause 28-day mortality between the two groups (0.9% [2/229] vs. 2.6% [6/228]; p = .175). No drug-related side effects were documented.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Our study included 80 patients randomly divided into 2 equal groups: the DEX group and the control group. In the DEX group, our patients received an initial dose of DEX at 1 microg/kg for 10 min followed by a continuous infusion at 0.3 microg/kg/h until the end of surgery. The control group received a saline treatment, and neurological tests were performed to assess the status of POCD. Serum level of b-amyloid protein (Abeta) and neuronal microtubule-associated protein (Tau) were measured at designated time points: at pre-operation (T1), 0.5 h after the anhepatic phase (T2), 2 h after the reperfusion of the new liver (T3), at the completion of operation (T4), at day 1 (T5), and at day 7 (T6) after the operation. RESULTS The incidence of POCD was significantly reduced in the DEX group (P=0.017). The score from the neurological tests was significantly decreased in the control group after the operation, but no statistical difference was observed in the DEX group. The DEX groups demonstrated a lower level of beta-amyloid and Tau protein than those at the corresponding time points (T4~T6) in the control group (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS Dexmedetomidine reduced the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction in orthotopic liver transplantation patients.

METHOD: Eighty cases receiving selective radical surgery for gastric cancer were included. They were aged 65-78 years and classified as ASA grade I-II. Using a random number table, the cases were divided into 4 groups (n = 20): propofol intravenous general anesthesia (P group), sevoflurane inhalation general anesthesia (S group), propofol intravenous general anesthesia combined with epidural block (PE group), and sevoflurane inhalation general anesthesia combined with epidural block (SE group). For P and PE group, target controlled infusion of propofol was performed; for S and SE group, sevoflurane was inhaled to induce and maintain general anesthesia; for PE and SE group, before general anesthesia induction, epidural puncture and catheterization at T7-8 was performed. After surgery, perform patient controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) or patient controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA), and maintain VAS ≤ 3. The recorded indicators were as follows: time to recovery of spontaneous respiration, time to awakening, time of endotracheal tube removal, time to orientation, time to achieve modified Aldrete scores ≥ 9, modified OAA/S and Aldrete scores upon endotracheal tube removal (T1), 5 min after removal (T2), 15 min after removal (T3) and 30 min after removal (T4), dose of intraoperative remifentanil, intraoperative hypotension, and emergence agitation. RESULTS: Time to awakening, time of endotracheal tube removal, time to orientation, and time to achieve modified Aldrete scores ≥ 9 in PE and SE group were obviously shortened compared with P and S group (P < 0.05); modified OAA/S and Aldrete scores at T1 and T2 in PE and SE group were significantly higher than those in P and S group (P < 0.05), and the scores of SE group at T1 were much higher compared to PE group (P < 0.05). Dose of intraoperative remifentanil in PE and SE group was significantly lower than that in P and S group. CONCLUSION: Compared to propofol intravenous general anesthesia or sevoflurane inhalation general anesthesia, propofol or sevoflurane general anesthesia combined with epidural block was more conducive to increasing the awakening quality of the senile patients from anesthesia after radical gastric cancer surgery. Moreover, sevofluorane inhalation general anesthesia combined with epidural block achieved a more stable hemodynamics and a shortened time to awakening.",duplicate of 6172,,"Level 1, Title abstract screening",

For patients who underwent cardiac surgery and require extracorporeal circulation support, the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is higher than in other types of surgery due to greater changes in brain perfusion compared with normal physiological conditions. Recent studies have confirmed that the use of ulinastatin or dexmedetomidine in the perioperative period effectively reduces the incidence of POCD. In this study, ulinastatin was combined with dexmedetomidine to assess whether the combination of the two drugs could reduce the incidence of POCD. Methods: One hundred and eighty patients with heart valve replacement surgery undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass from August 2017 to December 2018 were enrolled, with age 60-80 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grades I-III, education level above elementary school, and either gender. According to the random number table method, patients were grouped into ulinastatin + dexmedetomidine (U+D) group, ulinastatin (U) group, dexmedetomidine (D) group, and normal saline (N) control group. Group U was pumped 20,000 UI/kg immediately after induction and the first day after surgery, group D continued to pump 0.4 mug/kg/h from induction to 2 h before extubation, group U+D dexmedetomidine 0.4 mug/kg/h + ulinastatin 20,000 UI/kg, and group N equal volume of physiological saline. The patients were enrolled with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) before surgery. The cognitive function was assessed by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) on the first day before surgery and on the seventh day after surgery. Inflammatory factors, such as S100beta protein, interleukin (IL)-6, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, were detected in peripheral blood before anesthesia (T0), immediately after surgery (T1), and immediately after extubation (T2). Results: One hundred and fifty-four patients enrolled in this study. Compared with group N, the incidence of POCD in group U+D was the lowest (P < 0.05), followed by group U and group D. Group U+D had the lowest concentration of inflammatory factors at the T1 and T2 time points, followed by group U and group D. Conclusions: Both ulinastatin and dexmedetomidine can reduce the perioperative inflammatory response and the incidence of POCD in patients with heart valve surgery, and their combination can better reduce the incidence of POCD.",duplicate of 13406,,"Level 1, Title abstract screening",

Since disorders of the sleep-wake cycle have been reported to be one of the key factors in POD, we attempted to clarify the effectiveness of improving sleep-wake cycle disorders with medication after surgery to prevent POD, by conducting a prospective randomized study of 42 elderly patients who underwent resection of either gastric or colon cancer through an open laparotomy. METHODS: The delirium-free protocol (DFP) group was given an intramuscular injection of diazepam at 20:00 h each night, as well as a continuous intravenous infusion of flunitrazepam and pethidine administered over 8 h, for the first three nights postoperatively. Two patients were excluded because of failure to complete the DFP. RESULTS: The incidence of POD was 7/20 (35.0%) in the non-DFP group and 1/20 (5.0%) in the DFP group, this difference being significant (P = 0.023). Morning lethargy produced by the DFP was observed in 40% of the DFP group; however, no other side effects were seen. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that DFP treatment is effective for controlling POD in elderly patients after general surgery and does not appear to be associated with severe complications or side effects. To our knowledge, this is the first report proposing artificial control of the sleep-awake rhythm by medication as a means of preventing POD in elderly patients.",duplicate of 9620,,,

A predictive model is needed to identify high-risk patients in order to apply strategies which will prevent and/or reduce adverse outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To identify the incidence of, and the risk factors for, postoperative delirium (POD) in surgical intensive care unit (SICU) patients, and to determine predictive scores for the development of POD. METHODS: This study enrolled adults aged over 18 years who had undergone an operation within the preceding week and who had been admitted to a SICU for a period that was expected to be longer than 24 h. The CAM - ICU score was used to determine the occurrence of delirium. RESULTS: Of the 250 patients enrolled, delirium was found in 61 (24.4%). The independent risk factors for delirium that were identified by a multivariate analysis comprised age, diabetes mellitus, severity of disease (SOFA score), perioperative use of benzodiazepine, and mechanical ventilation. A predictive score (age + (5 x SOFA) + (15 x Benzodiazepine use) + (20 x DM) + (20 x mechanical ventilation) + (20 x modified IQCODE > 3.42)) was created. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.786 to 0.897). The cut point of 125 demonstrated a sensitivity of 72.13% and a specificity of 80.95%, and the hospital mortality rate was significantly greater among the delirious than the non-delirious patients (25% vs. 6%, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: POD was experienced postoperatively by a quarter of the surgical patients who were critically ill. A risk score utilizing 6 variables was able to predict which patients would develop POD. The identification of high-risk patients following SICU admission can provide a basis for intervention strategies to improve outcomes.

Therefore, this study aimed to compare the use of dexmedetomidine and midazolam regarding proper sedation and postoperative complications in elderly individuals who require intraoperative sedation. METHODS: This study was a parallel-randomized clinical trial, which included 120 patients aged >70 years undergoing regional anesthesia and sedation. The exclusion criteria consisted of bradycardia, heart failure, respiratory failure, a Glasgow Coma Scale </=14, liver failure and refusal to participate. Patients were divided into two groups: the first group received midazolam (MDZ), while the second group received dexmedetomidine (DEX). The doses were titrated to achieve an intraoperative Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) score between -3 and -1. Incidences of complications were recorded. RESULTS: During a 120 min follow-up, the depth of sedation (RASS score) revealed variations less often in the DEX group (p=0.002). Patients in the DEX group (n=67) had lower rates of intraoperative complications (19.4% vs 73.6%, p<0.001). Intraoperatively, the incidence rates of psychomotor agitation (15.1% vs 1.5%, p=0.005), arterial hypotension (28.3% vs 3.0%, p<0.001) and respiratory depression (73.6% vs 0%, p<0.001) were higher in the MDZ group (n=53). During postanesthesia care, the incidence rates of shivering (p<0.001), residual sedation (p=0.04) and use of supplemental oxygen (p<0.001) were significantly lower in the DEX group.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5th edition (DSM-5) is the golden standard for diagnosing perioperative NCDs. Given the impracticality of using the DSM-5 by non-psychiatric practitioners, many diagnostic tools have been developed and validated for different clinical scenarios. The etiology of perioperative NCDs is multifactorial and includes predisposing and precipitating factors. Identifying these risk factors is conducive to preoperative risk stratification and perioperative risk reduction. Prevention for perioperative NCDs should include avoiding possible contributors and implementing nonpharmacologic and pharmacological interventions. The former generally includes avoiding benzodiazepines, anticholinergics, prolonged liquid fasting, deep anesthesia, cerebral oxygen desaturation, and intraoperative hypothermia. Nonpharmacologic measures include preoperative cognitive prehabilitation, comprehensive geriatric assessment, implementing fast-track surgery, combined use of regional block, and sleep promotion. Pharmacological measures including dexmedetomidine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and acetaminophen are found to have beneficial effects. Nonpharmacological treatments are the first-line measures for established perioperative NCDs.

DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Various databases were searched from their inception dates to March 8, 2021. SETTING: Preoperative assessment. PATIENTS: Older patients (≥ 60 years) undergoing non-cardiac surgery. MEASUREMENTS: Outcomes included postoperative delirium, mortality, discharge to assisted care, 30-day readmissions, postoperative complications, and length of hospital stay. Effect sizes were calculated as Odds Ratio (OR) and Mean Difference (MD) based on random effect model analysis. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk Bias Tool for RCTs and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational cohort studies. RESULTS: Fifty-three studies (196,491 patients) were included. Preoperative CI was associated with a significant risk of delirium in older patients after non-cardiac surgery (25.1% vs. 10.3%; OR: 3.84; 95%CI: 2.35, 6.26; I(2): 76%; p < 0.00001). Cognitive impairment (26.2% vs. 13.2%; OR: 2.28; 95%CI: 1.39, 3.74; I(2): 73%; p = 0.001) and dementia (41.6% vs. 25.5%; OR: 1.96; 95%CI: 1.34, 2.88; I(2): 99%; p = 0.0006) significantly increased risk for 1-year mortality. In patients with CI, there was an increased risk of discharge to assisted care (44.7% vs. 38.3%; OR 1.74; 95%CI: 1.05, 2.89, p = 0.03), 30-day readmissions (14.3% vs. 10.8%; OR: 1.36; 95%CI: 1.00, 1.84, p = 0.05), and postoperative complications (40.7% vs. 18.8%; OR: 1.85; 95%CI: 1.37, 2.49; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative CI in older surgical patients significantly increases risk of delirium, 1-year mortality, discharge to assisted care, 30-day readmission, and postoperative complications. Dementia increases the risk of 1-year mortality. Cognitive screening in the preoperative assessment for older surgical patients may be helpful for risk stratification so that appropriate management can be implemented to mitigate adverse postoperative outcomes.",duplicate of 7604,,,

Herein, we aimed to evaluate safety including cognition recovery of RT administered in elderly patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and assess its safety dosage. METHODS: Ninety-nine patients presenting for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were randomized to receive 0.1 mg/kg RT (R1) or 0.2 mg/kg RT (R2), or propofol (P). Cognitive functions (memory, attention, and executive function) were measured via neuropsychological tests conducted before sedation and 5 min after recovery to full alertness. Adverse events were also assessed. RESULTS: There were no statistical differences between postoperative and baseline results for R1 group and P group, whereas those for R2 group revealed worsened postoperative cognitive functions (immediate recall and short delay recall) than baseline (P < 0.05). Compared with P group, Scores demonstrated worse restoration of immediate recall in R1 group, immediate recall, short-delayed recall, and attention function in R2 group (P < 0.05). Patients in R2 group had a longer sedation time (12.09 vs 8.27 vs 8.21 min; P < 0.001) and recovery time (6.85 vs 3.82 vs 4.33 min; P < 0.001) than that in R1 group and P group. Moreover, the incidence of hypotension was 3.0% in R1 group, whereas it was 21.2% in R2 group and 48.5% in P group (P < 0.05).

DESIGN: Open-label randomized trial. SETTING: Single center. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 70 patients older than 75 years without English language limitations and Mini Mental State Examination scores >20. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received either propofol (group P) or dexmedetomidine (group D) postoperatively until normothermic and hemodynamically stable. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Quality of recovery (QoR) was measured by the QoR-40 questionnaire on postoperative day (POD) three. Secondary outcomes were incidence and duration of delirium, time to extubation, length of hospital stay, hospital mortality rate, postoperative quality of life (QoL; measured by SF-36 performed at baseline and six months postoperatively), and neurocognitive disorder (measured by Minnesota Cognitive Acuity Screen [MCAS] performed at baseline, POD5, and six months postoperatively). A total of sixty-seven patients completed the trial. There was no significant difference in QoR-40 scores (95% confidence interval [CI], -7.6081-to-10.9781; p = 1.000), incidence of delirium (group P, 42%; group D, 24%; p = 0.191), mean hospital stay (95% CI, -5.4838-to-1.5444; p = 0.297), mean time to extubation (95% CI, -19.2513-to-7.5561; p = 0.866), or mean duration of delirium (95% CI, -4.3065-to-1.067; p = 0.206) between groups. No patients died in the hospital. There were no significant differences in changes in SF-36 or MCAS scores over time between groups. There was a decline in MCAS score from preoperatively to POD5 in group P (95% CI, -8.95725-to- -2.61775; p = 0.0005), which was greater than that observed in group D. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' findings demonstrated that the use of dexmedetomidine compared with propofol in elderly patients undergoing cardiac surgery was unlikely to improve QoR/postoperative QoL.

BACKGROUND: The development of delirium following hip fracture is common among older patients. According to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 30% of delirium cases are preventable. The prevention of delirium, a multifactorial syndrome, can be achieved through a multicomponent care protocol that targets specific risk factors for delirium. DESIGN: A randomised controlled study was conducted according to the CONSORT 2010 guidelines. The Clinical Trial Registry number is NCT04188795. METHODS: A total of 84 patients were assigned to two groups by block randomisation. The intervention group (n = 41) received nursing care according to a protocol and the control group (n = 43) received standard nursing care. Study data were collected using the demographic information form, the Confusion Assessment Method-Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU), the Barthel Index, the Mini Nutritional Assessment-short form and the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ). The pain of the patients was assessed by using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 80.6 years (standard deviation 8.0; range 65.0- 97.5 years), and the percentage of the male patients were 36.3%. No statistically significant differences were found between the groups in terms of pain and functional status in the preoperative period, on the first postoperative day, or in the predischarge period (p > 0.05 for each). The sleep quality of patients in the intervention group was significantly better than in the control group for all three time measurements (p < 0.05 for each). While 15% of patients in the control group developed delirium, no patient in the intervention group developed delirium (x(2) =6.486, p = 0.026).

C.",Prehabilitative resistance exercise reduces neuroinflammation and improves mitochondrial health in aged mice with perioperative neurocognitive disorders,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction remains a significant problem in vulnerable groups such as the elderly. While experimental data regarding its possible pathogenic mechanisms accumulate, therapeutic options for this disorder are limited. In this study, we evaluated the neuroprotective effect of a period of preconditioning resistant training on aged mice undergoing abdominal surgery. Further, we examined the underlying mechanisms from the perspective of neuroinflammatory state and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. METHODS: 18-month-old C57BL/6N mice were trained for 5 weeks using a ladder-climbing protocol with progressively increasing weight loading. Preoperative baseline body parameters, cognitive performance and neuroinflammatory states were assessed and compared between sedentary and trained groups of 9-month-old and 18-month-old mice. To access the neuroprotective effect of resistance training on postoperative aged mice, both sedentary and trained mice were subjected to a laparotomy under 3% sevoflurane anesthesia. Cognitive performance on postoperative day 14, hippocampal neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction and synaptic plasticity were examined and compared during groups. RESULTS: 18-month-old mice have increased body weight, higher peripheral and central inflammatory status, reduction in muscle strength and cognitive performance compared with middle-aged 9-month-old mice, which were improved by resistance exercise. In the laparotomy group, prehabilitative resistant exercise improved cognitive performance and synaptic plasticity, reduced inflammatory factors and glial cells activation after surgery. Furthermore, resistance exercise activated hippocampal PGC-1α/BDNF/Akt/GSK-3β signaling and improved mitochondrial biogenesis, as well as ameliorated mitochondrial dynamics in postoperative-aged mice. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance exercise reduced risk factors for perioperative neurocognitive disorders such as increased body weight, elevated inflammatory markers, and pre-existing cognitive impairment. Accordantly, preoperative resistance exercise improved surgery-induced adverse effects including cognitive impairment, synaptic deficit and neuroinflammation, possibly by facilitate mitochondrial health through the PGC1-a/BDNF pathway.",duplicate of 8981,,,

DESIGN: In a randomised approach, a delirium prevention and a standard care group were compared regarding manifestation of postoperative cognitive dysfunction at seven days, three and twelve months postoperatively (primary outcome). To correct for practice effects and age-depended cognitive decline, a control group of age-matched healthy subjects was included. SETTING: The trial was conducted at the University Medical Centre Hamburg between 2014 and 2018, data assessment took place in the Anaesthesia Outpatient Clinic and on the surgical ward. PATIENTS: A total of 609 patients ≥60 years scheduled for cardiovascular surgery were enrolled, allocated treatment was received by 284 patients in the delirium prevention and 274 patients in the standard care group. INTERVENTION: The intervention consisted of a delirium prevention bundle including reorientation measures, sleeping aids and early mobilisation. MEASUREMENTS: Cognitive functions were assessed via neuropsychological testing of attention, executive functions including word fluency, and verbal memory utilizing a computerised test of attentional performance, the trail making test, the digit span subtest from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV, the verbal learning and memory test, and the Regensburg Word Fluency Test. Assessments were performed preoperatively and at three time points postoperatively (one week, three months and 12 months). MAIN RESULTS: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction was defined as a clinically meaningful decline in at least two out of nine chosen test parameters compared to the preoperative level (reliable change index ≤ - 1.96). The rates of postoperative cognitive dysfunction were 25.9% (delirium prevention group, n = 284) vs. 28.1% (standard care group, n = 274) [X(2)(1,n = 433) = 0.245;p = 0.621] at postoperative day seven and declined to 7.8% vs. 6.8% [X(2)(1,n = 219) = 0.081;p = 0.775] and 1.3% vs. 5.6% (p = 0.215, Fisher's exact test) at three and 12 months following surgery, respectively. The postoperative delirium rates did not differ between the two groups (delirium prevention group: 13.4% vs. standard care group: 17.3%). Attentional performance was impaired shortly after surgery, whereas verbal delayed recall was most frequently affected over the whole postoperative period. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that an intervention combining specific measures extracted from established postoperative delirium prevention programs did not reduce the rate of postoperative cognitive dysfunction in older adults.",duplicate of 8067,,,

P., Pogliacomi, F., Sabbatini, M.",Delirium risk factors analysis post proximal femur fracture surgery in elderly,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: The increase in the average-age and in the percentage of elderly people implies an exponential increase in fractures of the proximal femur. A common consequence of hip fracture in elderly patients is delirium, characterized by cognitive confusion or a lethargic-type condition. Predisposing factors have been identified, but risk factors assessment useful for managing clinical intervention, has not received unanimous consent. This work aims to identify the potential risk factors for delirium in the elderly operated for hip fracture. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, we included 83 patients aged ≥65 years. Patients undergoing osteosynthesis of the femur and hip replacement for fractures were included. Patients already delusional in the pre-operative period were excluded. At the time, deadlines T0 (pre-operative), and T1,T3,T7 post-operative day, delirium, hematic parameters, blood transfusions, were assessed. RESULTS: Level of delirium was assessed obtaining 80% not delusional and 20% delusional. Glycemia and hemoglobin were not found to be risk factors, although they are known to influence cognitive status; we hypothesize they should be considered predisposing factors. Comorbidities such as atrial fibrillation and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease were found associated with delirium. The most advanced age, anxiolytic drugs, the use of benzodiazepine as anaesthetic, the time surgical waiting, were found significantly associated with delirium. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, findings of this prospective observational study showed that environmental and metabolic risk factors might contribute to make elderly susceptible to develop postoperative delirium following hip surgery.

Frail elderly patients have an increased risk of delirium after elective surgery; however, such an association remains underexplored among trauma patients. AIM: Our goal was to investigate whether preoperative frailty is associated with postoperative delirium (POD) in elderly orthopedic trauma patients. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, retrospective, cross-sectional study. All patients were ≥ 65 years of age and were admitted to the hospital between 01/01/2017 and 08/31/2018 for surgical intervention of a significant extremity fracture. Frailty was assessed using the fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illness, and loss of weight questionnaire. Delirium was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method. POD was defined as new-onset delirium that occurred within 24 h after surgery. To investigate whether frailty is associated with POD, we performed a multiple variable logistic regression, controlling for biologically relevant confounders. RESULTS: Five hundred fifty-six patients comprised the analytic cohort. Incidence of POD was 14% (n = 80). Multiple variable regression analysis demonstrated that each unit increment in FRAIL score was associated with a 33% higher likelihood of POD (OR 1.33; 95% CI 1.02-1.72, p = 0.03).

We aim to assess whether impairment of CVA during major oncologic surgery is associated with delayed neurocognitive recovery (DNCR) postoperatively. We performed a secondary analysis of prospectively collected data. Patients were included if they had undergone complete pre- and postoperative neuropsychological assessments, continuous intraoperative measurement of CVA, and major oncologic surgery for visceral, urological, or gynecological cancer. Intraoperative CVA was measured using the time-correlation method based on near-infrared-spectroscopy, and DNCR was assessed with a neuropsychological test battery. A decline in cognitive function before hospital discharge compared with a preoperative baseline assessment was defined as DNCR. One hundred ninety-five patients were included in the analysis. The median age of the study population was 65 years (IQR: 60-68); 11 patients (5.6%) were female. Forty-one patients (21.0%) fulfilled the criteria for DNCR in the early postoperative period. We found a significant association between impaired intraoperative CVA and DNCR before hospital discharge (OR = 1.042 [95% CI: 1.005; 1.080], p = 0.028). The type of surgery (radical prostatectomy vs. other major oncologic surgery; OR = 0.269 [95% CI: 0.099; 0.728], p = 0.010) and premedication with midazolam (OR = 3.360 [95% CI: 1.039; 10.870], p = 0.043) were significantly associated with the occurrence of DNCR in the early postoperative period. Intraoperative impairment of CVA is associated with postoperative neurocognitive function early after oncologic surgery. Therefore, intraoperative monitoring of CVA may be a target for neuroprotective interventions. The initial studies were retrospectively registered with primary clinical trial registries recognized by the World Health Organization (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: DRKS00010014, 21.03.2016 and NCT04101006, 24.07.2019).",duplicate of 2502,,,

The aim of the current study was to prospectively examine postoperative changes in nutritional and functional status of patients undergoing surgery for gastric, esophageal, and gastroesophageal junction cancer. METHODS: Participants were prospectively recruited from September 2015 to September 2019. The assessment of malnutrition was based on the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment tool. The functional assessment included the evaluation of muscle strength and physical performance, while muscle mass assessment was based on Skeletal Muscle Mass Index (SMI) derived from the analysis of computed tomography scans. The follow up of patients was scheduled at six months postoperatively. RESULTS: A total of 98 patients were analyzed. Mean patient age was 60.79 ± 10.19 years and 80.6% were males. The mean unintentional weight loss at 6 months was 11.7 ± 8.0%. Patients who underwent McKeown esophagectomy reported the greatest weight loss postoperatively (16.2 ± 9.6%), whereas the lowest rate of weight loss was observed in patients who underwent partial gastrectomy (5.6 ± 6.7%). The rate of severe malnutrition declined at six months postoperatively (39.7% vs 27%). Muscle strength and physical performance were significantly deteriorated at 6 months postoperatively, except for the group of partial gastrectomy, while SMI significantly decreased in all groups of patients except for McKewon esophagectomy group. Finally, the prevalence of low muscle mass increased significantly from 43.5% in the preoperative period to 66.7% at the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed a significant deterioration in gastroesophageal cancer patient nutritional and functional status at six months postoperatively.

BACKGROUND: Frailty predicts clinical events in orthopaedic patients aged over 65. However, the strengths and limitations of different approaches to measuring frailty in this population are rarely discussed. As such, a comprehensive review to address the gap is needed. DESIGN: Scoping review using Arksey and O'Malley framework. METHODS: PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus and EMBASE databases were searched to identify studies published from 2006 to 2020 regarding frailty instruments in older orthopaedic patients. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses were followed. RESULTS: The initial search resulted in 1,471 articles. After review against inclusion and exclusion criteria, a final set of 31 articles containing 15 unique frailty instruments were evaluated. Most of the articles were from Western countries. Fried's phenotype and Frailty Index were commonly used. The frailty index was mostly modified to measure frailty. In hip fracture, physical function items were frequently modified in the measurement of frailty. Trained physicians and nurses administered most frailty instruments. Frailty screening was commonly conducted at hospital admission and used to prognosticate both postoperative complications and hospital outcomes. Most instruments could be completed within 10 min. Reported psychometrics had acceptable reliability and validity. CONCLUSION: Many reliable frailty measures have been used in the inpatient orthopaedic settings; however, evidence is still lacking for a gold standard frailty instrument. More research is needed to identify the best-performing measure. Frailty evaluation in patients with physical limitations is challenging with existing instruments. Clinical context, resources required and instrument quality are essential factors in selecting a frailty instrument.

However, after 12 months, 7.9 and 21.2% of patients had clinically significant poorer physical (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores, based on the MCID approach. The results of multivariate analysis identified preoperative health status, age < 70 years, coronary artery bypass grafting, and a previous neurological event as predictors of deterioration in postoperative HRQoL. The greatest risks for deterioration were higher preoperative PCS and MCS scores. CONCLUSION: Although we were able to demonstrate a general improvement in the HRQoL following cardiac surgery, in one-fifth of patients, there was no recovery of mental health status even after 1 year. As this effect is mainly determined by preoperative functional status, HRQoL should be an integral part of medical consultation, especially in younger patients with a positive perception of quality of life.",duplicate of 9763,,,

Sevoflurane is the most widely applied anesthetic in clinical practice. In this study, we investigated the effects of the GLP-1 analogue liraglutide on cognitive function in aged rats anesthetized by sevoflurane. Specifically, 48 Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into the control (C) group, the liraglutide (L) group, the sevoflurane (S) group, and the sevoflurane+liraglutide (SL) group, each group with 12 rats. In the S group and the SL group, the rats were injected subcutaneously with normal saline and liraglutide after inhalation of a mixture of 3% sevoflurane and pure oxygen. In the C group and the L group, normal saline and liraglutide were injected subcutaneously into the rats after inhalation of pure oxygen. Morris Water Maze Task was applied for the detection of spatial learning and memory in rats; HE and TUNEL for staining; and western blot for quantifying Bax, Bcl-2 expression, and examining caspase-3 activity in hippocampal tissues as well as for revealing the antiapoptotic mechanism. Besides, the accumulation of inflammatory factors NF-κB and IL-1β in the hippocampal tissue was quantitatively studied to reveal the anti-inflammatory mechanism. The protective effect of liraglutide on sevoflurane toxicity was the first to be confirmed in this study. Additionally, this study elucidated the mechanism of the above effect. The results of this study might be helpful to find an effective medical solution for the treatment of POCD caused by sevoflurane anesthesia.",duplicate of 6701,,,

DESIGN: Retrospective Observational. SETTING: 40 centers participating in the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group consortium. PATIENTS: Patients ≥65 years of age undergoing non-cardiac, non-vascular surgery who received propofol for general anesthetic induction prior to endotracheal intubation between January 2014 and December 2018. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS: The primary exposure was total propofol induction dose in mg/kg, and the primary outcome was occurrence of severe hypotension (MAP≤55 mmHg) prior to surgical incision, stratified by non-invasive vs. invasive blood pressure monitoring type. MAIN RESULTS: Among 320,585 total patients, 22.6% experienced the outcome of pre-incision severe hypotension (MAP≤55 mmHg). When stratified by blood pressure monitoring type, 20.7% with non-invasive blood pressure measurements, and 35.0% with invasive blood pressure measurements had the outcome. After controlling for a variety of patient and procedural factors, there was a significant independent association between propofol induction dose and pre-incision hypotension (Non-invasive blood pressure cohort odds ratio (OR) 1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 1.13; p < 0.001; and Invasive blood pressure cohort OR 1.15; 95%CI 1.10 to 1.21; adjusted p < 0.001). The association was robust to alternative definitions of the outcome, including less severe hypotension (MAP≤65 mmHg) and blood pressure drop from baseline as a continuous measure. Although no threshold safe induction dose was identified at which hypotension was avoided, an analysis of propofol dose greater or less than 1.5 mg/kg (i.e. the maximum FDA-defined typical induction dose) demonstrated that doses in excess of the FDAs threshold were positively associated with odds of severe hypotension (Non-invasive cohort: OR 1.05; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.08; p < 0.001; Invasive cohort: OR 1.11; 95%CI 1.05 to 1.17; adjusted p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In a multicenter cohort of geriatric surgical patients receiving propofol for general anesthetic induction and endotracheal intubation, severe pre-incision hypotension (MAP ≤55 mmHg) that has previously been associated with postoperative morbidity was common. The dose of propofol used was significantly associated with increased odds of this outcome after controlling for a number of clinically relevant factors.

Furthermore, elderly adults are more susceptible to postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction, which may be exacerbated by both poorly controlled postoperative pain and commonly used pain medications. This narrative review summarizes the literature published in the past 10 years for several nonopioid analgesics commonly prescribed to the geriatric patient in the perioperative period. Nonopioid analgesics are broken down as follows: medications prescribed throughout the perioperative period (acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), medications limited to the acute perioperative setting ( N -methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, dexmedetomidine, dexamethasone, and local anesthetics), and medications to be used with caution in the geriatric patient population (gabapentinoids and muscle relaxants). Our search identified 1757 citations, but only 33 specifically focused on geriatric analgesia. Of these, only 21 were randomized clinical trials' and 1 was a systematic review. While guidance in tailoring pain regimens that focus on the use of nonopioid medications in the geriatric patient is lacking, we summarize the current literature and highlight that some nonopioid medications may extend benefits to the geriatric patient beyond analgesia.",duplicate of 10143,,,

The purpose of this study was to provide a certain preoperative surgical risk assessment tool for super-elderly people. METHODS: We selected 112 individuals who were super-elderly patients aged >90 years who had surgeries under general anesthesia in our department. Based on the quality of the postoperative outcome of each case, we categorized these patients into two groups: good and poor groups. We evaluated the fundamental examination items, such as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, skeletal muscle mass index and so on, and a couple of the well-known risk score systems represented by Estimation of Physiology Ability and Surgical Stress. RESULTS: A total of 85 of the 112 patients belonged to the good group and the rest belonged to the poor group. The quality of postoperative outcome is well characterized by Estimation of Physiology Ability and Surgical Stress (P = 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis of Estimation of Physiology Ability and Surgical Stress for the quality of postoperative outcome shows sensitivity of 0.83 and specificity of 0.61. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that skeletal muscle mass index and American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status are prominent as the risk determinants affecting the quality of postoperative outcome. A scoring system based on the skeletal muscle mass index, which is a good index of sarcopenia, and American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, named the ""SAP score"" has the following characteristics. P-value <0.001, sensitivity 0.76 and specificity 0.91.

This study aimed to explore the effect of ultrasound-guided continuous thoracic paravertebral block (UG-TPVB) on POD in geriatric patients undergoing pulmonary resection. METHODS: Total 128 patients who underwent pulmonary resection were randomly allocated to either the conventional patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) group or the UG-TPVB group (n = 64 per group). The consumption of opioid agents (propofol and remifentanil), postoperative hospital stay, postoperative pulmonary atelectasis, postoperative nausea/vomiting, and postoperative itchiness were recorded. The diagnosis of delirium was dependent on the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale. The postoperative pain was assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS) score. The serum levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α were used to evaluate the postoperative neuroinflammation. RESULTS: The consumption of propofol and remifentanil, postoperative hospital stay, postoperative pulmonary atelectasis, postoperative nausea/vomiting, and postoperative itchiness in the UG-TPVB group were lower than that in the PCA group. Compared with the PCA group, the prevalence of POD was decreased in the UG-TPVB group. In addition, use of UG-TPVB not only reduced postoperative pain (VAS score) but also decreased postoperative neuroinflammation compared with PCA in geriatric patients undergoing pulmonary resection.

Frailty is a risk factor for adverse surgical outcomes, but its relationship with chronic pain after cardiac surgery is unknown. This study aimed to address the association between frailty and chronic pain following cardiac surgery. METHODS: This sub-study of the Anesthesia Geriatric Evaluation study included 518 patients ≥ 70 years undergoing elective cardiac surgery. Pain was evaluated with the Short-Form 36 questionnaire prior to and one year after surgery. Associations between chronic postoperative pain and frailty domains, including medication use, nutritional status, mobility, physical functioning, cognition, HRQL, living situation and educational level, were investigated with multivariable regression analysis. RESULTS: Chronic pain one year after cardiac surgery was reported in 182 patients (35%). Medication use, living situation, mobility, gait speed, Nagi's physical functioning and preoperative HRQL were frailty domains associated with chronic pain after surgery. For patients with chronic pain physical HRQL after one year was worse compared to patients without chronic pain (β -10.37, 99% CI -12.57 - -8.17). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative polypharmacy, living alone, physical frailty and lower mental HRQL are associated with chronic pain following cardiac surgery. Chronic postoperative pain is related to worse physical HRQL one year after cardiac surgery. These findings may guide future preoperative interventions to reduce chronic pain and poor HRQL after cardiac surgery in older patients.

However, the mechanisms of action of dexmedetomidine during the neuroinflammatory response that underlies POCD remain largely unknown. We found that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced substantial inflammatory responses in primary and BV2 microglial cells. The screening of differentially expressed miRNAs revealed that miR-103a-3p was downregulated in these cell culture models. Overexpression of miR-103a-3p mimics and inhibitors suppressed and enhanced the release of inflammatory factors, respectively. VAMP1 expression was upregulated in LPS-treated primary and BV-2 microglial cells, and it was validated as a downstream target of miR-103-3p. VAMP1-knockdown significantly inhibited the LPS-induced inflammatory response. Dexmedetomidine treatment markedly inhibited LPS-induced inflammation and the expression of VAMP1, and miR-103a-3p expression reversed this inhibition. Moreover, dexmedetomidine mitigated microglial activation and the associated inflammatory response in a rat model of surgical trauma that mimicked POCD. In this model, dexmedetomidine reversed miR-103a-3p and VAMP1 expression; this effect was abolished by miR-103a-3p overexpression. Taken together, the data show that miR-103a-3p/VAMP1 is critical for surgery-induced microglial activation of POCD.",duplicate of 6706,,,

We sought to implement a preoperative cognitive impairment and frailty screening programme to meet the unique needs of our rural academic centre. METHODS: Through stakeholder interviews, we identified five primary drivers underlying screening implementation: staff education, technology infrastructure, workload impact, screening value and patient-provider communication. Based on these findings, we implemented cognitive dysfunction (AD8, Mini-Cog) and frailty (Clinical Frailty Scale) screening in our preoperative care clinic and select surgical clinics. RESULTS: In the preoperative care clinic, many of our patients scored positive for clinical frailty (428 of 1231, 35%) and for cognitive impairment (264 of 1781, 14.8%). In our surgical clinics, 27% (35 of 131) and 9% (12 of 131) scored positive for clinical frailty and cognitive impairment, respectively. Compliance to screening improved from 48% to 86% 1 year later.

Despite substantial differences in their construction, these 4 electronic frailty metrics have not been rigorously compared within a surgical population. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the associations between 4 electronic frailty metrics and to measure their predictive value for adverse surgical outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study used electronic health record data from patients who underwent abdominal surgery from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2020, at 20 medical centers within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). Participants included adults older than 50 years who underwent abdominal surgical procedures at KPNC from 2010 to 2020 that were sampled for reporting to the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Pearson correlation coefficients between electronic frailty metrics and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of univariate models and multivariate preoperative risk models for 30-day mortality, readmission, and morbidity, which was defined as a composite of mortality and major postoperative complications. RESULTS: Within the cohort of 37 186 patients, mean (SD) age, 67.9 (female, 19 127 [51.4%]), correlations between pairs of metrics ranged from 0.19 (95% CI, 0.18- 0.20) for mFI-5 and RAI 0.69 (95% CI, 0.68-0.70). Only 1085 of 37 186 (2.9%) were classified as frail based on all 4 metrics.

General anesthesia has already been associated with the one-year post-operative neurocognitive disorder (PostO-NCD), specifically, a deficit in executive function, measured by the Trail Making Test B (TMT-B), but its long-term effects on cognitive function have not been investigated. We aimed to detect preO-NCD prevalence in patients scheduled for cardiac surgery and further investigate the possible role of previous general anesthesia (pGA) in general preoperative cognitive status [measured via the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)] and/or in executive functioning (measured via TMT-B). METHODS: In this observational, prospective study, 151 adult patients scheduled for elective cardiac surgery underwent MoCA and TMT-B. Data on age, education, pGA, comorbidities, and laboratory results were collected. RESULTS: We discovered a general cognitive function impairment of 79.5% and an executive function impairment of 22%. Aging is associated with an increased likelihood (OR 2.99, p = 0.047) and education with a decreased likelihood (OR 0.35, p = 0.0045) of general cognitive impairment, but only education was significantly associated with a decreased likelihood (OR 0.22, p = 0.021) of executive function impairment. While pGA did not significantly affect preO-NCD, a noteworthy interaction between aging and pGA was found, resulting in a synergistic effect, increasing the likelihood of executive function impairment (OR 9.740, p = 0.0174). CONCLUSION: We found a high prevalence of preO-NCD in patients scheduled for cardiac surgery. General cognitive function impairment is highly associated with advancing age (not pGA). However, older patients with at least one pGA appeared to be at an increased risk of preO-NCD, especially executive function impairment, suggesting that TMT-B should be associated with MoCA in the preoperative cognitive evaluation in this population.",duplicate of 10855,,,

The primary exposure was smoking status (n = 43, 10%). Additional risk factors included demographics, injury characteristics, and medical interventions. Delirium (primary) and analgesia-related complications were examined with multivariable logistic regression, while analysis of covariance models were used to examine preoperative and postoperative pain scores and opioid consumption (oral morphine equivalents). RESULTS: Smokers had significantly worse outcomes compared with nonsmokers: delirium incidence was 16.3% versus 5.0% (adjusted odds ratio, 4.23; P = 0.005), analgesia complications developed in 30.2% versus 14.8% (adjusted odds ratio, 2.63; P = 0.01), and postoperative opioid consumption was greater (53 mg versus 33 mg, adjusted P = 0.04).

STUDY DESIGN: Case series with planned data collection. SETTING: Two tertiary care academic hospitals. METHODS: The VESPA was administered prospectively in the preoperative setting. Data on patient demographics, ablative and reconstructive procedures, and outcomes including total length of stay, discharge disposition, delay in discharge, or complex discharge planning (delay or change in disposition) were collected via retrospective chart review. VESPA scores were calculated and risk categories were used to estimate risk of adverse postoperative outcomes using multivariate logistic regression for categorical outcomes and linear regression for continuous variables. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients met study inclusion criteria. The mean (SD) age was 66.4 (11.9) years, and 58.4% of patients were male. Nearly one-fourth described preoperative difficulty in either a basic or instrumental activity of daily living, and 17% were classified as low functional status (ie, high risk) according to the VESPA. Low functional status did not independently predict length of stay but was associated with delayed discharge (odds ratio [OR], 5.0; 95% CI, 1.2-21.3; P = .030) and complex discharge planning (OR, 5.7; 95% CI, 1.34-24.2; P = .018).

Here, we investigate the hypothesis that this association varies on the basis of the degree of a patient's frailty. METHODS: Frailty was assessed using the Memorial Sloan Kettering Frailty Index. Our hypothesis was evaluated using two approaches, both adjusted for age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status, preoperative albumin, operating room duration, and estimated blood loss. A logistic regression was performed with 90-day mortality as the outcome and geriatric comanagement, continuous Memorial Sloan Kettering Frailty Index, and an interaction term between these two variables as the primary predictors. We then categorized frailty into four levels and, within each level, performed logistic regression with geriatric comanagement as the primary predictor and 90-day mortality as the outcome. Finally, we extracted the effect size and used a meta-analytic approach to test for heterogeneity. RESULTS: Of 1687 patients aged ≥75 years who underwent elective cancer surgery with a length of stay of ≥1 day, 931 (55%) received comanagement; 31 patients (3.3%) who received comanagement died within 90 days, compared with 72 (9.5%) who did not. Ninety-day mortality was not statistically significantly different by degree of frailty in either analysis (interaction P = 0.4; test of heterogeneity P = 0.8). CONCLUSION: Geriatric comanagement is valuable for all older surgical patients, not just the frail, and should be provided to as large a portion of the older surgical population as possible. Further research should examine predictors of response to geriatric comanagement.",duplicate of 6759,,,

Cognitive status is important for operative management, especially in elderly populations. This study aims to investigate preoperative and postoperative cognitive function assessment tools in geriatric patients following acute trauma and associated outcomes, including functional status, postdischarge disposition, mortality, and hospital length of stay (H-LOS). METHODS: A literature search was conducted using Medline/PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, JAMA Networks, and Cochrane databases for studies investigating the use of cognitive assessment tools for geriatric patients with acute trauma. The last literature search was conducted on November 13, 2021. RESULTS: Ten studies were included in this review, of which five focused on preoperative cognitive assessment and five focused on postoperative. The evidence suggests patients with preoperative cognitive impairment had worse functional status, mortality, and postdischarge disposition along with increased LOS. Acute trauma patients with postoperative cognitive impairment also had worse functional status, mortality, and adverse postdischarge disposition. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative and postoperative cognitive impairment is common in geriatric patients with acute trauma and is associated with worse outcomes, including decreased functional status, increased LOS, and adverse discharge disposition. Cognitive assessment tools such as MMSE, MoCA, and CAM are fast and effective at detecting cognitive impairment in the acute trauma setting and allow clinicians to address preoperative or postoperative cognitive impairments to improve patient outcomes.",duplicate of 7000,,,

G.",The Perioperative Use of Benzodiazepines for Major Orthopedic Surgery in the United States,"BACKGROUND: Despite numerous indications for perioperative benzodiazepine use, associated risks may be exacerbated in elderly and comorbid patients. In the absence of national utilization data, we aimed to describe utilization patterns using national claims data from total hip/knee arthroplasty patients (THA/TKA), an increasingly older and vulnerable surgical population. METHODS: We included data on 1,863,996 TKAs and 985,471 THAs (Premier Healthcare claims data, 2006-2019). Benzodiazepine utilization (stratified by long- and short-acting agents) was assessed by patient- and health care characteristics, and analgesic regimens. Given the large sample size, standardized differences instead of P values were utilized to signify meaningful differences between groups (defined by value >0.1). RESULTS: Among 1,863,996 TKA and 985,471 THA patients, the utilization rate of benzodiazepines was 80.5% and 76.1%, respectively. In TKA, 72.6% received short-acting benzodiazepines, while 7.9% received long-acting benzodiazepines, utilization rates 68.4% and 7.7% in THA, respectively. Benzodiazepine use was particularly more frequent among younger patients (median age [interquartile range {IQR}]: 66 [60-73]/64 [57-71] among short/long-acting compared to 69 [61-76] among nonusers), White patients (80.6%/85.4% short/long-acting versus 75.7% among nonusers), commercial insurance (36.5%/34.0% short/long-acting versus 29.1% among nonusers), patients receiving neuraxial anesthesia (56.9%/56.5% short/long-acting versus 51.5% among nonusers), small- and medium-sized (≤500 beds) hospitals (68.5% in nonusers, and 74% and 76.7% in short- and long-acting benzodiazepines), and those in the Midwest (24.6%/25.4% short/long-acting versus 16% among nonusers) in TKA; all standardized differences ≥0.1. Similar patterns were observed in THA except for race and comorbidity burden. Notably, among patients with benzodiazepine use, in-hospital postoperative opioid administration (measured in oral morphine equivalents [OMEs]) was substantially higher. This was even more pronounced in patients who received long-acting agents (median OME with no benzodiazepines utilization 192 [IQR, 83-345] vs 256 [IQR, 153-431] with short-acting, and 329 [IQR, 195-540] with long-acting benzodiazepine administration). Benzodiazepine use was also more frequent in patients receiving multimodal analgesia (concurrently 2 or more analgesic modes) and regional anesthesia. Trend analysis showed a persistent high utilization rate of benzodiazepines over the last 14 years. CONCLUSIONS: Based on a representative sample, 4 of 5 patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery in the United States receive benzodiazepines perioperatively, despite concerns for delirium and delayed postoperative neurocognitive recovery. Notably, benzodiazepine utilization was coupled with substantially increased opioid use, which may project implications for perioperative pain management.",duplicate of 9034,,,

Our objective was to evaluate the association between preoperative frailty and postoperative disability. METHODS: Patients were prospectively evaluated using the Comprehensive Assessment of Frailty score, separating patients into frail and non-frail cohorts. Disability levels were quantified using the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) 2.0 in percentage of the maximum disability score, with disability defined as a value ≥25%. RESULTS: Frail patients had increased median [inter-quartile range] disability scores of 31 [16-45]% preoperatively, 29 [9-54]% at 1 month, and 15 [3-31]% at 3 months postoperatively, compared with disability scores in non-frail patients of 10 [5-17]%, 17 [6-29]%, and 2.1 [0-12.0]%, respectively. Preoperative frailty was associated with a reduced likelihood of patients being free of disability and alive at 3 months; adjusted odds ratio 0.51 (for age, European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II, and WHODAS 2.0: 12-Part Questionnaire score); P=0.045. The trajectory of disability scores, assessed in percentage change from the preoperative baseline, showed non-frail patients had increased disability burden at 1 month, whereas frail patients had reduced disability burden (+4.2% vs -2.1%; P=0.04). Although the disability burden decreased for both groups at 3 months, this was most marked for frail patients (-6.3% vs -10.4%; P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Disability burden in frail patients improves continuously postoperatively, whereas in non-frail patients, it worsens at 1 month before improving at 3 months postoperatively.

However, evidence for this is lacking. AIM: To evaluate the effect of anesthesia on postoperative complications in older patients undergoing hip surgery. METHODS: This is a retrospective, propensity score-matched, cohort study. Patients ≥ 65-years-old who underwent hip surgery at the Traditional Chinese Medicine of Guangdong Provincial Hospital in China from October 2016 to June 2020 were included. The operative methods were femoral fracture's internal fixation and hip replacement. The orthopedic doctors in different hospitals of our group have varied requirements for patients' out-of-bed time after surgery. Therefore, spinal anesthesia or general anesthesia was selected according to the requirements of the orthopedic doctors. The primary outcome of this study was complications during the hospitalization of the postoperative patient. The length of hospital stay, postoperative blood transfusion, routine blood analysis, renal function, coagulation function, and inflammatory correlations were secondary outcomes. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed utilizing logistic regression. RESULTS: Among the 864 patients identified from the electronic medical record data database, we screened out those with incomplete medical record data. After PSM of the baseline values of the two groups of patients, data of 309 patients (206 patients in spinal anesthesia group and 103 patients in general anesthesia) were utilized in this study. 67/309 patients had complications, including postoperative limb dysfunction, pulmonary infection, delirium, lower extremity venous thrombosis, and shock. The incidence of complications was not related to anesthesia methods (P > 0.05), but the levels of D-Dimer (P = 0.017), fibrinogen (P = 0.005), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) (P = 0.002) in the spinal anesthesia group were significantly higher than those in the general anesthesia group. CONCLUSION: Anesthesia technology is not a risk factor for postoperative complications of hip surgery. The levels of D-Dimer and hsCRP were higher in the spinal anesthesia group.",duplicate of 11279,,,

METHODS: This prospective study enrolled hip fracture patients aged ≥60 years who were admitted into our hospital between July 2011 and August 2019. Hip fractures were classified according to the Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteo-synthesefragen (AO) classification. This study included patients with isolated hip fracture and excluded patients with pathological or peri prosthetic fracture or patients with multiple traumatic injuries and high-energy trauma. They were randomized to receive conventional orthopedic care group (n = 65) or comprehensive orthopedic care group including preoperative psychological counseling and preventative risperidone (n = 63). Daily assessment was based on patient interview with the CAM-CR, and delirium was diagnosed by the Delirium Rating Scale (DRS-R-98). The rate, severity and duration of perioperative delirium and the length of postoperative stay were analyzed. RESULTS: Totally 200 patients were screened for eligibility. Twenty patients were excluded due to alcohol abuse and 40 were excluded because of brain lesions on head CT. In addition, 12 patients were excluded because of impaired cognition. Finally 128 patients were enrolled. Their mean age was 75.3 ± 2.2 years for the comprehensive orthopedic care group and 73.5 ± 6.1 years for the conventional orthopedic care group, and 53.9% of the patients were female. Sixty-eight (53.1%) patients had intertrochanteric fracture, 39.8% patients had femoral head fracture, and 7.0% patients had subtrochanteric fracture. In addition, 58.6% patients underwent internal fixation and 41.4% patients received arthroplasty. In this study, 63 patients were randomized to the comprehensive orthopedic care group and 65 patients to the conventional orthopedic care group. The two groups were comparable in demographic and baseline characteristics (P > 0.05). The rate of perioperative delirium was significantly lower in the comprehensive care group vs the conventional care group (15.9% vs. 30.8%; P < 0.05).

Best practice recommends assessing surgical patients for delirium risk factors and this includes screening for cognitive impairment. The Mini-Cog© is a short instrument which has been shown to predict postoperative delirium (POD) and other complications in elderly patients undergoing major elective surgery. The primary aim of this study was to ascertain whether a positive preoperative Mini-Cog© is associated with postoperative delirium in elective colorectal surgery patients at high-risk of mortality due to age or comorbidity. Secondary outcomes were 90-day mortality and length of stay. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of data gathered prospectively between October 2015 and December 2017. Baseline data were collected at a preoperative screening clinic, and postoperative data during daily ward rounds by the Perioperative Medicine team at The York Hospital. RESULTS: Three hundred nineteen patients were included in the final analysis, of which 52 (16%) were found to be cognitively impaired on the Mini-Cog©. Older patients (median difference 10 years, p < 0.001) and patients with cognitive impairment (OR 3.04, 95%CI 1.15 to 8.03, p = 0.019) were more likely to develop postoperative delirium in univariate analysis; however, cognitive impairment (OR 0.492, 95%CI 0.177 to 1.368, p = 0.174) loses its significance when controlled for by confounding factors in a logistic regression model. Cognitive impairment (OR 4.65, 95%CI 1.36 to 15.9, p = 0.02), frailty (OR 7.28, 95%CI 1.92 to 27.58, p = 0.009), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade (OR 5.95, 95%CI 1.54 to 22.94, p = 0.006) and age (median difference 10 years, p = 0.002) were significantly associated with 90-day mortality in univariate analysis.

Platelet count has been proved to be an essential factor in inflammation. However, as far as we know, the relationship between platelet count and PND is not clear yet in the orthopedic area. PND could be a long-term disease, which sometimes lasts for several years, and it is meaningful to find a biomarker of PND at the early stage. Thus, we designed this study to find out the association between perioperative platelet count and occurrence of PND, and determine whether preoperative platelet count could be a biomarker of the early stage of PND. METHODS: A prospective observational study was performed on the patients who would take total knee arthroplasty or total hip arthroplasty. Their peripheral platelets were counted by blood routine examination 1 day before and 3 days after the surgery. And we assessed their neurocognitive functions 1 day before and 3 days after the surgery. These data were recorded and analyzed to find out the relationship between platelet count and the occurrence of PND. RESULTS: Eventually, 70 patients finished the whole process, and 14 of them developed PND. The median preoperative platelet count in the PND group was significantly higher than that in the non-PND group (239 vs 168 × 10^9/L, p = 0.009). Preoperative platelet count was an independent risk factor for PND (odds ratio = 1.014, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.000-1.027, P = 0.043) in the logistic multivariable regression, while the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve of the prediction model was 0.796 (95% CI 0.676-0.916). CONCLUSIONS: The higher preoperative and postoperative level of platelet count in the peripheral blood were associated with the early stage of PND, and preoperative platelet count could be a potential predictor of the early stage of PND in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgeries.

Our objective is to systematically review the association of frailty with postoperative mortality and other adverse outcomes in adult patients who have undergone nonemergency cancer surgery. METHODS: After registration (CRD42020171163), we systematically reviewed PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases to identify all studies reporting an association between a preoperative frailty measurement and a relevant outcome (primary: all-cause mortality in-hospital or within 30 days of surgery; secondary outcomes: postoperative complications, length of stay, discharge disposition, mortality between 30 days and 1 year, postoperative function, and delirium). All stages of the review were completed in duplicate. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality in Prognostic Studies (QUIPS) tool. Metaanalysis was used to pool effect estimates using random-effects models. RESULTS: A total of 2877 studies were identified, and 71 were included.

METHODS: The Risk Analysis Index measuring frailty was prospectively administered to patients undergoing curative parathyroid exploration or total thyroidectomy. Risk Analysis Index results at the preoperative, postoperative, and last follow-up visits were assessed longitudinally. RESULTS: Compared to total thyroidectomy patients (n = 142), parathyroid exploration patients (n = 187) were older (P = .001), more often male (P = .05) and had longer surgical follow-up (P < .001). Mean preoperative Risk Analysis Index scores were higher in parathyroid exploration patients (24 ± 9 vs total thyroidectomy 17 ± 8, P < .001). Parathyroid exploration patients demonstrated a significant decrease in Risk Analysis Index score from preoperative to last follow-up (P < .01); total thyroidectomy patients did not (P = .44). Parathyroid exploration patients were also less likely to exhibit a 20% increase in Risk Analysis Index over time, suggesting that parathyroidectomy slowed progression of frailty (2% vs 19%, P = .003).

We retrospectively analyzed 9015 patients aged 65 years and older who underwent cancer resection at a single tertiary hospital. Based on electronic-medical-record data regarding preoperative blood test results and vital signs, Laboratory Frailty Index (FI-Lab) scores were generated to measure preoperative frailty. The associations of FI-Lab with postoperative length of stay (LOS), readmission within 30 days, intensive care unit (ICU) admission within 30 days, and mortality were evaluated. The mean FI-Lab score of the 9015 patients was 0.20 ± 0.10. Increased FI-Lab scores (0.25-0.4; > 0.4) were associated with longer LOS, increased readmission within 30 days of surgery, ICU admission, and increased mortality, compared with FI-Lab scores < 0.25.

The modified National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (mNIHSS) is validated for use in nonsurgical strokes but is not well-studied in surgical patients. We evaluated perioperative changes in the mNIHSS score in noncardiac, non-neurological surgery patients, feasibility in the perioperative setting, and the relationship between baseline cognitive screening and change in mNIHSS score. METHODS: Patients aged 65 years and above presenting for noncardiac, non-neurological surgery were prospectively recruited. Those with significant preoperative cognitive impairment (Montreal Cognitive Assessment score [MoCA] ≤17) were excluded. mNIHSS was assessed preoperatively, on postoperative day (POD) 0, POD 1, and POD 2, demographic data collected, and feedback solicited from participants. Changes in mNIHSS from baseline, time to completion, and relationship between baseline MoCA score and change in mNIHSS score were analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were enrolled into the study; no overt strokes occurred. Median mNIHSS score increased between baseline (0 interquartile range [IQR 0 to 1]) and POD 0 (2 [IQR 0 to 3.5]; P<0.001) but not between baseline and POD 1 (0.5 [IQR 0 to 1.5]; P=0.174) or POD 2 (0 [IQR 0 to 1]; P=0.650). Time to complete the mNIHSS at baseline was 3.5 minutes (SD 0.8), increasing to 4.1 minutes (SD 1.0) on POD 0 (P=0.0249). Baseline MoCA score was correlated with mNIHSS score change (P=0.038). Perioperative administration of the mNIHSS was feasible, and acceptable to patients. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in mNIHSS score can occur early after surgery in the absence of overt stroke. Assessment of mNIHSS appears feasible in the perioperative setting, although further research is required to define its role in detecting perioperative stroke.",duplicate of 5814,,,

Opioids are associated with adverse effects in this population, so oral acetaminophen is commonly prescribed to minimize opioid use. Intravenous (iv) acetaminophen has been reported to have superior efficacy and bioavailability than oral acetaminophen. Nevertheless, its effect on postoperative outcomes in emergency hip fractures is unclear. This systematic review assessed the effect of iv acetaminophen on postoperative outcomes in older hip fracture patients. SOURCE: We searched multiple databases from inception to June 2021 for studies on adults > 50 yr of age undergoing emergency hip fracture surgery who received iv acetaminophen (or paracetamol) and that reported postoperative outcomes. Relevant titles, abstracts, and full texts were screened based on the eligibility criteria. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the quality of the selected papers. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Of 3,510 initial studies, four met the inclusion criteria. One was a prospective cohort study and three were retrospective cohort studies. All four studies used historical control groups. Three studies reported a significantly lower mean opioid dose with iv acetaminophen than with oral acetaminophen. Three studies also reported a significantly shorter hospital stay. One study each reported a significant decrease in the number of missed physical therapy sessions, the need for one-to-one supervision, and episodes of delirium. CONCLUSION: There is very limited low-level evidence that iv acetaminophen improves preoperative and postoperative analgesia and shortens hospital stay in older hip fracture patients. Nevertheless, our results should be interpreted with caution since there are no prospective randomized trials investigating whether iv acetaminophen improves postoperative outcomes in this patient population.

We assessed whether preoperative GNRI was associated with 30-day complications after radical cystectomy (RC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database, we identified patients 65 years or older who underwent RC for the treatment of bladder cancer between 2007 and 2019. Patients were dichotomized into at-risk (GNRI ≤98) or no-risk (GNRI >98) groups. Using propensity score matching, the 2 groups were compared for baseline differences and 30-day outcomes. We evaluated GNRI as an independent predictor of postoperative complications using multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: We identified 2,926 patients eligible for analysis. After propensity score matching, patients in the at-risk GNRI group had higher rates of any complication (p=0.017), blood transfusion (p=0.002), extended length of stay (p=0.004) and nonhome discharge (p <0.001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that a decreasing GNRI is an independent prognostic factor for mortality (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.08, p=0.009), blood transfusion (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02-1.04, p <0.001), pneumonia (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.07, p=0.013), extended length of stay (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02-1.05, p <0.001) and nonhome discharge (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.03-1.06, p <0.001).

This study aimed to establish the potential risk factors for POD. METHODS: In total, 336 patients who underwent elective TJA under general anesthesia between 2018 and 2021 were included and deemed eligible for inclusion. POD was diagnosed based on the criteria by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM V). The receiver operating characteristic curve was drawn to evaluate the predictive and cut-off values of continuous variables for POD. Potential risk factors for POD were evaluated by binary univariate and multivariate analysis with the ""Enter"" method. RESULTS: According to the criteria by DSM V, 43 patients were categorized into the POD group, with an incidence of 12.8% (43 of 336). The receiver operating characteristic curve showed that albumin/fibrinogen ratio (AFR) was a good predictor for POD with an area under the curve of 0.754, cut-off value of 9.65, sensitivity of 57.00% and specificity of 83.72% (P <0.001). A low preoperative AFR level (<9.65) was determined as the only independent risk factor for POD by the univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses (OR: 2.45, 95% CI: 2.01-2.94, P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that a low AFR is an independent risk factor for POD in elderly subjects after TJA. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2022; 22: 412-417.",duplicate of 8903,,,

M., Bhargavan, R. V., Augustine, P., Thomas, S.",Comparison of preoperative assessment tools in older patients undergoing cancer surgery: A prospective study,"INTRODUCTION: Surgery in older adults with cancer is complex due to multiple age related confounding factors. There are many scoring systems available for preoperative risk stratifications of older patients. Currently very few prospective studies comparing the various commonly used scales are available. This is the first study which compares the established preoperative risk assessment tools of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Scale (ECOG) and American Society of Anaesthesiologists Physical Status Scale (ASA) with frailty scores of Modified Frailty Index (MFI) and Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a prospective observational study of older patients with cancer who underwent oncosurgery in a tertiary cancer centre during the one-year study period. Patients were scored on the CFS, MFI, ASA and ECOG scales. All patients were followed up for 30 days immediately following surgery and their post operative complications were documented. Univariate and multivariate analyses were done and a p value of ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Of the 820 patients studied, 15.6% had prolonged hospital stay, 9.1% had 30-day morbidity, 0.7% had readmission, and mortality was 1.1%. High-risk scores on the ASA and CFS were significantly associated with prolonged postoperative stay, readmission, morbidity, and mortality (p < 0.05). High-risk scores on the ECOG was significantly associated with prolonged hospital stay (p = 0.027), 30-day morbidity (p = 0.003), and mortality (p = 0.001), but not with readmission. There was no significant association between MFI score and the postoperative variables studied (p > 0.05). On multivariate analysis, morbidity was significantly associated only with male gender (p = 0.015), higher cancer stage (p = 0.005), higher ASA score (p = 0.029), and prolonged hospital stay (p = 0.001). Mortality was significantly associated only with emergency surgery (p = 0.012) and prolonged hospital stay (p = 0.004), and prolonged hospital stay was significantly associated with advanced cancer stage (p = 0.001) and emergency surgery (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In older patients undergoing cancer surgery, ASA and CFS are predictors of prolonged postoperative stay, morbidity, mortality, and readmission. A high-risk ECOG score is predictive of prolonged post operative stay, 30-day morbidity, and mortality, but not of readmission. Score on MFI is not a predictor of postoperative outcomes. Newer predictive tools which include cancer- specific factors are required for better management of these patients.",duplicate of 6818,,,

M., Tennant, A., Waldron, A., Bashir, N.",Comprehensive geriatric assessment: outcomes of an advanced nurse practitioner-led service for older people requiring emergency surgery,"A comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is a holistic multidimensional review of older people living with frailty or at risk of frailty. In emergency surgical settings, CGAs can be used to identify medical issues and geriatric syndromes among older patients and consequently try to improve their post-operative outcomes. However, there is a lack of geriatrician input in hospitals beyond medical wards, which means that older people who need emergency surgery do not always undergo a CGA, with potential negative repercussions for their post-operative outcomes. One solution to this issue is to employ advanced nurse practitioners (ANPs) to deliver equivalent services. This article presents and discusses the results of an audit of an ANP-led CGA service for older people admitted to hospital for emergency surgery. The ANP reviewed 147 patients during the audit period and identified frailty in 37% and new medical issues in 89% of patients. Interventions initiated by the ANP based on the CGA included requests for additional investigations, referral to allied health professionals and discharge planning. The audit results suggest that ANPs can conduct CGAs in emergency surgical settings effectively.",duplicate of 7110,,,

METHODS: Adult patients undergoing pancreatic resection from 2019-2021 were enrolled in a pilot prehabilitation program. Three validated measures of physical status were used: the 6-minute walk test, grip strength, and chair-stand test. The prehabilitation program comprised 7,500 steps, 30 grip strength exercises, and 100 chair-stand exercises daily. Patients' frailty score was calculated using the Modified Johns Hopkins Frailty score. Changes in physical status measures after prehabilitation and postoperative outcomes were compared. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients with a median age of 69.0 years (interquartile range = 59.5-76.3 years) were included. Patients' median duration of participation was 21.5 days (interquartile range = 16-29 days). There was a negative correlation between increasing frailty score and baseline the 6-minute walk test (R(2) = 0.17) and chair-stand test (R(2) = 0.18). Patients' mean the 6-minute walk test decreased at the end of the prehabilitation program, while grip strength and chair-stand test were unchanged. When stratified by low or intermediate and high frailty scores, the differences in the 6-minute walk test and chair-stand test were unchanged. Hospital duration of stay, complications, and 90-day readmission rates were not different between frailty groups (P > .05). CONCLUSION: Correlation of physical status measures with frailty score suggests only one of these measures is sufficient to estimate patients' preoperative physical status. A longer, more comprehensive prehabilitation program or an expedited operation are likely the best strategies to improve patient outcomes.",duplicate of 7351,,,

METHODS: Data of patients aged 18 years and older who were diagnosed with subarachnoid hemorrhage or intracerebral hemorrhage, underwent aneurysm repair surgical intervention from 2005 to 2014. A retrospective database analysis was performed based on U.S. National Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 2005 to 2014. Frailty was determined using the Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups (ACG) frailty-defining diagnoses indicator. Patients were stratified into frail and non-frail groups and the study endpoints were incidence of postoperative complications and related adverse clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Among 20,527 included aSAH patients, 2303 (11.2%) were frail and 18,224 (88.8%) were non-frail. Significant differences were found between frailty and non-frailty groups in the four clinical outcomes (all p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that frailty was associated with significant higher risks of discharge to institutional care (aOR: 2.50, 95%CI: 2.10-2.97), tracheostomy or gastrostomy tube replacement (aOR: 4.41, 95%CI: 3.81-5.10) and postoperative complications (aOR: 3.29, 95%CI: 2.55-4.25) but a lower risk of death in hospital (aOR: 0.40, 95%CI: 0.33-0.49) as compared with non-frailty. Stratified analysis showed the impact of frailty on some of the outcomes were greater among patients younger than 65 years than their older counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is significantly correlated with the increased risk of discharge to institutional care, tracheostomy or gastrostomy tube placement, and postoperative complications but with the reduced risk of in-hospital mortality outcomes after aneurysm repair. Frailty seems to have greater impact among younger adults than older ones. Baseline frailty evaluation could be applied to risk stratification for aSAH patients who were undergoing surgery.",duplicate of 7355,,,

Our objective was to evaluate these outcomes after suprapubic tube (SPT) placement. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, cohort study in the nursing home setting. Participants were long-term nursing home residents who underwent SPT placement from 2014 to 2016 in the United States. SPT placements were identified in Medicare Inpatient, Outpatient, and Carrier files using International Classification of Diseases and Current Procedural Terminology codes. Residents were identified through the Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0 for Nursing Home Residents. MDS Activities of Daily Living (MDS-ADL) and Brief Interview for Mental Status (BIMS) scores were used to assess function and cognition, respectively. Outcomes of interest were worsening MDS-ADL and BIMS scores at 1 year postoperatively, 30-day postoperative complications, and 1-year mortality. Functional and cognitive trajectories were modeled to 1 year postoperatively using mixed-effect spline models. RESULTS: From 2014 to 2016, 9647 residents with a mean age of 80.9 (SD 8.1) years underwent SPT placement. At 1 year postoperatively, 37.6% of residents died, while of survivors, 33.7% had worsening MDS-ADL and 36.2% worsened BIMS. Residents had steeper postoperative rates of functional decline compared to relatively stable preoperative trends that never recovered to baseline status. However, robustly characterizing an association between SPT placement and functional decline would require a propensity score matched cohort without SPT placement. Decline in cognitive status was not clearly associated with SPT placement, suggesting either the natural course of a vulnerable population or limitations of BIMS scores. CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes important to older adults, such as functional ability and cognitive status, do not show improvement after SPT placement. These findings emphasize that this ""minor"" procedure should be considered with caution in this population and primarily for palliation.",duplicate of 16348,,,

In the DEXACET trial, we demonstrated a significant reduction in postoperative in-hospital delirium with intravenous (IV) acetaminophen when compared with placebo. In this analysis we examined whether this protective association also extended to 12 month cognitive and functional outcomes. Methods: This study was a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, triple-blinded, factorial design trial conducted at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, approved by the IRB. In this trial, 120 older cardiac surgical patients were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous (IV) acetaminophen or placebo in addition to propofol or dexmedetomidine. Those receiving IV acetaminophen displayed a significant reduction in in-hospital delirium. We collected cognitive, mood and functional outcome data using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, telephone version (T-MoCA), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the Basic and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADLs, IADLs) at 1 month and 12 months after surgery. Results: Of the 120 enrolled patients in the primary trial, 93 (77.5%) and 83 (69.2%) patients responded to assessments at 1 month and 12 months, respectively. No statistically significant differences in median T-MoCA scores were observed between acetaminophen and placebo groups at 1 month (18.0 vs.18.0, p = 0.52) or 12 months (19.0 vs.18.0, p = 0.62) following surgery. There were similarly no differences in GDS, ADLs or IADLs between treatment groups. Losses to follow-up limited the sample sizes and 10 of the 23 (45%) original study participants who had postoperative delirium were lost to follow up. Conclusion: Administration of intravenous acetaminophen was not associated with a difference in long term cognitive or functional status following cardiac surgery. Additional research on long-term outcomes following postoperative delirium with a larger sample size and improved cohort retention strategies will be needed to address this important area.",duplicate of 11511,,,

The strongest evidence was found between 30-day mortality and frailty. Composite 30-day morbidity and mortality, functional status at discharge, length of stay, spinal cord deficit, and access site complications were found to be nonsignificantly associated with frailty.

METHODS: 255 elderly patients (≥ 65 years) undergoing major surgery (planned surgical time > 60 min) in a tertiary hospital were compared to 76 non-surgical controls from general practice. Patients were assessed twice daily for postoperative delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM(-ICU)), nursing delirium screening scale (NuDESC) and validated chart review. Before surgery and 3 and 12 months thereafter, the participants filled in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) and the Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome-14-Questions Inventory (PTSS-14). Non-surgical controls filled in the same questionnaires with similar follow-up. RESULTS: Patients were more often male, had higher American Society of Anesthesiologists scores and more often had a spouse compared to controls (p < 0.005). Forty-three patients (18%) developed postoperative delirium, who were significantly older, had higher ASA scores and lower estimated IQ scores compared to the patients who did not develop delirium (p < 0.05).

METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 435 patients aged more than 60 years who underwent elective proximal aortic surgery, defined as surgery on the aortic root, ascending aorta, or aortic arch through median sternotomy. Patients completed a 5-m gait speed test within 30 days before surgery. We evaluated the association between categoric (slow, ≤0.83 m/s and normal, >0.83 m/s) and continuous gait speed and the likelihood of experiencing the composite outcome before and after adjustment for European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II. The composite outcome included in-hospital mortality, renal failure, prolonged ventilation, and discharge location. Secondary outcomes were 1-year mortality and 5-year survival. RESULTS: Of the study population, 30.3% (132/435) were categorized as slow. Slow walkers were significantly more likely to have in-hospital mortality, prolonged ventilation, and renal failure, and were less likely to be discharged home (all P < .05). The composite outcome was 2 times more likely to occur for slow walkers (gait speed categoric adjusted odds ratio, 2.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.27-3.40; P = .004). Moreover, a unit (1 m/s) increase in gait speed (continuous) was associated with 73% lower risk of experiencing the composite outcome (odds ratio, 0.27; 95% confidence interval, 0.11-0.68; P = .006).

DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: A tertiary hospital affiliated to a medical university. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: We retrospectively studied 1285 surgical-treated geriatric patients with a hip fracture from April 2010 to April 2018. INTERVENTION: Surgical treatment was performed on the patients of this study. The procedure methods were classified as: total hip arthroplasty, hemiarthroplasty, percutaneous fixation, intramedullary nail fixation, and plate/screw fixation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENT: The primary interest of end point of this study is the development of POP during the postoperative period. The postoperative period in this study was defined as the time from 24 hours after surgery to discharge. The diagnostic criteria for pneumonia were set according to the guidelines built by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society (Guidelines for the Management of Adults with Hospital-Acquired, Ventilator-Associated, and Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia, 2005). Potential variables for developing POP were identified using logistic regression analyses initially and were further selected via the method of LASSO. Then the independent risk factors were identified by multivariable regression analyses. A predictive nomogram was built based on the multiple regression model, and the calibration abilities of the nomogram was measured by Harrel C-index, calibration plot and Hosmer-Lemeshow test, respectively. Decision curve analysis was carried out to assess the net benefit due to threshold probability and an on-line questionnaire survey was conducted among the clinicians to assess the applicability of the nomogram coherently. RESULTS: Of the 1285 patients, 70 (5.4%) developed POP. COPD, number of comorbidities, ASA classification >2, preoperative dependent functional status and cognitive impairment were identified as independent risk factors of POP. The nomogram built based on the results showed good accordance between the predicted probabilities and the observed frequency. The decision curve analysis confirmed the clinical utility of the nomogram when the threshold probabilities were between 5% and 65% due to the net benefit, while the results of on-line questionnaire among 200 clinicians showed that 91.5% of the participants had a mental threshold of intervention between 5-50%. CONCLUSION: (1). COPD, number of comorbidities, ASA classification >2, preoperative dependent functional status and cognitive impairment are independent risk factors for POP. (2). The nomogram built in this study has a good accordance between the predictive risk and the observational incidence. The results of decision curve and questionnaire among clinicians show well applicability of the nomogram.",duplicate of 11371,,,

Q.","The Effect of Preoperative Methylprednisolone on Postoperative Delirium in Older Patients Undergoing Gastrointestinal Surgery: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial","BACKGROUND: Preoperative administration of methylprednisolone reduced circulating markers of endothelial activation. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was to evaluate whether a single preoperative dose of methylprednisolone reduced the rate of postoperative delirium (POD) in older patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery and its association with the shedding of endothelial glycocalyx markers. METHODS: About 168 patients, aged 65-80 years and scheduled for laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery, were randomized to 2 mg/kg methylprednisolone (Group M, n = 84) or equivalent dose of placebo (Group C, n = 84). The primary outcome was the incidence of delirium during the first 5 days after surgery, assessed by the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). POD severity was rated daily using CAM-Severity (CAM-S). Levels of syndecan-1, heparan sulfate, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were measured at baseline, 1 day, and 3 days after surgery. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, methylprednisolone greatly reduced the incidence of delirium at 72 hours following surgery (9 [10.7%] vs 20 [23.8%], p = .03, OR = 2.22 [95% CI 1.05-4.59]). No between-group difference was found in the cumulative CAM-S score (p = .14). The levels of heparan sulfate, syndecan-1, and TNF-α in Group M were lower than that in Group C (p < .05 and p < .01), while the level of BDNF in Group M was higher than that in Group C (p < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative administration of methylprednisolone does not reduce the severity of POD, but may reduce the incidence of delirium after gastrointestinal surgery in older patients, which may be related to a reduction in circulating markers of endothelial degradation, followed by the increase of BDNF level.

I.",The Association Between Preoperative Independent Ambulatory Status and Outcomes After Open Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repairs,"BACKGROUND: Preoperative functional status is appreciated as a key determinant of decision-making when evaluating patients for complex elective surgeries. We used the Vascular Quality Initiative to analyze the effect of being able to independently ambulate on outcomes after open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repairs. METHODS: We identified all patients who underwent elective or urgent open AAA repairs from January 2013 to August 2019 in the Vascular Quality Initiative registry. We recorded demographic variables, comorbidities, and operative factors such as approach, operative ischemia time, proximal clamp site, and presence of iliac aneurysms. Short-term and long-term outcomes included 30-day mortality, any perioperative complications, failure to rescue (defined as death after a complication), and 1-year all-cause mortality. We dichotomized patients based on their ability to independently ambulate (Ambulatory) or inability to ambulate independently (Non-Ambulatory) and used both multivariable logistic regressions and cox-proportional hazards models to evaluate outcomes. RESULTS: Of 5,371 patients, 328 (6.1%) could not ambulate independently and were more likely to be older (median age 69 vs. 72), female (25% vs. 38%), and have greater comorbidities. Overall outcomes were: 4.3% for 30-day mortality, 38.7% for complications, 10.2% for failure-to-rescue, and 6.9% for 1-year mortality. Univariate analysis showed higher rates of all adverse outcomes in non-ambulatory patients. On adjusted analysis, non-ambulatory patients had increased odds of complications by 46% (OR 1.46 [95%-CI 1.11-1.91]) and 1-year mortality by 46% (HR 1.46 [95%-CI 1.06-1.99]), but not failure to rescue (OR 1.05 [95%-CI 0.67-1.62]) or 30-day mortality (OR 1.22 [95%-CI 0.82-1.81]). Increased hospital volume, age, and increased operative renal ischemia time were independently associated with adverse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Non-ambulatory status was observed in a small percentage of patients undergoing open AAA repair but was associated with higher rates of post-operative complications and 1-year mortality. Ambulatory capacity is one of the key determinants of outcomes following open AAA repair. In patients with poor ambulatory function, a conservative approach is highly recommended over invasive open surgical intervention.",duplicate of 10828,,,

Postoperative delirium is one of the most common complications after hip fracture, but no study has assessed the impact of therapeutics received during a dedicated orthogeriatric care pathway on its incidence. Our main objective was to assess the association between drugs used in emergency, operating, and recovery departments and postoperative delirium during the acute stay. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: All patients ≥70 years old admitted for hip fracture to the emergency department and hospitalized in our unit for perioperative geriatric care after hip fracture surgery under general anesthesia between July 2009 and December 2019 in an academic hospital in Paris. METHODS: Demographic, clinical, and biological data and all medications administered pre-, peri-, and postoperatively were prospectively collected by 3 geriatricians. Postoperative delirium in the unit for perioperative geriatric care was assessed by using the confusion assessment method scale. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess variables independently associated with postoperative delirium. RESULTS: A total of 490 patients were included [mean (SD) age 87 (6) years]; 215 (44%) had postoperative delirium. The occurrence was not associated with therapeutics administered during the dedicated orthogeriatric care pathway. Probability of postoperative delirium was associated with advanced age [>90 years, odds ratio (OR) 2.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-3.89], dementia (OR 3.51, 95% CI 2.14--5.82), depression (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.14-3.01), and preoperative use of beta-blockers (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.10-2.79).

The present study aimed to investigate the trends and research status of perioperative care for the elderly in the anesthesiology field. METHODS: We screened manuscripts published between May 31, 1991, and May 31, 2020, from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). A clustered network was derived from all references cited in all of the included manuscripts. The top authors, journals, institutions, countries, keywords, co-cited articles, and trends were identified through bibliometric analysis and visualization using CiteSpace 5.8.R3 and VOSviewer 1.6.15. RESULTS: We included a total of 1860 manuscripts published between 1991 and 2020. The number of publications on perioperative care for the elderly sharply increased from 2014 onwards. The United States of America and the University of California, San Francisco were the leading publication country (24.8%, 461/1860) and institution (2.6%, 48/1860), respectively. High-frequency keywords in cluster analysis included the type of anesthesia, postoperative pain management, postoperative cognitive dysfunction, and postoperative delirium, indicating postoperative cognitive dysfunction and postoperative delirium remain the focus areas for research in perioperative care for the elderly. Organ function protection was the new research focus according to the burst detection analysis of top keywords. CONCLUSIONS: The number of studies on perioperative care for the elderly has increased apparently worldwide. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction and postoperative delirium remain primary research focus areas. Organ function protection appears to be the second most highly researched topic in the perioperative care for the elderly.",duplicate of 10522,,,

M.",Lidocaine Infusion for the Management of Postoperative Pain and Delirium (LIMPP): protocol for a randomised control trial,"INTRODUCTION: Postoperative delirium is a frequent adverse event following elective non-cardiac surgery. The occurrence of delirium increases the risk of functional impairment, placement to facilities other than home after discharge, cognitive impairment at discharge, as well as in-hospital and possibly long-term mortality. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of effective strategies to minimise the risk from modifiable risk factors, including postoperative pain control and the analgesic regimen. Use of potent opioids, currently the backbone of postoperative pain control, alters cognition and has been associated with an increased risk of postoperative delirium. Literature supports the intraoperative use of lidocaine infusions to decrease postoperative opioid requirements, however, whether the use of postoperative lidocaine infusions is associated with lower opioid requirements and subsequently a reduction in postoperative delirium has not been investigated. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Lidocaine Infusion for the Management of Postoperative Pain and Delirium trial is a randomised, double-blinded study of a postoperative 48-hour infusion of lidocaine at 1.33 mg/kg/hour versus placebo in older patients undergoing major reconstructive spinal surgery at the University of California, San Francisco. Our primary outcome is incident delirium measured daily by the Confusion Assessment Method in the first three postoperative days. Secondary outcomes include delirium severity, changes in cognition, pain scores, opioid use, incidence of opioid related side effects and functional benefits including time to discharge and improved recovery from surgery. Lidocaine safety will be assessed with daily screening questionnaires and lidocaine plasma levels. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study protocol has been approved by the ethics board at the University of California, San Francisco. The results of this study will be published in a peer-review journal and presented at national conferences as poster or oral presentations.

W.",Risk factors for delirium in elderly patients after lumbar spinal fusion,"OBJECTIVE: To identify perioperative risk factors for postoperative delirium (POD) in patients aged 65 or older undergoing lumbar spinal fusion procedures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis was performed on patients undergoing lumbar spinal fusion over an approximately three-year period at a single institution. Demographic and perioperative data were obtained from electronic medical records. The primary outcome was the presence of postoperative delirium assayed by the Delirium Observation Screening Scale (DOSS) and Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed on the data. RESULTS: Of the 702 patients included in the study, 173 (24.6%) developed POD. Our analysis revealed that older age (p < 0.001), lower preoperative hemoglobin (p < 0.001), and higher ASA status (p < 0.001), were significant preoperative risk factors for developing POD. The only significant intraoperative risk factor was a higher number of spinal levels that were instrumented (p < 0.001). Higher pain scores on postoperative day 1 (p < 0.001), and lower postoperative hemoglobin (p < 0.001) were associated with increased POD; as were ICU admission (p < 0.001) and increased length of ICU stay (p < 0.001). Patients who developed POD had a longer hospital stay (p < 0.001) with lower rates of discharge to home as opposed to an inpatient facility (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Risk factors for POD in older adults undergoing lumbar spinal fusion surgery include advanced age, diabetes, lower preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin, higher ASA grade, greater extent of surgery, and higher postoperative pain scores. Patients with delirium had a higher incidence of postoperative ICU admission, increased length of stay, decreased likelihood of discharge to home and increased mortality, all consistent with prior studies. Further studies may determine whether adequate management of anemia and pain lead to a reduction in the incidence of postoperative delirium in these patients.",duplicate of 16370,,,

We conducted a multi-center prospective study to evaluate the role of the G8 as a screening tool in the assessment of intra and post-operative complications of elderly patients (≥70 y.o.) undergoing surgery for kidney cancer. A total of 162 patients were prospectively enrolled between January 2015 to January 2019 and divided into two study groups (frail vs. not-frail) according to their geriatric risk profile based on G8 score. Several factors (i.e., age, CCI, ASA score, preoperative anemia, RENAL score, surgical procedures, and techniques) were analyzed to identify whether any of them would configure as a statistically significant predictor of surgical complications. According to the G8 Score, 90 patients were included in the frail group. A total of 52 frail patients vs. 4 non-frail patients developed a postoperative complication of any kind (p < 0.001). Of these, 11 were major complications and all occurred in the frail group.

This study aimed to clarify the association between the severity of preoperative functional impairment and the composite postoperative outcome of major morbidity and mortality in older patients undergoing digestive tract surgery. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. We collected perioperative data of older patients (age ≥ 65 years) who underwent digestive tract surgery in our institution. The severity of functional impairment was assessed using the Barthel Index scale before surgery. The major morbidity and mortality were defined as Clavien-Dindo grade III or greater postoperative complications during hospital stay. The association between the severity of functional impairment and the major morbidity and mortality was assessed using a multivariable logistic regression model. RESULTS: 131 of 1076 patients (12.2%) developed major morbidity and mortality. After controlling for confounding factors, high Barthel Index scores were correlated with decreased risk of major morbidity and mortality (OR 0.986, 95% CI 0.976-0.997, P = 0.011); preoperative severe (OR 2.862, 95% CI 1.172-6.989, P = 0.021), but not mild or moderate (OR 1.019, 95% CI 0.602-1.726, P = 0.943) functional impairment was independently associated with an increased risk of major morbidity and mortality, when compared with independent functional status.

Sarcopenia refers to an age- or pathology-associated muscle loss and has been demonstrated to correlate with poorer outcomes in several surgical conditions. This study assessed the impact of sarcopenia on morbidity and mortality in elderly patients undergoing EL. METHODS: Patients aged ≥ 65 years-old undergoing EL between May 2012-June 2017 with a pre-operative abdominal computerised tomography (CT) scan at Middlemore Hospital (New Zealand) were included. Psoas and Skeletal Muscle Index (PMI and SMI) were calculated from abdominal CT measurements after standardisation based on height. Validated cut-offs for sarcopenia were used. Frailty was estimated using the 11-point modified frailty index (mFI). The primary outcome was 30-day, 1-year, and 4-year post-operative mortality. Secondary outcomes included correlations between mFI and sarcopenic measures, unplanned readmissions, and post-operative complications. RESULTS: A total of 167 patients (84 sarcopenic; 83 non-sarcopenic) were included. Sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic patients had similar 30-day (14.2 vs. 12.0%; p = 0.84), 1-year (23.8 vs. 25.3%; p = 0.96), and 4-year (39.3 vs. 47.0%; p = 0.40) mortality rates following an EL. Survivors had a higher mean PMI at 1-year (p = 0.0078) and 4-year (p = 0.013) but not 30-day (p = 0.40) follow-up. Sarcopenia performed poorly in discriminating between 30-day (AUC 0.51) and 1-year (AUC 0.53) mortality. The mFI did not correlate with PMI (p = 0.85) nor SMI (p = 0.18).

The overall incidence rate varies from 5% to 52% of hospitalized surgical patients based on the type of surgery that often began in the postanesthesia care unit and continues up to 5 days post-surgery. Postoperative delirium manifests as a hypoactive, hyperactive and mixed subtype. The mechanism of delirium development is not clear, but it is accepted that delirium is a result of the patient's underlying vulnerabilities or risk factors combined with an outside stressor such as infection or surgery. OBJECTIVE: To develop evidence-based recommendations for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of postoperative delirium. METHODS: Literature was searched from PubMed, CINAH, Google Scholar, and Cochrane databases that are published from 2010 to 2021 by formulating inclusion and exclusion criteria. Filtering was made depending on methodological quality, outcome, and data on population. Finally, 11 meta-analysis, 11 systematic reviews, 7 interventional studies, 11 observational studies, and recommendations of the previous clinical practice guideline developed by the American and European are included in this review. RESULTS: A total of 43 studies were considered in this evaluation. The development of this guideline was based on nine studies on risk stratification for postoperative delirium, eighteen studies on risk minimization and prevention for postoperative delirium, five studies on diagnosis for postoperative delirium, and eleven studies on treatments for postoperative delirium. CONCLUSION: Postoperative delirium management can be categorized into risk assessment, risk minimization, early diagnosis, and treatment. Early diagnosis is critical to trigger focused and effective treatment. Non-pharmacological interventions are the first-line management for both hypoactive and hyperactive postoperative with considering contributory factors and underlying causes. Antipsychotics should only be used for hyperactive delirium individuals who try to harm themselves. Current evidence suggested that dexmedetomidine can be used as a treatment option for postoperative delirium.",duplicate of 9237,,,

K.",Association Between Perioperative Medication Use and Postoperative Delirium and Cognition in Older Adults Undergoing Elective Noncardiac Surgery,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium is frequent in older adults and is associated with postoperative neurocognitive disorder (PND). Studies evaluating perioperative medication use and delirium have generally evaluated medications in aggregate and been poorly controlled; the association between perioperative medication use and PND remains unclear. We sought to evaluate the association between medication use and postoperative delirium and PND in older adults undergoing major elective surgery. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study of adults ≥70 years without dementia undergoing major elective surgery. Patients were interviewed preoperatively to determine home medication use. Postoperatively, daily hospital use of 7 different medication classes listed in guidelines as risk factors for delirium was collected; administration before delirium was verified. While hospitalized, patients were assessed daily for delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method and a validated chart review method. Cognition was evaluated preoperatively and 1 month after surgery using a neurocognitive battery. The association between prehospital medication use and postoperative delirium was assessed using a generalized linear model with a log link function, controlling for age, sex, type of surgery, Charlson comorbidity index, and baseline cognition. The association between daily postoperative medication use (when class exposure ≥5%) and time to delirium was assessed using time-varying Cox models adjusted for age, sex, surgery type, Charlson comorbidity index, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE)-II score, and baseline cognition. Mediation analysis was utilized to evaluate the association between medication use, delirium, and cognitive change from baseline to 1 month. RESULTS: Among 560 patients enrolled, 134 (24%) developed delirium during hospitalization. The multivariable analyses revealed no significant association between prehospital benzodiazepine (relative risk [RR], 1.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-2.44), beta-blocker (RR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.94-2.05), NSAID (RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.77-1.62), opioid (RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.82-1.82), or statin (RR, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.92-1.95) exposure and delirium. Postoperative hospital benzodiazepine use (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 3.23; 95% CI, 2.10-4.99) was associated with greater delirium. Neither postoperative hospital antipsychotic (aHR, 1.48; 95% CI, 0.74-2.94) nor opioid (aHR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.62-1.11) use before delirium was associated with delirium. Antipsychotic use (either presurgery or postsurgery) was associated with a 0.34 point (standard error, 0.16) decrease in general cognitive performance at 1 month through its effect on delirium (P = .03), despite no total effect being observed. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of benzodiazepines to older adults hospitalized after major surgery is associated with increased postoperative delirium.

Rates of frail patients treated with PN increased over time, from 8.3 in 2000 to 18.1% in 2015 (all p &lt; 0.001). Frail patients showed higher rates of overall complications (43.5 vs. 30.3%), major complications (16.6 vs. 9.8%), blood transfusions (11.6 vs 8.3%) and non-home-based discharge (9.9 vs. 5.4%). longer LOS [4 (IQR: 3-6) vs. 4 (IQR: 2-5) days] and higher THCs ($43,906 vs. $38,447 - all p &lt; 0.001). Moreover, frailty status independently predicted overall complications (OR: 1.73), major complications (OR: 1.63), longer LOS (RR: 1.07) and higher THCs (RR: +$7506). Finally, a dose-response on the risk of suboptimal surgical outcomes was shown in patients with multiple risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: One out of seven patients is frail at time of surgery and this rate is on the rise. Moreover, frailty is associated with adverse outcomes after PN. In consequence, preoperative assessment of frailty status should be implemented, to identify patients who may benefit from pre- or postoperative measures aimed at improving surgical outcomes in this patient population.",duplicate of 10886,,,

Therefore, it is important to manage delirium during the entire perioperative period. Preoperative anxiety is associated with poor prognosis in postoperative patients who have undergone cardiovascular surgery. This study aims to investigate the relationship between preoperative anxiety and onset of delirium after cardiovascular surgery in elderly patients (aged 65 years or older), considering the individual psychological characteristics, such as personality and stress coping skills in response to anxiety, as confounding factors. METHODS: This prospective study included patients aged >65 years in a preoperative state before undergoing cardiovascular surgery. Subjects were divided into two groups based on whether they experienced postoperative delirium, or not. We compared clinical and demographic factors, preoperative psychiatric and psychological factors, and intraoperative and perioperative physical factors between the control and delirium groups. Multiple imputations were used to account for missing data. RESULTS: Out of 168 subjects enrolled in this study, 26 (15.5%) developed postoperative delirium. Univariate analysis showed significant differences in age (P = 0.027), cognitive function (P = 0.007), agreeableness (P = 0.029), and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-II (APACHE-II) score (P = 0.023) between the delirium and control groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis did not identify a significant association between preoperative anxiety and the onset of postoperative delirium. However, age (odds ratio (OR) = 1.114, P = 0.018), agreeableness (OR = 0.555, P = 0.008), and the APACHE-II score (OR = 1.227, P = 0.008) were identified as risk factors for postoperative delirium. CONCLUSION: Agreeableness, one of the personality traits associated with preoperative anxiety, appears to be involved in the development of postoperative delirium as an independent psychological factor, regardless of age or physical factors.",duplicate of 11346,,,

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine differences in perioperative inflammatory biomarkers between older and younger patients, and between patients with and without frailty. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and CINAHL databases were searched (Inception to June 23, 2020). Observational or experimental studies reporting the perioperative level or activity of biomarkers in surgical patients stratified by age or frailty status were included. The primary outcome was inflammatory biomarkers (grouped by window of ascertainment: pre-op; post-op: <12 hours, 12-24 hours, 1-3 days, 3 days to 1 week, and >1 week). Quality assessment was conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Inverse-variance, random-effects meta-analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Forty-five studies (4263 patients) were included in the review, of which 36 were pooled for meta-analysis (28 noncardiac and 8 cardiac studies). Two studies investigated frailty as the exposure, while the remaining investigated age. In noncardiac studies, older patients had higher preoperative levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP), lower preoperative levels of lymphocytes, and higher postoperative levels of IL-6 (<12 hours) and CRP (12-24 hours) than younger patients. In cardiac studies, older patients had higher preoperative levels of IL-6 and CRP and higher postoperative levels of IL-6 (<12 hours and >1 week). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate a paucity of frailty-specific studies; however, the presence of age-associated differences in the perioperative inflammatory response is consistent with age-associated states of chronic systemic inflammation and immunosenescence. Additional studies assessing frailty-specific changes in the systemic biologic response to surgery may inform the development of targeted interventions.",duplicate of 8395,,,

Emerging evidence suggests that frailty is pertinent to the clinical outcomes of older patients with hip fracture. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study on older patients (aged ≥65 years) who underwent orthopedic repair with hip fracture under spinal or general anesthesia between June 1, 2019 and May 31, 2020. Demographic, surgical, and anesthetic features; chart-derived frailty index (CFI); occurrence of complications; and length of stay were retrospectively collected by reviewing patients' anesthesia records and medical charts. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to their CFI: high CFI group (CFI, 3-5) and low CFI group (CFI, 0-2). The CFI was calculated as the addition of the patient's conditions, including age >70 years, preoperative body mass index <18.5 kg/m2, hematocrit <35%, albumin <34 g/L, and serum creatinine >176.8 mol/L (2.0 mg/dL). The EuroQol 5-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D) was obtained through telephone interviews 12 months after surgery to assess mortality and long-term quality of life. RESULTS: During the study period, 381 patients met the inclusion criteria. Patients in the high CFI group had an increased incidence of delirium by 13.80% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.31-21.29) (17 [16.6%] vs 8 [2.8%]; P < .001) compared to patients in the low CFI group. More patients in the high CFI group had pneumonia with an increased incidence of 17.71% (95% CI, 7.08-23.34) (40 [39.2%] vs 60 [21.5%]; P < .001) than patients in the low CFI group. Postoperative hospital stay was significantly longer in the high CFI group (8 [6-12] vs 7 [5-10] days; P = .0222) than in the low CFI group. More patients died in the high CFI group 1 year after surgery with an increased mortality of 19.33% (95% CI, 9.47-29.18) (26.4% [23/87] vs 7.1% [16/225]; P < .001) than patients in the low CFI group. A total of 64 patients in the high CFI group and 209 patients in the low CFI group completed the EQ-5D survey 1 year after surgery. The EQ-5D score in the high CFI group was significantly lower than that in the low CFI group (0.63 ± 0.22 vs 0.72 ± 0.22; P = .002).

TRIAL DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Double-blind, parallel randomised control trial at a tertiary care medical centre in South Korea. Initially, 140 women aged 20-65 years who underwent general anaesthesia and had an American Society of Anesthesiology physical status classification of I or II were randomly assigned to the intervention group or the control group, and 134 patients (intervention n=65; control n=69) completed the study. INTERVENTION: Intramuscular administration of midazolam (0.05 mg/kg) or placebo (normal saline 0.01 mL/kg) on arrival at the preoperative holding area. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was the patient's overall satisfaction with the anaesthesia experience as determined by questionnaire responses on the day after surgery. Satisfaction was defined as a response of 3 or 4 on a five-point scale (0-4). The secondary outcomes included blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen desaturation, recovery duration and postoperative pain. RESULTS: Patients who received midazolam were more satisfied than those who received placebo (percentage difference: 21.0%, OR 3.56, 95% CI 1.46 to 8.70). A subgroup analysis revealed that this difference was greater in patients with anxiety, defined as those whose Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale anxiety score was ≥11, than that for the whole sample population (percentage difference: 24.0%, OR 4.33, 95% CI 1.25 to 14.96).

Recently, vitamin D was shown to improve cognitive dysfunction caused by Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. This study aims to explore the correlation between preoperative serum vitamin D and postoperative cognitive disorder (POCD) occurrence in elderly patients with gastrointestinal tumors to guide perioperative medication use and promote early patient recovery. METHODS: This study recruited 238 elderly patients (65 ≤ age ≤ 85) who underwent gastrointestinal tumor surgery; 117 cases were enrolled, and 55 controls of the same age and education level as the cases were included. Blood samples were taken preoperatively and at 7, 15, 30, and 90 days postoperatively, and plasma vitamin D (25OH-D3) and glutathione (GSH) was measured. Different from the previous diagnosis of POCD was obtained by telephone interview through Cognitive Status Modified Telephone Interview (TICS-m), mainly for memory impairment, a series of neuropsychological tests was used to evaluate cognitive function, Picture Recollect Test, Stroop Color-word Test, and Digit Symbol Substitution Test were used to comprehensively evaluate the three domains of cognitive function of patients, namely memory, attention and information processing ability. All neuropsychiatric assessments were performed at the bedside and completed face-to-face by the assessment staff and the patient. RESULTS: A total of 65.8% (77/117) of elderly patients undergoing gastrointestinal tumor surgery had preoperative vitamin D deficiency (serum 25OH-D concentration < 12 ng/ml), of whom 46.7% (36/77, 7 days after surgery), 31.2% (24/77, 15 days after surgery), 15.6% (12/77, 30 days after surgery), and 9% (7/77, 90 days after surgery) of patients developed POCD; 7.5% (3/40) of patients without vitamin D deficiency developed PNDs, which was detected only on the 7th day after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency can increase neurocognitive disorder risk in elderly patients during the perioperative period, possibly because low vitamin D levels cannot effectively inhibit the postoperative oxidative stress increase.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of osteopenia as a risk factor for severe postoperative complications in elderly patients who underwent emergency gastrointestinal surgery. METHODS: This study comprised 103 elderly patients who underwent emergency gastrointestinal surgery. Osteopenia was diagnosed by measuring bone mineral density, which was calculated as the average pixel density in the midvertebral core at the 11th thoracic vertebra on the preoperative plain computed tomography image. We retrospectively investigated the relationship between preoperative osteopenia and severe postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo classification ≥III). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the risk factors for severe postoperative complications. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (22.3%) developed severe postoperative complications. The optimal cutoff value of bone mineral density for severe postoperative complications was 119.5 Hounsfield unit (HU) and 39 patients (37.9%) were diagnosed with osteopenia.

The prevalence of chronic pain and undiagnosed cognitive difficulties in middle age and older adults is increasing. Of the cognitive systems, executive function and episodic memory are most relevant to chronic pain. We examined the hypothesis that cognitive screening composite scores for executive function and memory would negatively associate with pain intensity and pain disability in a group of middle-aged and older adults with knee pain with or at risk for osteoarthritis. METHODS: A total of 120 adults (44 men/76 women), an average age of 59 years, participated in the study. Demographic, health history, clinical pain, and cognitive measures were completed. Relationships between pain intensity, pain disability, and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) total and composite scores were examined with relevant covariates in the model. RESULTS: MoCA raw scores ranged from 13 to 30 with a mean score of 23.9. Pain intensity was negatively associated with overall MoCA total and executive function and memory composite scores. Pain disability over the previous 6 months was negatively associated with executive function, while pain disability over the past 48 hours was not associated with executive function.

Preliminary analysis found significant rates of previously unrecognized objective cognitive dysfunction, multimorbidity and polypharmacy. We now examine whether chronological age as a sole risk factor can predict a patient's perioperative outcomes, and if traditional risk calculators that rely heavily on chronological age can accurately capture a patient's true risk. METHODS: This was a retrospective secondary analysis of the previously reported GrAMPS trial enrolling patients 60 years and older with a planned elective repair of a ventral or inguinal hernia. The rates of key postoperative outcomes were compared between various cohorts stratified by chronological age. Previously validated risk screening calculators [Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP)] were compared between cohorts. RESULTS: In total, 55 (78.6%) of the 70 patients enrolled in GrAMPS underwent operative intervention by May 2021, including 26 VHR and 29 IHRs. Cohorts stratified by chronological age had similar rates of key perioperative wound and age-related outcomes including readmissions, postoperative complications, non-home discharges, and length of stay. Additionally, while the commonly used risk calculators, CCI and NSQIP, consistently predicted worse outcomes for older hernia patients (stratified by both median age and age-tertiles), screening positive on these risk assessments were not actually predictive of a greater incidence of postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: Chronological age does not accurately predict worse adverse postoperative complications in older hernia patients. Additionally, traditional risk screening calculators that rely heavily on age to risk stratify may not accurately capture a patient's true surgical risk. Surgeons should continue to explore nuanced patient risk assessments that more accurately capture age-related risk factors to better individualize perioperative risk.",duplicate of 8248,,,

METHODS: Preoperative frailty status was examined by the G8 questionnaire, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, the Charlson Comorbidity Index and the American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status System, as well as the Lee-Schonberg prognostic index. The main outcome measures were perioperative laboratory values, intraoperative surgical parameters and immediately postoperative complications. RESULTS: 153 consecutive women ≥ 60 years with all stages of EC, who received primary elective surgery at the University Medical Center Mainz between 2008 and 2019 were classified with selected global health assessment tools according to their preoperative performance status. In contrast to conventional prognostic parameters like older age and higher BMI, increasing frailty was significantly associated with preoperative anemia and perioperative transfusions (p < 0.05). Moreover, in patients preoperatively classified as frail significantly more postoperative complications (G8 Score: frail: 20.7% vs. non-frail: 6.7%, p = 0.028; ECOG: frail: 40.9% vs. non-frail: 2.8%, p = 0.002; and CCI: frail: 25.0% vs. non-frail: 7.4%, p = 0.003) and an increased length of hospitalization were recorded. According to propensity score matching, the risk for developing postoperative complications for frail patients was approximately two-fold higher, depending on which global health assessment tool was used. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperatively assessed frailty significantly predicts post-surgical morbidity rates in contrast to conventionally used single prognostic parameters such as age or BMI.

The risk analysis index (RAI) is a validated frailty score system, which has been shown to predict for short-term outcomes and long-term mortality in various surgical subspecialties. In the present study, we applied the frailty score to a veteran aneurysm population who had undergone nonemergent endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR). METHODS: After obtaining institutional review board approval, the Veteran Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Program data were queried for endovascular repair of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm or dissection using the Current Procedural Terminology codes 34,800, 34,803, and 34,805 from 2001 to 2018. The preoperative variables were used to calculate the RAI score. The patients were placed into six cohorts according to the RAI score (≤20, 21-25, 26-30, 31-35, 35-40, and ≥41). The χ(2) test and analysis of variance test were used compare the cohorts. Forward logistic regression modeling was used to determine the risks of each cohort. RESULTS: From 2001 to 2018, 5568 patients had undergone EVAR. Of the 5568 patients, 99.6% were male, with a mean age of 71 ± 8 years. Of these patients, 4.5%, 43.8%, 33.9%, 11.7%, 4.2%, and 1.8% were included in the following RAI groups: ≤20, 21 to 25, 26 to 30, 31 to 35, 35 to 40, and ≥41, respectively. Frailty was associated with increased rates of overall complications, death, and an increased length of stay. When risk adjusted, frailty at the highest vs lowest level was associated with 2.7 times the odds of any complication developing and 4.4 times the odds of mortality ≤30 days. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty, as determined by the RAI, was associated with postoperative outcomes in a dose-dependent manner. Frailty was associated with higher rates of major cardiac (myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest), pulmonary (pneumonia, failure to wean from ventilation, reintubation), renal (renal failure), overall complications, length of stay, and death.

The aim of this subgroup analysis of the PRe-Operative Prediction of postoperative DElirium by appropriate SCreening (PROPDESC) trial in patients aged 70 years and older was to identify preoperative risk factors and the impact of POD on length of stay (LOS) in intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital. METHODS: Of the total 1097 patients recruited at a German university hospital (from September 2018 to October 2019) in the PROPDESC prospective observational study, 588 patients aged 70 years and older (mean age 77.2 ± 4.7 years) were included for subgroup analysis. The primary endpoint POD was considered positive if one of the following tests were positive on any of the five postoperative visit days: Confusion Assessment Method for ICU (CAM-ICU), Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), 4'A's (4AT) and Delirium Observation Scale (DOS). Trained doctoral students carried out these visitations and additionally the nursing staff were interviewed for completion of the DOS. To evaluate the independent effect of POD on LOS in ICU and in hospital, a multi-variable linear regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: The POD incidence was 25.9%.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 78 patients with bladder cancer who underwent robot-assisted radical cystectomy with intracorporeal urinary diversion at Fujita Health University between 2011 and 2021. Baseline characteristics and perioperative outcomes were compared between the cohorts with and without ileus. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the risk factors for postoperative ileus. RESULTS: Out of the 78 patients included in this study, 20 (25.6%) developed postoperative ileus. The ileus cohort was associated with a significantly lower Geriatric-8 score (P = 0.003) and a higher rate of previous abdominal/pelvic surgery (P = 0.04) compared with those of the nonileus cohort. Significantly longer intestinal tract reconstruction time, hospital stay, time to mobilization, fluid intake, solid intake, flatus, and stool were observed in the ileus cohort. According to the results of the logistic regression analysis, the Geriatric-8 sum (P = 0.009), time to mobilization (P = 0.03), and time to fluid intake (P = 0.004) were independent predictors of postoperative ileus. In the model predicting postoperative ileus, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.716, and the cutoff value of the Geriatric-8 sum was 13. CONCLUSIONS: Early mobilization and fluid intake and low Geriatric-8 scores were significant risk factors for postoperative ileus. Preoperative Geriatric-8 evaluation is a useful tool for predicting postoperative ileus. Comprehensive enhanced recovery after surgery, including key components, may help bowel recovery and prevent subsequent ileus.",duplicate of 10173,,,

P.",The effects of remifentanil-propofol combined with dexmedetomidine on cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients after ureteroscopic holmium laser lithotripsy: a double-blind randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: A clinical study indicated that infusion of dexmedetomidine without a loading dose administered intraoperatively provided a smooth and hemodynamically stable emergence and improved the quality of recovery with fewer postoperative side effects and reduced analgesic requirements. The objective was to determine whether administering remifentanil-propofol combined with dexmedetomidine during general anesthesia would decrease the incidence and severity of postoperative emergence agitation, anxiety, and depression without affecting cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients. METHODS: A total of 120 elderly patients scheduled for ureteroscopic holmium laser lithotripsy were randomly allocated to the PR group and administered normal saline, and the PRD group was administered dexmedetomidine 0.4 μg kg(-1) h(-1) intravenously after the induction of anesthesia and stopped 30 min before the end of surgery. The primary outcome was the Mini-Mental State Examination score. The secondary outcomes were the Richmond Agitation Sedation, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale scores; the memory span for Arabic numerals; the duration of surgery; and the time to spontaneous respiration, recovery, and extubation. RESULTS: The MMSE scores were lower at T(1-2) in the two groups (P < 0.001). The dosage of propofol and remifentanil decreased more significantly in the PRD group than in the PR group (P < 0.001). Both the RASS scores and the incidence of emergence agitation (EA) in the PRD group were significantly lower than those in the PR group at t(1-3) (P < 0.001). Compared to the PR group, the ZSDS scores and STAI scores at T(1-2) were lower in the PRD group (P < 0.005). The number of the Arabic numbers that were accurately recalled from memory was lower at T(2) in the PR group than in the PRD group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine administration has no influence on postoperative cognitive dysfunction but could reduce both the dosage of remifentanil and propofol needed during ureteroscopic holmium laser lithotripsy and the incidence and severity of postoperative emergence agitation, anxiety, and depression in elderly patients.

The association between preoperative frailty and postoperative outcomes in patients with hip fractures is unclear. To address this issue, we performed a meta-analysis to determine the association of frailty with postoperative mortality, complications, and readmission in patients with hip fractures. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and The Cochrane Library for cohort studies of frailty associated with postoperative adverse events in patients with hip fractures from inception to November 6, 2021. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate the quality of the included literature. Statistical analysis of meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3. RESULTS: Twelve retrospective cohort studies and seven prospective cohort studies involving a total of 62,132 patients met the inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis. Compared with non-frail patients, the pooled results showed that frailty was associated with patient in-hospital mortality (relative risk [RR] = 2.93; 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 2.56-3.34), 30-day mortality (RR = 2.85, 95%CI: 1.67-4.85) and total complications (RR = 1.79, 95%CI: 1.50-2.15). Subgroup analysis showed that the type of study design and frailty assessment tool had no significant effect on the results. Sensitivity analysis showed that the polled results of frailty predicted one-year mortality and 30-day readmission was unstable. CONCLUSIONS: In this meta-analysis, we found that preoperative frailty may be associated with postoperative adverse events in patients with hip fractures, including in-hospital mortality, 30-day mortality, and postoperative complications.Systematic Review Registration: PROSPERO, identifier: CRD42021287739.",duplicate of 11056,,,

A systematic review,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Frailty as a concept is not yet fully understood, and is not the same as comorbidity. It is associated with an increased risk of adverse events and mortality after surgery, which makes its preoperative assessment significant. Despite its relevance, it still remains unclear which scales are appropriate for use in patients with spinal pathology. PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility and measurement properties of frailty scales for spine patients, specifically with adult spinal deformity (ASD), and to propose adequate scales for primary triage to prevent surgery in too frail patients and for preoperative assessment to modify patients' condition and surgical plans. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Systematic review. METHODS: Systematic search was performed between 2010 and 2021 including terms relating to spinal disorders, frailty scales, and methodological quality. Characteristics of the studies and frailty scales and data describing relation to treatment outcomes were extracted. The risk of bias was determined with the QAREL score. RESULTS: Of the 1993 references found, 88 original studies were included and 23 scales were identified. No prospective interventional study was found where the preoperative frailty assessment was implemented. Predictive value of scales for surgical outcomes varied, dependent on spinal disorders, type of surgeries, patients' age and frailty at baseline, and outcomes. Seventeen studies reported measurement properties of eight scales but these studies were not free of bias. In 30 ASD studies, ASD-Frailty Index (ASD-FI, n=14) and 11-item modified Frailty Index (mFI-11, n=11) were most frequently used. These scales were mainly studied in registry studies including young adult population, and carry a risk of sample bias and make their validity in elderly population unclear. ASD-FI covers multidisciplinary concepts of frailty with 40 items but its feasibility in clinical practice is questionable due to its length. The Risk Analysis Index, another multidisciplinary scale with 14 items, has been implemented for preoperative assessment in other surgical domains and was proven to be feasible and effective in interventional prospective studies. The FRAIL is a simple questionnaire with five items and its predictive value was confirmed in prospective cohort studies in which only elderly patients were included. CONCLUSIONS: No adequate scale was identified in terms of methodological quality and feasibility for daily practice. Careful attention should be paid when choosing an adequate scale, which depends on the setting of interest (eg triage or preoperative work-up). We recommend to further study a simple and predictive scale such as FRAIL for primary triage and a comprehensive and feasible scale such as Risk Analysis Index for preoperative assessment for patients undergoing spine surgery, as their adequacy has been shown in other medical domains.",duplicate of 6808,,,

C.",Predictive value of selected geriatric parameters for postoperative outcomes in older patients with rectal cancer - A multicenter cohort study,"INTRODUCTION: Older patients have a higher risk for complications after rectal cancer surgery. Although screening for geriatric impairments may improve risk prediction in this group, it has not been studied previously. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated patients ≥70 years with elective surgery for non-metastatic rectal cancer between 2014 and 2018 in nine Dutch hospitals. The predictive value of six geriatric parameters in combination with standard preoperative predictors was studied for postoperative complications, delirium, and length of stay (LOS) using logistic regression analyses. The geriatric parameters included the four VMS-questionnaire items pertaining to functional impairment, fall risk, delirium risk, and malnutrition, as well as mobility problems and polypharmacy. Standard predictors included age, sex, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)-classification, comorbidities, tumor stage, and neoadjuvant therapy. Changes in model performance were evaluated by comparing Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the regression models with and without geriatric parameters. RESULTS: We included 575 patients (median age 75 years; 32% female). None of the geriatric parameters improved risk prediction for complications or LOS. The addition of delirium risk to the standard preoperative prediction model improved model performance for predicting postoperative delirium (AUC 0.75 vs 0.65, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Geriatric parameters did not improve risk prediction for postoperative complications or LOS in older patients with rectal cancer. Delirium risk screening using the VMS-questionnaire improved risk prediction for delirium. Older patients undergoing rectal cancer surgery are a pre-selected group with few impairments. Geriatric screening may have additional value earlier in the care pathway before treatment decisions are made.",duplicate of 10664,,,

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional database analysis. SETTING: American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database. METHODS: The 2005 to 2017 ACS-NSQIP was queried for patients undergoing complex HNS. Five-item modified frailty index (mFI) was calculated based on functional status and history of diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, and chronic hypertension. RESULTS: A total of 2786 patients (73.1% male) with a mean age of 62.0 ± 11.6 years were included. Compared to nonfrail patients (41.2%), patients with mFI ≥1 (58.8%) had shorter length of operation (P = .021), longer length of stay (LOS) (P < .001), and higher rates of 30-day reoperation (P = .009), medical complications (P < .001), discharge to nonhome facility (DNHF) (P < .001), and mortality (P = .047). These parameters remained statistically significant when compared across all individual mFI scores (all P < .05). After adjusting for age, sex, race, body mass index, smoking, and American Society of Anesthesiologists score via multivariate logistic regression, patients with mFI ≥1 were significantly more likely to undergo reoperation (odds ratio [OR], 1.39), surgical complications (OR, 1.19), medical complications (OR, 1.55), prolonged LOS (OR, 1.29), and DNHF (OR, 1.56) (all P < .05). Multivariate logistic regression also demonstrated that after adjusting for confounders, compared to patients with mFI = 1, patients with mFI = 2-5 (18.7%) were more likely to undergo shorter operations (OR, 0.74), have medical (OR, 1.46) or any complications (OR, 1.27), and have DNHF (OR, 1.62) (all P < .05). CONCLUSION: The 5-point mFI can independently predict short-term surgical outcomes following complex HNS.

A retrospective analysis of all surgically treated patients presenting with IF was conducted at a single Level I trauma center in China between Jan. 2016 and Jan. 2020. The data concerning patients' demographics, injury-related data, surgery-related data, operation-related data, in-hospital data, and postoperative outcomes were extracted. To minimize potential confounding and selection bias, the propensity score matching (PSM) method was performed via the caliper matching method by using a 1 : 1 ratio. After PSM, McNemar's chi-square tests were used to examine the association of using IVP with outcome analyses. The Spearman correlations of IVP using, pain scores, and the factors which may influence them were also computed. After screening 2963 consecutive patients, 2166 were included finally, including 1576 in the non-IVP group and 590 in the IVP group. After PSM, 531 remained in each group. The pain scores at discharge were significantly between the two groups before and after matching (all p < 0.001). The differences of delirium rate and functional outcomes became significant after propensity score-based matching (p=0.001 and 0.033, respectively), although they were not significant before matching. No significant difference was observed in other operation-related data, LOS, and crude mortality rates at 30-day, 90-day, and 12-month before and after PSM.

Identifying those at greatest risk of discharge to a postacute care facility would improve postoperative planning. We aimed to examine the role of preoperative cognitive and functional status on discharge disposition after emergency surgery in older adults. METHODS: We used American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Geriatric Pilot Project data from 2014 to 2018 to identify patients ≥65 y who underwent inpatient emergency surgery. The primary outcome was nonhome discharge, defined as discharge to an acute rehabilitation facility, a skilled nursing facility, or a nonhome unskilled facility. Logistic regression controlling for patient characteristics was used to determine the association of preoperative geriatric-specific variables with nonhome discharge. RESULTS: Of 3494 patients, 53.9% were not discharged home. In multivariable analysis, a fall within the past year (odds ratio [OR] = 5.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.4-6.5) was most strongly associated with nonhome discharge. The outcome was also independently associated with preoperative use of a mobility aid (OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.7-2.4), partially dependent functional status (OR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.4-2.5), and surrogate consent (OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.1-1.8), but not cognitive impairment (OR = 1.0, 95% CI = 0.7-1.3).

Our scoping review focuses on the current evidence regarding the association between preoperative anxiety and intraoperative anesthetic and/or postoperative analgesic consumption in patients undergoing elective surgical or interventional procedures. Based on 44 studies that met the inclusion criteria, we found that preoperative anxiety has a significant positive correlation effect on intraoperative propofol and postoperative opioid consumption. The analysis of the literature is limited by the heterogeneity of preoperative anxiety tools used, study designs, data analyses, and outcomes. The use of shorter, validated preoperative anxiety assessment tools may help optimize the intraoperative anesthetic and postoperative analgesic regimen.

METHODS: This is a post-hoc analysis of a large randomized controlled trial evaluating low vs. conventional V(T) ventilation during major non-cardiothoracic, non-intracranial surgery. The primary outcome was the incidence of ICD-10 delirium and/or the use of antipsychotic medications during hospital stay, and the absolute difference with its 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. RESULTS: We studied 1206 patients (median age of 64 [55-72] years, 59.0% males, median ARISCAT of 26 [19-37], and 47.6% of ASA 3).

METHODS: This prospective observational cohort study was performed in a PACU at a high-volume prostate cancer center. We used a convenience sample of patients > 60 years undergoing elective radical prostatectomy. Patients with a history of cerebrovascular or neurodegenerative disease were excluded. Fifteen, 30, 45, and 60 following extubation, patients were screened for signs of delirium with the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit. Three months after surgery self-reported cognitive function was assessed with the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire, and health status was evaluated with the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). RESULTS: Signs of PACU delirium were present in 32.4% (n = 72/222) of patients, and 80.2% (n = 178/222) completed the 3-month follow-up.

As patients turn 65 years, greater than 98% of the US population becomes eligible for Medicare, and this represents a time of changing healthcare coverage for many. METHODS: Patients undergoing elective TKA and THA were abstracted from the 2012 to 2018 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. Incidences of TKA and THA (combined and separate) were plotted and assessed by age. To assess factors associated with who ""delayed"" surgery until 65 years, demographic and preoperative characteristics, and postoperative adverse events were compared for the 2 years above and the 2 years below the 65-year-old mark with multivariate analysis. Significance was set at P < 0.05. RESULTS: In total, 515,139 TKA and THA patients were identified (62.04% TKA and 37.95% THA). When the number of procedures was plotted by age, a discontinuity in the bell-shaped curve was noted at age 65 years. Highlighting this finding, the changes in percent population between 63 and 64 years was -1.52%, between 64 and 65 years was +15.36%, and between 65 and 66 years was -2.32%. Relative to those who were 63 and 64 years (n = 36,511), those who were 65 and 66 years (n = 41,671) were more likely to be female, be non-Hispanic White, have a lower body mass index, and have a lower functional status but were not different in the preoperative American Society of Anesthesiologists class. CONCLUSION: In this large national sample, there was a clear step increase in undergoing TKA or THA once patients reached the age of 65 years (Medicare eligibility). This discontinuity in the bell-shaped curve may be evidence for a moral hazard in healthcare markets. Although factors in decision-making were not assessed, there were demographic factors associated with this step finding.",duplicate of 9989,,,

This was a randomized, parallel controlled trial on elderly patients who underwent unilateral total hip joint replacement surgery at the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University. METHODS: Patients in the perioperative cognitive therapy combined with rehabilitation exercise group underwent preoperative cognitive training and postoperative cognitive training, rehabilitation exercise, and standardized health care services; the control group received only postoperative standardized health care service. Patients with NCD were defined as those with two or more abnormalities on 11 neuropsychological tests. Of the 607 individuals that we screened, 86 (exercise, 50; control, 36) who completed the study were included. RESULTS: The baseline characteristics were similar for the two groups. The incidence of NCD in the exercise group (10%, 5/50) was significantly lower than that in the control group (27.8%, 10/36) (P=0.032). The HVLT-R, HVLT-R delayed recall test, and HVLT-R recognition discriminating index were significantly improved in the exercise group compared with the control group (all P<0.05). Our findings highlight the clinical significance of perioperative cognitive exercise combined with rehabilitation exercise in preventing NCD among patients after surgery and anesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that perioperative cognitive therapy combined with rehabilitation exercise can effectively reduce the incidence of NCD in elderly patients after total hip joint replacement surgery.",duplicate of 7984,,,

Few studies on frailty and its associated factors have been conducted in these patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore frailty and related factors in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. METHODS: A total of 154 patients undergoing cardiac surgery in northern Taiwan were recruited using a longitudinal study design and interviewed using structured questionnaires assessing physical activity, anxiety and depression, and social support before surgery and at 1 month and 3 months after surgery. RESULTS: The prevalence of frailty in patients undergoing cardiac surgery was 16.2%, 20.5%, and 16.6% before surgery and at 1 month and 3 months after surgery, respectively. Frail and prefrail patients undergoing cardiac surgery were more likely to be unemployed, have gout, have a higher New York Heart Association class, have preoperative dysrhythmia, undergo cardiopulmonary bypass, have a lower functional ability, have a higher European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation score, have a longer anesthesia time, have longer endotracheal tube and extracorporeal circulation times, have longer intensive care unit and hospital stays, have lower hemoglobin and albumin levels, have higher anxiety and depression levels, and have lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores. The significant predictors of prefrailty and frailty included unemployment, the presence of gout, higher New York Heart Association classes, less independence in activities of daily living, lower hemoglobin levels, and higher levels of depression. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty was associated with patients' functional status, perioperative conditions and psychosocial factors.

However, single-agent adjuvant chemotherapy is a valid treatment option in other gastrointestinal malignancies, preferred for elderly and/or frail patients. The current study used a nationwide oncology database to assess the benefit of single-agent adjuvant chemotherapy, specifically in the elderly population. METHODS: Using the National Cancer Database (2004-2016) we identified 1953 individuals with non-metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma who underwent upfront D2 gastrectomy with pathologic stage ≥ T3 or Npos and free surgical margins, and had not received either preoperative chemotherapy or pre-/postoperative radiotherapy. We used IPTW analysis to compare overall survival between individuals receiving either single- or multi-agent adjuvant chemotherapy, or referred to observation alone. RESULTS: Individuals receiving single-agent chemotherapy had an overall survival benefit compared with observation alone, with an HR of 0.70 (95% CI 0.55-0.88, p < 0.001). Individuals over the age of 65 had an OS benefit with an HR of 0.61 (95% CI 0.46-0.82, p < 0.001). Comparing individuals over the age of 65 receiving single- vs. multi-agent chemotherapy, there was no overall survival difference with an HR of 0.87 (95% CI 0.64-1.18, p = 0.38). CONCLUSIONS: Single-agent adjuvant chemotherapy with a fluoropyrimidine in locally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma following D2 gastrectomy can improve overall survival in elderly patients.

This review aims to evaluate the evidence surrounding prehabilitation in older patients anticipating liver resection and to describe how prehabilitation may be implemented. DESIGN: Problem-based narrative review with case-based discussion. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: All older adults anticipating liver resection inclusive of benign and malignant etiologies in the United States. METHODS: Literature search was performed using MeSH terms and keywords in MEDLINE via PubMed, followed by a manual second search for relevant references within selected articles. Articles were excluded if not available in the English language or did not include patients undergoing hepatectomy. RESULTS: Prehabilitation includes a range of activities including exercise, nutrition/dietary changes, and psychosocial interventions that may occur from several weeks to days preceding a surgical operation. Older adult patients who participate in prehabilitation may experience improvement in preoperative candidacy as well as improved postoperative quality of life and faster return to baseline; however, evidence supporting a reduction in postoperative length of stay and perioperative morbidity and mortality is conflicting. A variety of modalities are available for prehabilitation but lack consensus and standardization. For a provider desiring to prescribe prehabilitation, multidisciplinary assessments including geriatric, cardiopulmonary, and future remnant liver function can help determine individual patient needs and select appropriate interventions. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: In the older adult patient undergoing liver resection, the current body of literature suggests promising benefits of prehabilitation programs inclusive of functional assessment as well as multimodal interventions.

We accessed the effect of intraoperative intravenous dexmedetomidine on postoperative sleep quality in patients with endoscopic sinus surgery.  METHODS: This single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial enrolled a total of 110 participants aged 18 years to 65 years who were scheduled to receive endoscopic sinus surgery. Placebo (normal saline) or dexmedetomidine infusion (load dose 0.5 μg kg(-1) over 10 min, followed by maintenance dose 0.2 ug kg(-1) h(-1)) during surgery. The primary outcome was postoperative sleep quality. Secondary outcomes were postoperative Ramsay sedation scores, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores, serum cortisol, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and hypocretin, delirium, and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). RESULTS: Among enrolled 110 patients, 55 were randomized to administer intraoperative dexmedetomidine and placebo. In total, 14 patients (7 in each group) were excluded because of protocol deviations, and 96 patients (48 in each group) were included in the per-protocol analysis. The dexmedetomidine group had a significantly higher sleep efficiency index(SEI) (66.85[3.00] vs 65.38[3.58]), the ratio of rapid eye movement sleep to total sleep(REM)(13.63[1.45] vs 12.38[2.11]) and lower arousal index (AI) (7.20[1.00] vs 8.07[1.29]), higher Ramsay sedation score at post-operation 1 h, 12 h point, lower VAS scores at post-operation 1 h, 12 h, 24 h point, lower cortisol, higher 5-HT and hypocretin in serum than the placebo group. CONCLUSION: In this randomized clinical trial, dexmedetomidine can improve the sleep quality of patients undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery. These results suggest that this therapy may be a viable strategy to enhance postoperative sleep quality in patients with endoscopic sinus surgery.

In conjunction with the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, we piloted a comprehensive and interdisciplinary assessment and intervention protocol for perioperative care for patients aged ≥75 years undergoing elective general, gynecology-oncologic, and orthopedic surgery. The intervention included screening tools for cognitive, functional, and nutritional deficits, a Geriatric Nurse Champion on each inpatient surgical unit, and an interdisciplinary Geriatric Surgery Quality Committee. Our intervention group was compared to surgical patients during the same time period 1 year prior to the intervention, and the groups were well matched in demographics and comorbidities. The intervention group had significantly higher rates of advance care plan documentation in analysis of all patients (P < .001) and in subgroup analysis of those 85 and older (P = .006). The preintervention group had less postoperative delirium compared to the postintervention group but it was not significant and there was no difference in length of stay between groups. Various explanations for the minimal impact of the protocol exist: small sample size, presence of other hospital initiatives to reduce pressure ulcer and delirium, and clinician's awareness of project planning that led to incorporating ideas prior to official implementation. Future research implementing this protocol in naïve and/or underperforming institutions may demonstrate a greater effect. Larger sample size as well as implementation in other surgical fields may reveal a significant impact. However, if additional study does not reveal a meaningful impact of a comprehensive geriatric assessment for surgical patients, then consideration must be made regarding unrecognized factors in surgical care for older adults or perhaps that factors cannot be mitigated in older adults because they are intrinsically a higher surgical risk.",duplicate of 11264,,,

The present study was done to compare the efficacy of dexmedetomidine nebulization with intravenous dexmedetomidine and fentanyl in laparoscopic surgeries under general anesthesia. METHODS: A prospective, double blind study was conducted, and 90 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I and II patients of either gender between 18-65 years undergoing laparoscopic surgeries under general anesthesia were randomized into three groups. (1) Group N (n = 30) received dexmedetomidine nebulization 1 mcg/kg in 3 mL of 0.9% saline 15 minutes before induction and 10 mL of intravenous 0.9% saline over 10 minutes at the time of induction of anesthesia. (2) Group I (n = 30) received 0.9% saline nebulization 3 mL and intravenous dexmedetomidine 1 mcg/kg in 10 mL of 0.9% saline. (3) Group F (n = 30) received 0.9% saline nebulization 3 mL and intravenous fentanyl 2 mcg/kg in 10mL of 0.9% saline. Heart rate, blood pressure, propofol requirement, and opioid consumption were monitored throughout surgery and for 1 hour in post-operative period. Statistical analysis was done by using analysis of variance test, chi-square test. P value ＜ 0.05 was considered signifi cant. RESULTS: Suppression of hemodynamic response following intubation and pneumoperitoneum by dexmedetomidine nebulization was compared to intravenous dexmedetomidine and fentanyl. Opioid requirement was significantly lower in dexmedetomidine group than fentanyl group (P ＜ 0.05).

We assessed whether there is a difference in postoperative delirium and composite morbidity between patients receiving GA with PNB and GA alone using a national clinical database in Japan. METHODS: We compared the outcomes of patients receiving GA with PNB and GA alone from April 2016 to October 2019. The primary outcome was postoperative delirium, defined as a status requiring newly prescribed antipsychotic drugs or that given the code of a reimbursable disease after the surgery date. The secondary outcome was morbidity incidence as the occurrence of at least one of any of the following life-threatening complications. We conducted propensity score-matched analyses using covariates for patients who underwent any surgical procedure. We used instrumental variables and restricted the definition of postoperative delirium and subgroup for sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Of 653,759 patients, 90,358 received GA-PNB and 563,401 received only GA. After 1:4 propensity score matching, 89,754 patients were included in the GA-PNB and 359,015 in the GA. The adjusted ORs for postoperative delirium and composite morbidity were 0.96 (95% CIs 0.94 to 0.99; p<0.01), 0.80 (95% CIs 0.76 to 0.83; p<0.001), respectively, for the GA-PNB concerning the GA.

BACKGROUND: Although the use of preoperative comprehensive geriatric assessment to improve pre/peri and postoperative mortality has been reported for many surgical domains, its use prior to dental surgery has not been reported previously. METHODS: The data were collected retrospectively from the dental notes of 52 patients referred from the Special Care Dental (SCD) Department to the PROKARE service for optimisation prior to dental treatment under GA/CS using a case note study approach. The data extracted included patient demographic characteristics, medical history, clinical management and the treatment outcomes for each patient. The data extracted was analysed with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Key reasons for referral were caries management, retained roots and poor co-operation. Multiple co-morbidities were noted among the patients referred, with 14 (27%) having four or more co-morbidities. The PROKARE assessment identified issues such as treatment could be carried out under CS instead of GA; consent; and the need for medication change and/or further medical investigations. As per recommendations from PROKARE, 39 patients (75%) received dental treatment while five (10%) did not receive treatment, and a further eight (15%) died prior to treatment. CONCLUSION: Geriatric assessment and optimisation-based preoperative clinics in the dental management of frail, elderly patients having treatment under GA or CS techniques is valuable, but further research and assessment of current service provision are needed to increase the evidence base.",duplicate of 11456,,,

Limited orthopedic literature examines the influence that dementia has on patients undergoing elective spinal surgeries. METHODS: Employing the PearlDriver Database, a study population consisting of patients who underwent primary elective ACDF with a prior diagnosis of dementia were selected using Internal Classification Disease-9 (ICD) and ICD-10 codes. Patients with a history of trauma, infection, or malignancy were excluded. Patients with dementia were compared to matched controls via logistical regression accounting for patient demographics, medical comorbidities and levels operated on. Patients were assessed for 90-day outcomes including medical complications, emergency department visits, readmissions, one-year reoperation, hospital length of stay (LOS) and total operative hospitalization costs, and 90-day postoperative cost. RESULTS: There were 4104 patients in the dementia group and 20,269 patients in the matched control group who underwent primary ACDF. Multivariate analysis showed that patients with dementia undergoing ACDF were associated with increased 90-day major and minor medical complications (p < 0.001).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted. A total of 194 elderly patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery were included. Preoperative frailty using FRAIL questionnaire, frailty index (FI), Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) and SASA scores was assessed. Primary outcome was in-hospital Clavien-Dindo ≥grade II complications. Multiple logistic regression was used to examine the association between frailty and complications. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to explore the predictive ability of frailty. RESULTS: According to the FRAIL, FI and CFS criteria, the prevalence of frailty in the study population was 43.8%, 32.5%, and 36.6%, respectively. After adjusting for all covariates, frailty was significantly associated with postoperative complications in hospital by FRAIL [odds ratio: 5.11, 95% CI: 1.41-18.44, P = 0.013], by FI [OR: 4.25, 95% CI: 1.21-14.90, P = 0.024] and by CFS [OR: 5.10, 95% CI: 1.52-17.17, P = 0.008]. The area under the curve (AUC) for SASA was 0.768 (95% CI: 0.702-0.826).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Elderly patients with surgery for lower limb fracture under non-general anaesthesia were included. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and platelet-to-white cell ratio (PWR), which were most recently measured preceding surgery and measured within 24h after surgery, were calculated. Delirium was measured with Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) once daily from preoperative day 1 to postoperative day 3 or hospital discharge. RESULTS: The incidence of POD was 32.6% (60/184). Between patients with and those without POD, there were significant differences in preoperative hematological biomarkers (neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, NLR and PWR) and postoperative hematological biomarkers (white cell count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, NLR, PLR and PWR). More obvious changes before and after operation for NLR, PLR and C-reactive protein (CRP) were found in patients with POD. Multivariate logistic regression showed that benzodiazepines (OR, 7.912; 95% CI, 1.884-33.230; p = 0.005), change of CRP (OR, 1.017; 95% CI, 1.007-1.027; p = 0.001) and postoperative NLR (OR, 1.358; 95% CI, 1.012-1.823; p = 0.041) were associated with POD. When the changes of NLR, PLR and PWR entered multivariate logistic regression, older age (OR, 1.073; 95% CI, 1.001-1.149; p = 0.046), benzodiazepines (OR, 6.811; 95% CI, 1.652-28.081; p = 0.008), greater change of CRP (OR, 1.015; 95% CI, 1.006-1.023; p = 0.001) and greater change of NLR (OR, 1.266; 95% CI, 1.035-1.549; p = 0.022) were associated with increased risk of POD. Postoperative NLR had high accuracy to predict POD with area under curve (AUC) of 0.790 (95% CI 0.708 to 0.872). CONCLUSION: Age, benzodiazepines, postoperative NLR, change of NLR and change of CRP were independent predictable markers for POD in elderly patients undergoing surgery for lower limb fracture under non-general anaesthesia. Early postoperative NLR may help to recognize POD as soon as possible.",duplicate of 7883,,,

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 159 patients aged 75 and older referred to the Geriatrics Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center for pre-operative evaluation prior to undergoing HNC surgery. All patients completed the electronic Rapid Fitness Assessment (eRFA) within 60 days prior to surgery. The accumulated geriatric deficit (AGD) score includes twelve domains from the eRFA with a point assigned for each domain in which there is a deficit and a final point related to comorbidities. Three other metrics were individually assessed: age, Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS), and number of comorbidities. We utilized multivariable linear regression and t-tests to determine whether frailty is associated with longer length of hospital stay, 30-day intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and 30-day and 90-day postoperative mortality. RESULTS: Patients with a higher AGD score spent more time in the hospital post-operatively (1.0 day increase per unit increase in AGD; 95% CI: 0.21-1.9; p = 0.015). Lower KPS was also associated with statistically significant longer length of stay (-2.70 day change per increasing index KPS; 95% CI: -4.30 - -1.00; days; p = 0.002), while age and comorbidity were not found to be statistically associated with length of stay. Higher AGD score remained significantly associated with longer length of stay on multivariable analysis (0.93 day increase per unit increase in AGD; 95% CI 0.15-1.71; p = 0.019). AGD was the only metric associated with increased risk of ICU admission (6.6 vs 5.0 geriatric deficits for those admitted vs not admitted to ICU; p = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is associated with increased length of hospital stay and ICU admission in older adults with HNC undergoing surgery. GA can be used to counsel patients on the expected postoperative course.",duplicate of 6791,,,

L., Han, H., Amaro, B., Cardenas-Goicoechea, J.",Oncologic outcomes in older women with endometrial carcinoma (≥70 years),"Data are limited in the management of elderly women with endometrial cancer as they are under-represented in clinical trials. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of women ≥70 years who underwent hysterectomy. One hundred and twenty-one patients met the inclusion criteria. The median age among the cohort was 75 years (range: 70-91), and 52% underwent robotic surgery. The five-year overall survival (OS) rate was 67%. The five-year cumulative incidence of recurrence was 19%. Based on univariate analysis, white race, lower ASA score, higher pre-operative and post-operative haematocrit, lower estimated blood loss, stage I and robotic surgery were associated with improved OS. On multivariable analysis, ASA score, preoperative haematocrit, estimated blood loss and stage were associated with survival.Survival rates among older women were low and disease recurrence was high. Robotic surgery was safe and appeared to improve perioperative outcomes in older women with endometrial cancer.Impact StatementWhat is already known on this subject? Endometrial cancer is the most common gynaecologic cancer with an overall survival above 90%. Surgery is the cornerstone of treatment. With an ageing population, an increased incidence of endometrial cancer is also expected. Increased frailty and comorbid conditions may prevent this population from undergoing surgery; consequently, these patients are often undertreated for a potentially curable disease.What do the results of this study add? Older women with endometrial cancer have low survival rates and high disease recurrence rates. Elderly women can tolerate robotic surgery to reduce the risk of adverse events.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? It is important to develop best practices to optimise patients for minimally invasive surgery. The benefits of robotic surgery may encourage patients and surgeons to partake in this approach. A multidisciplinary approach with geriatric evaluation may improve post-operative care and survival. Future clinical trials should include elderly women.",duplicate of 11206,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective database analysis was performed based on Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 2005 to 2014. Patients who underwent THA were included. Patient demographics, hospital characteristics, length of stay (LOS), total charges during hospitalization, in-hospital mortality, preoperative comorbidities, and perioperative complications were assessed. RESULTS: The general incidence of HAPUs after THA was 0.05%, with a fluctuating trend annually. Patients suffered from HAPUs were older, less likely through elective admission, more likely in large hospital, more usage of Medicare, and less possibly paying via Private insurance. Additionally, the occurrence of HAPUs was associated with more preoperative comorbidities, longer LOS, extra total charges, and higher in-hospital mortality. Risk factors associated with HAPUs included advanced age (≥75 years), large hospital, multiple comorbidities (n ≥ 3), diabetes with chronic complications, drug abuse, liver disease, fluid and electrolyte disorders, metastatic cancer, peripheral vascular disorders, psychoses, chronic renal failure, peptic ulcer disease, and weight loss. Besides, HAPUs were associated with inflammatory arthritis and femoral neck fracture (compared with primary/secondary osteoarthritis), frailty/senility, osteoporosis, acute renal failure, pneumonia, postoperative delirium, urinary tract infection, deep vein thrombosis, sepsis/septicemia, wound dehiscence/non-healing surgical wound, periprosthetic joint infection, and mechanical prosthesis-related complications. CONCLUSION: It is beneficial to study the risk factors associated with HAPUs after THA to ensure the preventive management and optimize outcomes although a low incidence was identified.",duplicate of 11458,,,

E.",Anesthetic Practice Trends and Perceptions Toward Postoperative Delirium: A Mixed-Methods Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Delirium is the most common postoperative complication in older adults, though anesthesiologist awareness of delirium prevention guidelines-and associated practice trends-remains unknown. METHODS: This was a convergent mixed-methods study, which simultaneously analyzed quantitative and qualitative data to determine delirium guideline awareness among anesthesiologists and practice patterns based on guideline recommendations. Quantitative data were abstracted from the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group database for noncardiac surgery patients (2009-2020) aged 65 years and older. Linear trends were reported for select guideline-based delirium prevention recommendations via regression modeling. Anesthesiologists (n = 40) from a major academic center without a structured delirium reduction program on hospital wards were then surveyed regarding knowledge and practices with respect to postoperative delirium. For qualitative data, 3 focus groups were held to further discuss guideline awareness and identify challenges with delirium prevention. RESULTS: Quantitative results demonstrated a significant decline in the proportion of cases with midazolam between 2009 and 2020, with the largest decrease observed with urologic surgeries (-3.9%/y; 95% confidence interval [CI], -4.2 to -3.6; P < .001). Use of regional anesthesia increased over this period, particularly with gynecologic surgeries (+2.3%/y; 95% CI, 1.2-3.4; P = .001). Anesthesiologist survey results revealed variable guideline awareness, as 21 of 39 (54%) respondents reported being aware of guidelines for anesthetic management of older adults. Importantly, unawareness of delirium management guidelines was the most frequently cited challenge (17 of 37, 46%) when caring for older adults. Finally, focus group participants were largely unaware of postoperative delirium guidelines. However, participants conveyed key barriers to delirium identification and prevention, including the unclear pathophysiology, nonmodifiable risk factors, and system-based hospital challenges. Participants also expressed a desire for decision-support systems, integrated within the perioperative workflow, that provide evidence-based recommendations for reducing delirium risk. CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative practice trends are indicative of an improving environment for postoperative delirium. However, delirium guideline awareness remains variable among anesthesiologists, and key barriers continue to exist for identifying and preventing postoperative delirium.",duplicate of 11318,,,

We retrospectively evaluated the results of a transaortic edge-to-edge mitral valve repair (Alfieri stitch) in high-risk patients who were undergoing aortic valve replacement. From February, 2012 to December, 2017, 43 patients underwent transaortic edge-to-edge mitral valve repair with concomitant aortic valve replacement at a single institution. Preoperative and postoperative echocardiograms were compared. Home telephone follow up was conducted and postoperative morbidity was examined, including the need for reoperation, stroke and cardiac arrhythmia. 30-day and long-term survival rates were also determined. Mitral regurgitation (MR) was graded semi-quantitatively as 0 (trace and/or none), mild (1), moderate (2) or moderate to severe (3-4). The patients were 74 ± 7.8 years old. 65% of the patients were male. Mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 115 ± 37 minutes and mean cross-clamp time was 71 ± 23 minutes. There was a significant improvement in preoperative vs postoperative median MR grade (2 (IQR 2-3) vs 0 (IQR 0-1); P = 0.05). Follow-up transthoracic echocardiograms in 29 patients obtained at a median of 9 months' (range 3 - 19 months') and in 16 patients at a median of 34 months' postoperatively (range 21 - 53 months') showed mild (1 (IQR 1-2)) grade of mitral regurgitation. 30-day survival was 98%. Long term survival at 12 and 24 months' were 88% and 81% respectively. Mitral valve reoperation was conducted in 1 patient (2%), who was suffering of endocarditis. Stroke occurred in 2 patients (7%). Cardiac arrhythmia was observed in 15 patients (35%). 8 patients (19%) suffered from atrial fibrillation and 7 patients (16%) displayed atrioventricular blockage. 10 patients (23%) could be treated conservatively and 5 patients (12%) needed implantation of a pacemaker. Transaortic edge-to-edge mitral valve repair can be safely performed during aortic valve replacement in high-risk patients and improves even long-term MR grade. Postoperative cardiac arrhythmia occurs frequently. 66% of them could be treated successfully by conservative procedures.",duplicate of 11300,,,

METHODS: Patients aged >90 years who had undergone abdominal aortic aneurysm repair from 2005 to 2017 were identified using procedure codes. Those with operative times <15 minutes were excluded. The demographics, preoperative comorbidities, and postoperative complications of those who had died by 30 days were compared with those of the patients alive at 30 days. RESULTS: A total of 1356 nonagenarians met the criteria: 1229 (90.6%) had undergone EVAR and 127 (9.4%) had undergone OSR. The overall 30-day mortality was 10.4%. The patients who had died within 30 days were significantly more likely to have undergone OSR than EVAR (40.9% vs 7.2%; P < .001). They also had a greater incidence of dependent functional status (22.0% for those who had died vs 8.1% for those alive at 30 days; P < .001), American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) classification of ≥4 (81.2% vs 18.8%; P < .001), perioperative blood transfusion (59.6% vs 20.3%; P < .001), postoperative pneumonia (12.1% vs 2.9%; P = .001), mechanical ventilation >48 hours (22.7% vs 2.6%; P < .001), and acute renal failure (12.1% vs 0.5%; P < .001). The EVAR group had a 30-day mortality rate of 2.6% in 1008 elective cases and 28.6% in 221 emergent cases. The OSR group had a 30-day mortality rate of 19.1% in 47 elective cases and 53.7% in 80 emergent cases. In the EVAR cohort, the 30-day mortality group had had a significantly greater incidence of dependent functional status (17% for those who had died vs 8% for those alive at 30 days; P = .004), ASA classification of ≥4 (76.4% vs 40.3%; P < .001), perioperative blood transfusion (57% vs 19%; P < .001), emergency surgery (71% vs 14%; P < .001), and longer operative times (150 vs 128 minutes; P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: Nonagenarians had an incrementally increased, but acceptable, risk of 30-day mortality with EVAR in elective and emergent cases compared with that reported for octogenarians and cohorts of patients not selected for age. We found greater mortality for patients with dependent status, a higher ASA classification, emergent repair, and OSR. These preoperative risk factors could help identify the best surgical candidates. Given these results, consideration for EVAR or OSR might be reasonable for highly selected patients, especially for elective patients with a larger abdominal aortic aneurysm diameter for whom the risk of rupture is higher.",duplicate of 10684,,,

METHODS: In this retrospective study, data from the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination database on 96,620 patients who had undergone cholecystectomy at 1060 hospitals from 2018 to 2020 were analyzed. Patients were divided into five age groups: < 75, 75-79, 80-84, 85-89, and ≥ 90 years. Associations between postoperative outcomes and age group were investigated by logistic regression analysis. Mean differences between age groups in time to postoperative recovery and cost were also compared. RESULTS: Older patients had higher rates of poor scores for activities of daily living and preoperative comorbidity. Compared with the youngest age group (< 75 years), the odds ratios for in-hospital mortality were 3.00 (95% confidence interval, 1.74-5.19), 7.54 (4.73-12.01), 13.47 (8.21-22.14), and 27.64 (15.56-49.09), in the 75-79, 80-84, 85-89, and ≥ 90-year-old age group, respectively (all p < 0.001).

METHODS: Preoperative frailty status was assessed by the G8 geriatric screening tool (G8 Score), Lee Schonberg prognostic index, Charlson Comorbidity index and American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status System in women older than 60 years with EC. Univariable and multivariable Cox-regression analyses, as well as Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed to determine the prognostic impact. Statistical analyses were adjusted for cancer entity-specific risk factors such as conventional histopathological tumor characteristics and relevant anamnestic life style parameters. RESULTS: 153 patients with all stages of EC who were operated at the University Medical Center Mainz between 2008 and 2019 were included. In multivariable analyses, only the G8 Score retained independent significance as a prognostic factor for disease-specific survival (DSS) (HR:4.58; 95% CI [1.35-15.51]) and overall survival (OS) (HR:2.89; 95% CI [1.31-6.39]. 92 patients (61.3%) were classified as G8-non-frail with a significantly increased DSS and OS rate compared to the 58 G8-frail patients (DSS:93.8% vs. 60.8%; p < 0.001 and OS:88.2% vs. 49.7%; p < 0.001; respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study demonstrates the substantial clinical and prognostic impact of the G8 Score on survival in elderly women with EC.

METHODS: A prospective study of women ≥60 years undergoing prolapse surgery at a large academic center. The primary outcome is positive Confusion Assessment Method delirium screen administered in person or by telephone at the time of hospital discharge and postoperative days 1, 3, 5, and 7. RESULTS: This analysis included 165 patients, mean ± SD age of 72.5 ± 6.1 years, with median (IQR) years of education of 13 (12-16), and baseline Modified Mini-Mental Status (3MS) Exam score of 95 (92-98). Prolapse repair type was vaginal for 70% (n=115) and laparoscopic for 30% (n=50) of patients; most under general anesthesia, 151 (92.1%). The incidence of positive delirium screen during the first week after surgery was 12.1% (n=20). Most of these participants screened positive on postoperative day 0, 8.4% (n=14). In univariate analyses, a positive screen was associated with older age and fewer education years, lower 3MS exam score, greater baseline geriatric depression scale score, and greater frailty score. Lower 3MS score was the only variable that remained significant in the final model (adjusted odds ratio 0.84, 95% CI 0.75-0.95). CONCLUSIONS: One in 12 women ≥60 years deemed eligible for discharge on the day of prolapse surgery screens positive for delirium.

Current treatment is based on revascularization to preserve the leg. In the older, hospitalized chronic limb threatening ischemia patient, delirium is a frequent and severe complication after revascularization. Delirium leads to an increased length of hospital stay, a higher mortality rate and a decrease in quality of life. Currently, no specific guidelines to prevent delirium in chronic limb threatening ischemia patients exist. We aim to evaluate the effect of a multicomponent, multidisciplinary prehabilitation program on the incidence of delirium in chronic limb threatening ischemia patients ≥65 years. DESIGN: A prospective observational cohort study to investigate the effects of the program on the incidence of delirium will be performed in a large teaching hospital in the Netherlands. This manuscript describes the design of the study and the content of this specific prehabilitation program. METHODS: Chronic limb threatening ischemia patients ≥65 years that require revascularization will participate in the program. This program focuses on optimizing the patient's overall health and includes delirium risk assessment, nutritional optimization, home-based physical therapy, iron infusion in case of anaemia and a comprehensive geriatric assessment in case of frailty. The primary outcome is the incidence of delirium. Secondary outcomes include quality of life, amputation-free survival, length of hospital stay and mortality. Exclusion criteria are the requirement of acute treatment or patients who are mentally incompetent to understand the procedures of the study or to complete questionnaires. A historical cohort from the same hospital is used as a control group. DISCUSSION: This study will clarify the effect of a prehabilitation program on delirium incidence in chronic limb threatening ischemia patients. New insights will be obtained on optimizing a patient's preoperative mental and physical condition to prevent postoperative complications, including delirium.

The circadian rhythm of melatonin secretion has been shown to be altered postoperatively. AIM OF THE STUDY: It was hypothesized that restoring normal sleeping patterns with a substance that is capable of resynchronizing circadian rhythm such as exogenous administration of melatonin may possibly reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This paper represents a prospective clinical observational study. Two consecutive groups of 250 consecutive patients took part in the study. Group A was the control group and group B was the melatonin group. In group B, the patients received prophylactic melatonin treatment. The main objectives were to observe the incidence of delirium, to identify any predictors of delirium, and to compare the two groups based on the delirium incidence. RESULTS: The incidence of delirium was 8.4% in the melatonin group vs. 20.8% in the control group (p = 0.001). Predictors of delirium in the melatonin group were age (p = 0.001) and higher EuroSCORE II value (p = 0.001). In multivariate analysis, age and EuroSCORE II value (p = 0.014) were predictors of postoperative delirium. Comparing the groups, the main predictors of delirium were age (p = 0.001), EuroSCORE II value (p = 0.001), cardio-pulmonary bypass (CPB) time (p = 0.001), aortic cross-clamping (ACC) time (p = 0.008), sufentanil dose (p = 0.001) and mechanical ventilation (p = 0.033).

Given the lack of large-scale data, we investigated associations between perioperative risk factors and postoperative delirium in arthroplasty surgery. METHODS: This retrospective population-based cohort study, utilized national claims data from the all-payer Premier Healthcare database containing detailed billing information from >25% nationwide hospitalizations. Patients undergoing elective total hip/knee arthroplasty surgery (2006-2016) were included.The primary outcome was postoperative delirium, while potential risk factors included age, gender, race, insurance type, and modifiable exposures including anesthesia type, opioid prescription dose (low/medium/high), benzodiazepines, meperidine, non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, ketamine, corticosteroids, and gabapentinoids. RESULTS: Among 1 694 795 patients' postoperative delirium was seen in 2.6% (14 785/564 226) of hip and 2.9% (32 384/1 130 569) of knee arthroplasties. Multivariable models revealed that the utilization of long acting (OR 2.10 CI 1.82 to 2.42), combined long/short acting benzodiazepines (OR 1.74 CI 1.56 to 1.94), and gabapentinoids (OR 1.26 CI 1.16 to 1.36) was associated with increased odds of postoperative delirium. Lower odds of postoperative delirium were seen for neuraxial versus general anesthesia (OR 0.81 CI 0.70 to 0.93) and with the utilization of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (OR 0.85 CI 0.79 to 0.91) as well as cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (OR 0.82 CI 0.77 to 0.89).

Given the lack of large-scale data, we investigated associations between perioperative risk factors and postoperative delirium in arthroplasty surgery. METHODS: This retrospective population-based cohort study, utilized national claims data from the all-payer Premier Healthcare database containing detailed billing information from >25% nationwide hospitalizations. Patients undergoing elective total hip/knee arthroplasty surgery (2006-2016) were included.The primary outcome was postoperative delirium, while potential risk factors included age, gender, race, insurance type, and modifiable exposures including anesthesia type, opioid prescription dose (low/medium/high), benzodiazepines, meperidine, non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, ketamine, corticosteroids, and gabapentinoids. RESULTS: Among 1 694 795 patients' postoperative delirium was seen in 2.6% (14 785/564 226) of hip and 2.9% (32 384/1 130 569) of knee arthroplasties. Multivariable models revealed that the utilization of long acting (OR 2.10 CI 1.82 to 2.42), combined long/short acting benzodiazepines (OR 1.74 CI 1.56 to 1.94), and gabapentinoids (OR 1.26 CI 1.16 to 1.36) was associated with increased odds of postoperative delirium. Lower odds of postoperative delirium were seen for neuraxial versus general anesthesia (OR 0.81 CI 0.70 to 0.93) and with the utilization of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (OR 0.85 CI 0.79 to 0.91) as well as cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (OR 0.82 CI 0.77 to 0.89).

No study has evaluated the effects of gabapentin on acute, postoperative pain in patients undergoing surgery for brachial plexus injuries. In this preliminary study, we evaluated gabapentin as preemptive analgesic for intraoperative period and during the acute postoperative period at rest and during movement. Twenty consecutive adult patients undergoing surgery for brachial plexus injury were enrolled for the study. Patients randomly received either oral gabapentin 800 mg or placebo capsules 2 hours before surgery. General anesthesia was induced and maintained with propofol, at bispectral index value between 40 and 60. Intraoperative fentanyl and propofol requirements were noted. Postoperatively, all patients were alert and pain was assessed using visual analog scale (VAS) for 24 hours, both during rest and movement. Whenever VAS score was more than 50 or on patients' demand, ketorolac 30 mg was given as rescue analgesic. The demographics, duration of surgery, and propofol consumption in both groups were comparable. Intraoperative and postoperative heart rate and mean blood pressure were also comparable. Significant difference was noted in intraoperative fentanyl consumption (P=0.03), total dose of rescue analgesic (P=0.004), and VAS score at rest and movement, between the 2 groups; less in gabapentin group as compared with placebo group (P=0.01 and 0.04, at rest and movement, respectively).

In this study, we investigated the incidence and risk factors of POD in 224 patients older than 70 years of age, who had undergone a neurosurgical operation in the last two years. Methods: Data related to preoperative factors (male gender, >70 years, previous dementia or delirium, alcohol abuse, serum levels of sodium, potassium and glucose, and co-morbidities), perioperative factors (type of surgery and anesthesia, and duration of surgery) and postoperative data (length of stay in recovery room, severity of pain and use of opioid analgesics) were retrospectively collected and statistically analyzed. Results: POD appeared in 48 patients (21.4%) by postoperative day 3. When we excluded 26 patients with previous dementia or delirium, 17 spontaneously recovered by postoperative day 14, while 5 patients recovered by postoperative 2 months with medication, among 22 patients with newly developed POD. The univariate risk factors for POD included previously dementic or delirious patients, abnormal preoperative serum glucose level, pre-existent diabetes, the use of local anesthesia for the operation, longer operation time (>3.2 hr) or recovery room stay (>90 min), and severe pain (VAS>6.8) requiring opioid treatment (p<0.05). Backward regression analysis revealed that previously dementic patients with diabetes, the operation being performed under local anesthesia, and severe postoperative pain treated with opioids were independent risk factors for POD. Conclusion: Our study shows that control of blood glucose levels and management of pain during local anesthesia and in the immediate postoperative period can reduce unexpected POD and help preventing unexpected medicolegal problems and economic burdens.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 14172,Gabapentin,,

Aims: This article aimed to evaluate the evidence for varied techniques described for peri-operative pain management in breast surgery, and to review the literature on chronic pain after breast surgery and particularly 'post-mastectomy pain syndrome'. Method: A Pubmed search was performed, with the key words ""mastectomy"" and ""pain"" for articles in the English language in the adult human population (age > 19 years), looking specifically for different analgesic techniques that have been evaluated. Results: Thirty-three peer-reviewed publications with pain outcome data were included, ranging from 15 to 289 patients per study (total n = 2104). Twenty three were randomised controlled trials and the rest were prospective or retrospective audits and case series. Inconsistent trial methodology precluded a meta-analysis. Paravertebral local anaesthetic nerve blockade resulted in lower pain scores and fewer side effects than opioid-based regimens. Three risk factors emerged predicting chronic pain post-mastectomy: higher post-operative pain scores, age <65 years and inclusion of major reconstructive surgery. Conclusion: Paravertebral block should be considered for use in major breast surgery.

With the use of antihyperalgesic drugs as premedication, central sensitization is inhibited and postoperative pain reduced. Since only few studies have used a combination of these drugs; we decided to use a new combination- gabapentin and etoricoxib and compared it with a routinely used premedication in our hospital. Patients & Methods : A prospective, randomized, single blind study to compare two drug combinations, gabapentin and etoricoxib (GE) with pethidine and promethazine (PP) used as premedication. Sixty patients posted for major orthopedic procedures under general anesthesia, were randomly allocated in equal number to receive a combination of oral gabapentin 600 mg and etoricoxib 120 mg or pethidine 1mg kg-1 and promethazine 0.5 mg kg-1 intramuscularly two hours before the surgery. Intraoperative analgesia was provided with fentanyl. Post surgery, observations were made every hour for 6 hours and then at 12 and 24 hours to assess the pain score, sedation score, timing when the first dose of the rescue analgesic was demanded and its total dose required and side effects in the two groups. Results: Group GE had significantly lower intraoperative heart rate, mean blood pressure and fentanyl consumption, lower post operative pain scores, longer time till demand and lower total dose of rescue analgesic required post operatively as compared to group PP.

I.",Pregabalin as an adjunct to a multimodal analgesic regimen to achieve opioid sparing in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair,"Background: Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair of the shoulder is associated with a significant amount of pain, especially the first 36-48 postoperative hours [1]. Previous studies have demonstrated that an interscalene block is an effective analgesic technique for shoulder surgery [2-5]. However, even with the use of a long-acting local anesthetic, the analgesic effect of a single injection is limited to the first 6 to 12 hours [6]. Our objective was to determine the value of pregabalin as an opioid-sparing adjunct when used in combination with regional anesthesia techniques. Methods: We prospectively studied 50 patients undergoing primary arthroscopic rotator cuff repair under general anesthesia. Patients received a single-injection interscalene brachial plexus block with 30 mL of 0.5% ropivacaine, and oral celecoxib 200 mg and acetaminophen 500 mg. The patients were provided with a prescription for oral oxycodone 5 mg and acetaminophen 325 mg, 1-2 tablets every 4-6 hours as needed for postoperative supplemental analgesia. Patients were randomized to receive pregabalin (150 mg, twice daily, administered orally) or a placebo. The primary end point of the study was total opioid (oxycodone) consumption in the first 48 postoperative hours. Secondary end points included pain (evaluated with a 0-10 numeric rating scale anchored with 0 as .no pain. and 10 as .worst pain imaginable.), opioid- and pregabalin-related adverse effects, and duration of hospitalization. Results: Median opioid consumption during the first 48 postoperative hours was 51 mg (standard deviation [SD]: 40, interquartile range [IQR], 23-80 mg) in the pregabalin group and 64 mg (SD: 41, IQR: 35-90) in the placebo group (p = 0.26). Pain scores, adverse effects, and other secondary end points were similar between the groups. Conclusions: Pregabalin, at the dosage used in this study, resulted in a minimal or negligible decrease in opioid consumption when used as an adjunct to a multimodal, regional, analgesic regimen. The apparently lack of additive analgesia effect of pregabalin in this setting may be explained by the analgesic effects of the oral analgesics that were administered postoperatively. These nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics may have masked the pregabalin-induced analgesia by preventing postoperative central sensitization.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 13790,Gabapentin,,

AIMS: The present study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of gabapentin on the incidence of fasciculation and succinylcholine-induced myalgia. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: The study was conducted at a tertiary care teaching hospital in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled manner. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients of both genders undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomly assigned to two groups. Patients in Group I (Gabapentin group) received 600 mg of gabapentin orally 2 h prior to surgery and patients in Group II (placebo group) received matching placebo. Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl 3 μg/kg, thiopentone 3-5 mg/kg and succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg. All patients were observed and graded for fasciculations by a blinded observer and patients were intubated. Anesthesia was maintained with oxygen in air, sevoflurane and intermittent vecuronium bromide. After completion of surgery, neuromuscular blockade was reversed. A blinded observer recorded myalgia grade at 24 h. Patients were provided patient-controlled analgesia with fentanyl for postoperative pain relief.

We hypothesized that as a component of multimodal analgesia, local infiltration analgesia followed by continuous infusion of ropivacaine would result in reduced postoperative opioid consumption and lower pain scores compared with infiltration alone, and that both of these techniques would be superior to placebo. METHODS: In this prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 105 patients were randomized into three groups: Group I, in which patients received infiltration with ropivacaine, ketorolac, and adrenaline followed by continuous infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine at 5 mL/hr; Group II, in which patients received infiltration with ropivacaine, ketorolac, and adrenaline followed by continuous infusion of saline solution at 5 mL/hr; and Group III, in which patients received infiltration with saline solution followed by continuous infusion of saline solution at 5 mL/hr.All patients received celecoxib, pregabalin, and acetaminophen perioperatively and patient-controlled analgesia; surgery was performed under general anesthesia. Before wound closure, the tissues and periarticular space were infiltrated with ropivacaine, ketorolac, and adrenaline or saline solution and a fenestrated catheter was placed. The catheter was attached to a pump prefilled with either 0.2% ropivacaine or saline solution set to infuse at 5 mL/hr.The primary outcome measure was postoperative opioid consumption and the secondary outcome measures were pain scores, adverse side effects, and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: There were no differences between groups in the administration of opioids in the operating room, in the recovery room, or on the surgical floor. The pain scores on recovery room admission and discharge and the floor were low and similar between groups. There were no differences in the incidence of adverse side effects among groups. Patient satisfaction with pain management was similar in all groups.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare the analgesic efficacy, adverse effects, and clinical utility of gabapentin and pregabalin in postoperative pain management, long-term functional outcome, and quality of life in patients undergoing spinal surgery. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Patient outcome after lumbar discectomy for radicular low back pain is variable and the benefit is inconsistent. The most common persistent symptoms are pain, motor deficit, and decreased functional status. METHODS: This study was conducted in 90 patients belonging to the 18 to 75 age group of either sex undergoing spinal surgery under general anesthesia. Group A received 300 mg of gabapentin, group B received 75 mg of pregabalin, whereas group C received placebo 1 dose 1 hour before surgery and 8 hourly for 7 days, thereafter. The outcome of postoperative static and dynamic pain and functional outcome was recorded using 3 questionnaires-visual analogue scale, Prolo functional and economic score, Oswestry Disability Index score from preoperative period to 3 months postoperatively. RESULTS: Among the 3 groups, subjects receiving pregabalin showed consistently reduced static and dynamic pain intensity and also required lesser amount of rescue drug throughout the postoperative period. There was statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) in the Prolo score and Oswestry Disability Index score at all time intervals between group B and group C. Although, significant difference in the functional outcome between group A and group B was seen at 3 months. CONCLUSION: Preoperative pregabalin administration is associated with less pain intensity and improved functional outcomes 3 months after lumbar discectomy followed by gabapentin and then placebo.

K., Amirault, D.",Multimodal Pain Management in Older Elective Arthroplasty Patients,"Background: Pain management after elective arthroplasty in older adults is complicated due to the risk of undertreatment of postoperative pain and potential adverse effects from analgesics, notably opioids. Using combinations of analgesics has been proposed as potentially beneficial to achieve pain control with lower opioid doses. Objective: We compared a multimodal pain protocol with a traditional one, in older elective arthroplasty patients, measuring self-rated pain, incidence of postoperative delirium, quantity and cost of opioid analgesics consumed. Methods: One hundred fifty-eight patients, 70 years and older, admitted to tertiary care for elective arthroplasty were prospectively assessed postoperative days 1–3. Patients received either traditional postoperative analgesia (acetaminophen plus opioids) or a multimodal pain protocol (acetaminophen, opioids, gabapentin, celecoxib), depending on surgeon preference. Self-rated pain, postoperative delirium, and time to achieve standby-assist ambulation were compared, as were total opioid doses and analgesic costs. Results: Despite receiving significantly more opioid analgesics (traditional: 166.4 mg morphine-equivalents; multimodal: 442 mg morphine equivalents; t = 10.64, P <.0001), there was no difference in self-rated pain, delirium, or mobility on postoperative days 1–3. Costs were significantly higher in the multimodal group (t = 9.15, P <.0001). Knee arthroplasty was associated with higher pain scores than hip arthroplasty, with no significant difference in opioid usage. Conclusion: A multimodal approach to pain control demonstrated no benefit over traditional postoperative analgesia in elective arthroplasty patients, but with significantly higher amounts of opioid consumed. This poses a potential risk regarding tolerability in frail older adults and results in increased drug costs.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 5548,Gabapentin,,

We designed a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm, double-blinded trial to determine whether perioperative administration of gabapentin reduced postoperative delirium after noncardiac surgery. METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (N = 347) or gabapentin 900 mg (N = 350) administered preoperatively and for the first 3 postoperative days. The primary outcome was postoperative delirium as measured by the Confusion Assessment Method. Secondary outcomes were postoperative pain, opioid use, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Data for 697 patients were included, with a mean ± SD age of 72 ± 6 yr. The overall incidence of postoperative delirium in any of the first 3 days was 22.4% (24.0% in the gabapentin and 20.8% in the placebo groups; the difference was 3.20%; 95% CI, 3.22% to 9.72%; P = 0.30). The incidence of delirium did not differ between the two groups when stratified by surgery type, anesthesia type, or preoperative risk status. Gabapentin was shown to be opioid sparing, with lower doses for the intervention group versus the control group. For example, the morphine equivalents for the gabapentin-treated group, median 6.7 mg (25th, 75th quartiles: 1.3, 20.0 mg), versus control group, median 6.7 mg (25th, 75th quartiles: 2.7, 24.8 mg), differed on the first postoperative day (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Although postoperative opioid use was reduced, perioperative administration of gabapentin did not result in a reduction of postoperative delirium or hospital length of stay.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 2730,Gabapentin,,

N.",Pattern of perioperative gabapentinoid use and risk for postoperative naloxone administration,"Background: Single preoperative gabapentinoid (gabapentin and pregabalin) administration has been associated with respiratory depression during Phase I anaesthesia recovery. In this study, we assess for associations between chronic (home) use and perioperative administration (preoperative and postoperative) of gabapentinoids, and risk for severe over-sedation or respiratory depression as inferred from the use of naloxone. Methods: From 2011 to 2016, we identified patients undergoing general anaesthesia discharged to standard postoperative wards and administered naloxone within 48 h of surgery in a single centre. These patients were 2:1 matched on age, sex, and type of procedure. Patient and perioperative characteristics were abstracted and compared to assess for risk for naloxone administration. Results: We identified 128 patients that received naloxone after operation [odds ratio 1.2; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0, 1.4 per 1000 general anaesthetics]. Patients on chronic or postoperative gabapentinoid therapy were at significantly higher risk for receiving naloxone after operation. Multivariable analysis detected significant interactions between chronic and postoperative use of gabapentinoids, where continuation of chronic gabapentinoid medications into the postoperative period was associated with an increased rate of naloxone administration (6.30, 95% CI 2.4, 16.7; P=0.001). Obstructive sleep apnoea (P=0.005) and preoperative disability (P=0.003) were also associated with an increased risk for postoperative naloxone administration. Patients who received naloxone had longer hospital stays and higher rates of postoperative delirium. Conclusions: Continuation of chronic gabapentinoid medications into the postoperative period is associated with the increased use of naloxone to reverse over-sedation or respiratory depression. Such patients requiring this therapy warrant high levels of postoperative monitoring.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3151,Gabapentin,,

Attempts at using only neuraxial anesthesia for major abdominal surgery have often been shown to be poorly effective. This report demonstrates that laparoscopic colonic surgical procedures can be performed with ultrasound-guided blocks (bilateral transversus abdominal plane block and celiac plexus block) and intravenous sedation, while avoiding general or neuraxial anesthesia. Case Report We report our preliminary experience in 3 patients (all American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status III) who underwent laparoscopic colonic surgery without general anesthesia. Intraoperative visceral analgesia was provided by single-injection ultrasound anterior celiac plexus block to which was added a bilateral subcostal transversus abdominal plane block to obtain parietal analgesia. Light intravenous sedation was added. Surgical exposure was satisfactory, and no patient complained of any symptom during the procedure. No adverse effect was recorded. Postoperative pain was minimal, and recovery was enhanced with mobilization and walking within hours after surgery. Patient satisfaction was excellent. Conclusions To date, celiac plexus block has been used almost exclusively to relieve pancreatic cancer pain. This is the first report in which it is shown that major intra-abdominal surgery can be performed almost exclusively with regional anesthesia while avoiding adverse effects and problems associated with either general or neuraxial anesthesia. In addition, prolonged postoperative pain relief facilitated early recovery.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 15652,Gabapentin,,

Objective: To identify patient clusters based on acute pain trajectories, preoperative psychosocial characteristics associated with the high-risk cluster, and the best acute pain predictor of remote outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: A secondary analysis of the Stanford Accelerated Recovery Trial randomized, double-blind clinical trial was conducted at a single-center, tertiary, referral teaching hospital. A total of 422 participants scheduled for thoracotomy, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, total hip replacement, total knee replacement, mastectomy, breast lumpectomy, hand surgery, carpal tunnel surgery, knee arthroscopy, shoulder arthroplasty, or shoulder arthroscopy were enrolled between May 25, 2010, and July 25, 2014. Data analysis was performed from January 1 to August 1, 2018. Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive gabapentin (1200 mg, preoperatively, and 600 mg, 3 times a day postoperatively) or active placebo (lorazepam, 0.5 mg preoperatively, inactive placebo postoperatively) for 72 hours. Main Outcomes and Measures: A modified Brief Pain Inventory prospectively captured 3 surgical site pain outcomes: average pain and worst pain intensity over the past 24 hours, and current pain intensity. Within each category, acute pain trajectories (first 10 postoperative pain scores) were compared using a k-means clustering algorithm. Fifteen descriptors of acute pain were compared as predictors of remote postoperative pain resolution, opioid cessation, and full recovery. Results: Of the 422 patients enrolled, 371 patients (≤10% missing pain scores) were included in the analysis. Of these, 146 (39.4%) were men; mean (SD) age was 56.67 (11.70) years. Two clusters were identified within each trajectory category. The high pain cluster of the average pain trajectory significantly predicted prolonged pain (hazard ratio [HR], 0.63; 95% CI, 0.50-0.80; P < .001) and delayed opioid cessation (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.41-0.67; P < .001) but was not a predictor of time to recovery in Cox proportional hazards regression (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.69-1.14; P = .89). Preoperative risk factors for categorization to the high average pain cluster included female sex (adjusted relative risk [ARR], 1.36; 95% CI, 1.08-1.70; P = .008), elevated preoperative pain (ARR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.07-1.15; P < .001), a history of alcohol or drug abuse treatment (ARR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.42-2.53; P < .001), and receiving active placebo (ARR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.03-1.56; P = .03). Worst pain reported on postoperative day 10 was the best predictor of time to pain resolution (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.78-0.87; P < .001), opioid cessation (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.80-0.89; P < .001), and complete surgical recovery (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.86-0.96; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: This study has shown a possible uniform predictor of remote postoperative pain, opioid use, and recovery that can be easily assessed.

Once delirium occurs, interventions have little effect on severity or duration, emphasizing the importance of primary prevention. This review provides an overview of interventions to prevent postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing elective surgery. Methods: A literature search was conducted in March 2018. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and before-and-after studies on interventions with potential effects on postoperative delirium in elderly surgical patients were included. Acute admission, planned ICU admission, and cardiac patients were excluded. Full texts were reviewed, and quality was assessed by two independent reviewers. Primary outcome was the incidence of delirium. Secondary outcomes were severity and duration of delirium. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) were calculated for incidences of delirium where similar intervention techniques were used. Results: Thirty-one RCTs and four before-and-after studies were included for analysis. In 19 studies, intervention decreased the incidences of postoperative delirium. Severity was reduced in three out of nine studies which reported severity of delirium. Duration was reduced in three out of six studies. Pooled analysis showed a significant reduction in delirium incidence for dexmedetomidine treatment, and bispectral index (BIS)-guided anaesthesia. Based on sensitivity analyses, by leaving out studies with a high risk of bias, multicomponent interventions and antipsychotics can also significantly reduce the incidence of delirium. Conclusion: Multicomponent interventions, the use of antipsychotics, BIS-guidance, and dexmedetomidine treatment can successfully reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing elective, non-cardiac surgery. However, present studies are heterogeneous, and high-quality studies are scarce. Future studies should add these preventive methods to already existing multimodal and multidisciplinary interventions to tackle as many precipitating factors as possible, starting in the pre-admission period.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 4968,Gabapentin,,

We compared spinal mepivacaine vs bupivacaine for postoperative neurologic function in patients undergoing primary TKA. Methods: Thirty-two patients undergoing primary TKA were enrolled. Primary outcome measure was return of motor and sensory function. Secondary outcome measures included assessment of urinary function, pain via visual analog scale (VAS) scores, opioid usage, distance walked and pain with physical therapy, time to discharge readiness, and complications. Results: Patients with mepivacaine spinal anesthetic had faster return of sensory function (164 ± 38.6 vs 212 ± 54.2 minutes, P = .015), return of motor function (153 ± 47.4 vs 200 ± 45.2 minutes, P = .025), and time to straight leg raise (148 ± 43.5 vs 194 ± 50.8 minutes, P = .023). The mepivacaine group experienced significantly fewer episodes of urinary retention and shorter time to urination (344 ± 154.4 vs 416 ± 96.3 minutes, P = .039). Patients exhibited slightly higher VAS pain scores in the postanesthesia care unit (1.0 ± 1.7 vs 2.7 ± 2.3, P = .046) with no difference in opioid consumption. There were no differences in VAS scores or opioid use on the inpatient ward. Patients achieved discharge readiness 71 minutes faster in the mepivacaine group. There was no need to convert to general anesthesia or transient nerve symptoms in either group.

However, the severity and impact of postoperative pain varies markedly amongst individuals, making the identification of patients who would benefit most from TRA a potentially important step toward personalised perioperative care. Methods: In this prospective observational study, mastectomy patients (n=122) were recruited and systematically assessed for psychosocial characteristics including pain catastrophising before surgery, and either received preoperative TRA (n=57) or no block (n=65). Results: Age, baseline pain, and psychosocial traits did not differ between these groups. TRA was associated with lower overall pain scores and opioid consumption perioperatively, with a larger proportion of patients without block (50% vs 28%) reporting moderate-severe pain (more than three/10) on the day of surgery. Mixed model analysis of variance revealed a significant interaction between catastrophising and TRA, such that amongst patients with high baseline catastrophising, TRA was associated with substantially lower pain severity score (58% lower), while amongst patients with low baseline catastrophising, TRA was associated with only 18% lower pain severity. At 2 weeks, this interaction between baseline catastrophising and TRA was also observed when examining surgical pain burden, with higher baseline catastrophising patients who had received TRA reporting lower pain and less frequent opioid use (40% vs 70% of patients). Conclusions: TRA provided immediate analgesic benefit for patients undergoing mastectomy on the day of surgery, but this effect appeared more pronounced and sustained amongst patients with higher baseline catastrophising.

OBJECTIVE: Given the lack of large-scale data on the use and efficacy of multimodal analgesia in spine fusion surgery, we conducted a population-based analysis utilizing the nationwide claims-based Premier Healthcare database. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Multimodal analgesia, combining different pain signaling pathways to achieve additive and synergistic effects, is increasingly emerging as the standard of care. METHODS: Cases of posterior lumbar fusion surgery were extracted (2006-2016). Opioid-only analgesia was compared to multimodal analgesia, that is, systemic opioid analgesia + either acetaminophen, steroids, gabapentinoids, ketamine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, or neuraxial anesthesia (categorized into 1, 2, or >2 additional analgesic modes). Mixed-effects models measured associations between multimodal analgesia categories and outcomes, including opioid prescription dose, cost/length of hospitalization, and opioid-related complications. Odds ratios (ORs, or % change) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are reported. RESULTS: Among 265,538 patients the incidence of multimodal analgesia was 61.1% (162,156); multimodal pain management-specifically when adding NSAIDs/COX-2 inhibitors to opioids-was associated with reduced opioid prescription (-13.3% CI -16.7 to -9.7%), cost (-2.9% CI -3.9 to -1.8%) and length of hospitalization (-7.3% CI -8.5 to -6.1%). Multimodal analgesia in general was associated with stepwise decreased odds for gastrointestinal complications (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.88-1.04; OR 0.84, CI 0.75-0.95; OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64-0.96), whereas odds were increased for postoperative delirium (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.00-1.32; OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.11-1.59; OR 1.31, 95% CI 0.99-1.74), and counterintuitively- naloxone administration (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.13-1.38; OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.37-1.77; OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.52-2.23) with increasing analgesic modes used: one, two, or more additional analgesic modes, respectively. Post-hoc analysis revealed that specifically gabapentinoid use increased odds of naloxone requirement by about 50%, regardless of concurrent opioid dose (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Although multimodal analgesia was not consistently implemented in spine fusion surgery, particularly NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors demonstrated opioid sparing effects. Moreover, results suggest a synergistic interaction between gabapentinoids and opioids, the former potentiating opioid effects resulting in greater naloxone requirement.

This study aimed to determine whether similar or discordant preoperative factors were associated with the duration of postoperative pain and opioid use. Methods: In this post hoc analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of perioperative gabapentin vs active placebo, 410 patients aged 18–75 years, undergoing diverse operations underwent preoperative assessments of pain, opioid use, substance use, and psycho-social variables. After surgery, a modified Brief Pain Inventory was administered over the phone daily up to 3 months, weekly up to 6 months, and monthly up to 2 years after surgery. Pain and opioid cessation were defined as the first of 5 consecutive days of 0 out of 10 pain or no opioid use, respectively. Results: Overall, 36.1%, 19.8%, and 9.5% of patients continued to report pain, and 9.5%, 2.4%, and 1.7% reported continued opioid use at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. Preoperative pain at the future surgical site (every 1-point increase in the Numeric Pain Rating Scale; HR 0.93; 95% CI 0.87–1.00; P=0.034), trait anxiety (every 10-point increase in the Trait Anxiety Inventory; HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.68–0.92; P=0.002), and a history of delayed recovery after injury (HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.40–0.96; P=0.034) were associated with delayed pain cessation. Preoperative opioid use (HR 0.60; 95% CI 0.39–0.92; P=0.020), elevated depressive symptoms (every 5-point increase in the Beck Depression Inventory-II score; HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.80–0.98; P=0.017), and preoperative pain outside of the surgical site (HR 0.94; 95% CI 0.89–1.00; P=0.046) were associated with delayed opioid cessation, while perioperative gabapentin promoted opioid cessation (HR 1.37; 95% CI 1.06–1.77; P=0.016).

J.",The Impact of Music and Noise-Cancellation on Sedation Requirements During Total Knee Replacement: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background: Music has emerged as a well-received medical intervention. Patients may be uncomfortable during total joint replacement, which can result in high sedation requirements. These requirements place elderly patients at risk for delirium. This study compares the effect of noise-cancellation versus music medicine on sedation requirements, pain, and opioid consumption during elective total knee replacement. Methods: This prospective, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial was conducted at Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center between July 2018 and July 2019. All participants underwent primary total knee arthroplasty with a combined spinal-epidural as their primary anesthetic and received noise-cancelling, wireless headphones. Patients in the control group received the noise-cancellation feature only, while patients in the experimental group were permitted to listen to music of their choice. Patients signaled a request for sedation by squeezing a noise-making rubber hippopotamus toy. The primary outcomes included whether sedation was requested by the participant, the number of sedation demand doses requested, and the amount of propofol sedation administered during the procedure. Secondary outcomes included postoperative pain scores, total opioid consumption, and time to first opioid request. Results: Seventy-one percent (n = 36) of patients agreed to participate in the study. Forty-four percent of participants in the noise-cancellation group and 19% of participants in the music group requested sedation (P =.25). The median propofol consumption was not different between groups (0 [0-6.7] µg/kg/min vs 0 [0-0] µg/kg/min, P =.101 for noise cancellation vs music, respectively). Pain scores and opioid consumption were not different between groups. Discussion: To date, this is the first study to use Bluetooth communication, noise-cancellation, and an Internet-based music streaming service to determine whether this technology has an impact on outcomes during major orthopedic surgery. Conclusion: As an isolated intervention, the benefits of music in a complex operating room environment may be overstated. However, music integration with noise-reduction technology and patient-controlled sedation may lead to a safer and more satisfying anesthetic. More research is needed to determine the nonpharmacologic interventions that will produce positive outcomes for the geriatric population.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 13358,Gabapentin,,

T.",Impact of anesthesia technique on post-operative opioid use in open gynecologic surgery in an enhanced recovery after surgery pathway,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of anesthesia technique in an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathway on post-operative opioid use. METHODS: Patients undergoing open gynecologic surgery under an ERAS pathway from November 2014 through December 2018 were included retrospectively. All patients received pre-operative analgesia consisting of oral acetaminophen, pregabalin, celecoxib, and tramadol extended release, unless contraindicated. Patients received local wound infiltration with bupivacaine; the post-operative analgesic regimen was standardized. Patients were categorized by anesthesia technique: (1) inhalational, (2) total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), and (3) combined technique. The primary outcome was post-operative opioid consumption measured as morphine equivalent dose, recorded as the total opioid dose received post-operatively, including doses received through post-operative day 3. RESULTS: A total of 1184 patients underwent general anesthesia using either inhalational (386, 33%), TIVA (349, 29%), or combined (449, 38%) techniques. Patients who received combined anesthesia had longer surgery times (p=0.005) and surgical complexity was higher among patients who underwent TIVA (moderate/higher in 76 patients, 38%) compared with those who received inhaled anesthesia (intermediate/higher in 41 patients, 23%) or combined anesthesia (intermediate/higher in 72 patients, 30%). Patients who underwent TIVA anesthesia consumed less post-operative opioids than those managed with inhalational technique (0 (0-46.3) vs 10 (0-72.5), p=0.009) or combined anesthesia (0 (0-46.3) vs 10 (0-87.5), p=0.029). Similarly, patients who underwent the combined technique had similar opioid consumption post-operatively compared with those who received inhalational anesthesia (10 (0-87.5) vs 10 (0-72.5), p=0.34). CONCLUSIONS: TIVA technique is associated with a decrease in post-operative consumption of opioids after open gynecologic surgery in patients on an ERAS pathway.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 8469,Gabapentin,,

This secondary analysis aimed to investigate the effects of anesthesia (spinal vs. general) and tourniquet use on persistent pain after total knee arthroplasty. Methods: In this secondary analysis of a previously presented parallel, single-center, randomized trial, 404 patients scheduled for total knee arthroplasty were randomized to spinal versus general anesthesia and no-Tourniquet versus tourniquet groups. Patients assessed pain using the Brief Pain Inventory-short form preoperatively and 3 and 12 months postoperatively. The prespecified main outcome was the change in ""average pain"" measured with numerical 0 to 10 rating scale 1 yr postoperatively. The threshold for clinical importance between groups was set to 1.0. Results: The change in average pain scores 1 yr postoperatively did not differ between the spinal and general anesthesia groups (-2.6 [SD 2.5] vs.-2.3 [SD 2.5], respectively; mean difference,-0.4; 95% CI,-0.9 to 0.1; P = 0.150). The no-Tourniquet group reported a smaller decrease in the average pain scores than the tourniquet group (-2.1 [SD 2.7] vs.-2.8 [SD 2.3]; mean difference, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.1 to 1.1; P = 0.012). After 1 yr, the scores concerning the mean of four pain severity variables (numerical rating scale) decreased more in the spinal than in the general anesthesia group (-2.3 [SD 2.2] vs.-1.8 [SD 2.1]; mean difference,-0.5; 95% CI,-0.9 to-0.05; P = 0.029) and less in the no-Tourniquet than in the tourniquet group (-1.7 [SD 2.3] vs.-2.3 [SD 2.0]; mean difference, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.2 to 1.0; P = 0.005). None of the differences in pain scores reached the threshold for clinical importance. Conclusions: The type of anesthesia (spinal vs. general) or tourniquet use has no clinically important effect on persistent postsurgical pain after total knee arthroplasty.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 587,Gabapentin,,

Design: Retrospective hospital registry study. Setting: Tertiary referral center (Boston, MA). Patients: 111,008 adult non-emergency, non-cardiac surgical patients between 2014 and 2018. Interventions: Preoperative administration of gabapentinoids (gabapentin or pregabalin). Measurements: We tested the primary hypothesis that preoperative gabapentinoid use was associated with lower odds of hospital readmission within 30 days. Contingent on this hypothesis, we examined whether lower intraoperative opioid utilization mediated this effect. Secondary outcome was postoperative respiratory complications. Main results: Gabapentinoid administration was associated with lower odds of readmission (adjusted odds ratio [ORadj] 0.80 [95% CI, 0.75–0.85]; p < 0.001). This effect was in part mediated by lower intraoperative opioid utilization in patients receiving gabapentinoids (8.2% [2.4–11.5%]; p = 0.012). Readmissions for gastrointestinal disorders (ORadj 0.74 [0.60–0.90]; p = 0.003), neuro-psychiatric complications (ORadj 0.66 [0.49–0.87]; p = 0.004), non-surgical site infections (ORadj 0.68 [0.52–0.88; p = 0.004) and trauma or poisoning (ORadj 0.25 [0.16–0.41]; p < 0.001) occurred less frequently in patients receiving gabapentinoids. The risk of postoperative respiratory complications was lower in patients receiving gabapentinoids (ORadj 0.77 [0.70–0.85]; p < 0.001). Lower doses of pregabalin (< 75 mg) and gabapentin (< 300 mg) compared to both, no and high-dose administration of gabapentinoids, were associated with a lower risk of postoperative respiratory complications (ORadj 0.61 [0.50–0.75]; p < 0.001 and ORadj 0.70 [0.53–0.92]; p = 0.012, respectively). These lower gabapentinoid doses prevented 30-day readmission (ORadj 0.74 [0.65–0.85]; p < 0.001). The results were robust in several sensitivity analyses including surgical procedure defined subgroups and patients undergoing ambulatory surgery. Conclusions: The preoperative use of pregabalin and gabapentin, up to doses of 75 and 300 mg respectively, mitigates the risks of hospital readmission and postoperative respiratory complications which can in part be explained by lower intraoperative opioid use. Further research is warranted to elucidate mechanisms of the preventive action. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16273,Gabapentin,,

This study’s main objective was to evaluate the efficacy of the bilateral ultrasound-guided erector spinae plane block (US-ESPB) as a method for perioperative pain management in patients undergoing lumbar spine surgeries. Methods: This double-blinded prospective randomised controlled study was conducted on 140 patients aged between 18 and 65 years; all were scheduled for elective lumbar spine surgeries. Patients were randomly allocated into one of the two groups: the ESPB group (n = 70) or the control group (n = 70). All patients received bilateral US-ESPB after induction of general anaesthesia, in the ESPB group; 20 mL of levobupivacaine 0.25% were used, while 20 mL normal saline was given to the control group instead. The primary endpoint was the total amount of morphine consumed during the intraoperative and the first 24 postoperative hours. Secondary endpoints included, time to first request of rescue analgesia as well as incidence of adverse effects. Results: The total amount of morphine consumed during the intraoperative and the first 24 postoperative hours was found to be significantly lower in the ESPB group compared to the control group (P < 0.001). Moreover, the time to first analgesic request was significantly longer in patients receiving ESPB as analgesia (P < 0.001). No statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups regarding complications. Conclusion: Bilateral US-ESPB is useful intervention for providing adequate pain management in lumbar spine surgeries.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 13173,Gabapentin,,

The authors discuss their experience using SA in a modern complex lumbar spine surgery practice to describe its utility and implementation. Methods: Data from patients receiving SA for lumbar spine surgery by one surgeon from March 2017 to December 2020 were collected via a retrospective chart review. Cases were divided into nonfusion and fusion procedure categories and analyzed for demographics and baseline medical status; pre-, intra-, and postoperative events; hospital course, including Acute Pain Service (APS) consults; and follow-up visit outcome data. Results: A total of 345 consecutive lumbar spine procedures were found, with 343 records complete for analysis, including 181 fusion and 162 nonfusion procedures and spinal levels from T11 through S1. The fusion group was significantly older (mean age 65.9 ± 12.4 vs 59.5 ± 15.4 years, p < 0.001) and had a significantly higher proportion of patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status Classification class III (p = 0.009) than the nonfusion group. There were no intraoperative conversions to GA, with infrequent need for a second dose of SA preoperatively (2.9%, 10/343) and rare preoperative conversion to GA (0.6%, 2/343) across fusion and nonfusion groups. Rates of complications during hospitalization were comparable to those seen in the literature. The APS was consulted for 2.9% (10/343) of procedures. An algorithm for the integration of SA into a lumbar spine surgery practice, from surgical and anesthetic perspectives, is also offered. Conclusions: SA is a viable, safe, and effective option for lumbar spine surgery across a wide range of age and health statuses, particularly in older patients and those who want to avoid GA. The authors' protocol, based in part on the largest set of data currently available describing complex instrumented fusion surgeries of the lumbar spine completed under SA, presents guidance and best practices to integrate SA into contemporary lumbar spine practices.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 10357,Gabapentin,,

M.",Lidocaine Infusion for the Management of Postoperative Pain and Delirium (LIMPP): protocol for a randomised control trial,"Introduction Postoperative delirium is a frequent adverse event following elective non-cardiac surgery. The occurrence of delirium increases the risk of functional impairment, placement to facilities other than home after discharge, cognitive impairment at discharge, as well as in-hospital and possibly long-term mortality. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of effective strategies to minimise the risk from modifiable risk factors, including postoperative pain control and the analgesic regimen. Use of potent opioids, currently the backbone of postoperative pain control, alters cognition and has been associated with an increased risk of postoperative delirium. Literature supports the intraoperative use of lidocaine infusions to decrease postoperative opioid requirements, however, whether the use of postoperative lidocaine infusions is associated with lower opioid requirements and subsequently a reduction in postoperative delirium has not been investigated. Methods and analysis The Lidocaine Infusion for the Management of Postoperative Pain and Delirium trial is a randomised, double-blinded study of a postoperative 48-hour infusion of lidocaine at 1.33 mg/kg/hour versus placebo in older patients undergoing major reconstructive spinal surgery at the University of California, San Francisco. Our primary outcome is incident delirium measured daily by the Confusion Assessment Method in the first three postoperative days. Secondary outcomes include delirium severity, changes in cognition, pain scores, opioid use, incidence of opioid related side effects and functional benefits including time to discharge and improved recovery from surgery. Lidocaine safety will be assessed with daily screening questionnaires and lidocaine plasma levels. Ethics and dissemination This study protocol has been approved by the ethics board at the University of California, San Francisco. The results of this study will be published in a peer-review journal and presented at national conferences as poster or oral presentations.

Patients with increased age, preoperative cognitive impairment, comorbidities, perioperative polypharmacy, and delayed surgery are more prone to develop POD after hip fracture surgery. In this narrative review, we outlined the latest findings on postoperative delirium in geriatric patients with hip fractures, focusing on its pathophysiology, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. Perioperative risk prediction, avoidance of certain medications, and orthogeriatric comprehensive care are all examples of effective interventions. Choices of anesthesia technique may not be associated with a significant difference in the incidence of postoperative delirium in geriatric patients with hip fractures. There are few pharmaceutical measures available for POD treatment. Dexmedetomidine and multimodal analgesia may be effective for managing postoperative delirium, and adverse complications should be considered when using antipsychotics. In conclusion, perioperative risk intervention based on orthogeriatric comprehensive care is the most effective strategy for preventing postoperative delirium in geriatric patients with hip fractures.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16719,Gabapentin,,

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of polypharmacy, and to investigate its association with postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in older adult patients who underwent elective major surgery at Siriraj Hospital—Thailand's largest national tertiary referral center. Methods: This prospective study included older adult patients aged ≥65 years who were scheduled for elective major surgery during December, 2017 to December, 2019 study period. Patient demographic, sociodemographic, anthropometric, clinical, comorbidity, anesthetic, surgical, and medication data were collected and compared between the polypharmacy and non-polypharmacy groups. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) was diagnosed in patients with at least a 2-point decrease in their Montreal Cognitive Assessment score after surgery. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of POCD. Results: A total of 250 patients (141 males, 109 females) with an average age of 72.88 ± 6.93 years were included. The prevalence of polypharmacy was 74%. Preoperative data showed the polypharmacy group to be more likely to be receiving potentially inappropriate medications, to be scheduled for cardiovascular thoracic surgery, and to have more comorbidities. There was a non-significant trend in the association of polypharmacy and POCD (crude odds ratio (OR): 2.11, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.90–4.94; p = 0.08). Benzodiazepine, desflurane, or isoflurane administration during surgery were all significantly associated with POCD in univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis revealed intraoperative benzodiazepine (adjusted OR [aOR]: 2.24, 95% CI: 1.10–4.68; p = 0.026) and isoflurane (aOR: 2.80, 95% CI: 1.35–5.81; p = 0.006) as two independent variables associated with the development of POCD. Desflurane was found to be a protective factor for POCD with a crude OR of 0.17 (95% CI: 0.03–0.74, p = 0.019); however, independent association was not found in multivariate analysis. Conclusion: There was a high prevalence of polypharmacy in this study; however, although close (p = 0.08), significant association was not found between polypharmacy and POCD. Benzodiazepine and isoflurane were both identified as independent predictors of the development of POCD among older adult patients undergoing elective major surgery, especially among those classified as polypharmacy.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 10178,Gabapentin,,

However, the safety of perioperative gabapentin use among older patients remains uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To examine in-hospital adverse clinical events associated with perioperative gabapentin use among older patients undergoing major surgery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study using data from the Premier Healthcare Database included patients aged 65 years or older who underwent major surgery at US hospitals within 7 days of hospital admission from January 1, 2009, to March 31, 2018, and did not use gabapentin before surgery. Data were analyzed from June 14, 2021, to May 23, 2022. EXPOSURES: Gabapentin use within 2 days after surgery. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was delirium, identified using diagnosis codes, and secondary outcomes were new antipsychotic use, pneumonia, and in-hospital death between postoperative day 3 and hospital discharge. To reduce confounding, 1:1 propensity score matching was performed. Risk ratios (RRs) and risk differences (RDs) with 95% CIs were estimated. RESULTS: Among 967 547 patients before propensity score matching (mean [SD] age, 76.2 [7.4] years; 59.6% female), the rate of perioperative gabapentin use was 12.3% (119 087 patients). After propensity score matching, 237 872 (118 936 pairs) gabapentin users and nonusers (mean [SD] age, 74.5 [6.7] years; 62.7% female) were identified.

Furthermore, elderly adults are more susceptible to postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction, which may be exacerbated by both poorly controlled postoperative pain and commonly used pain medications. This narrative review summarizes the literature published in the past 10 years for several nonopioid analgesics commonly prescribed to the geriatric patient in the perioperative period. Nonopioid analgesics are broken down as follows: medications prescribed throughout the perioperative period (acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), medications limited to the acute perioperative setting ( N -methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, dexmedetomidine, dexamethasone, and local anesthetics), and medications to be used with caution in the geriatric patient population (gabapentinoids and muscle relaxants). Our search identified 1757 citations, but only 33 specifically focused on geriatric analgesia. Of these, only 21 were randomized clinical trials' and 1 was a systematic review. While guidance in tailoring pain regimens that focus on the use of nonopioid medications in the geriatric patient is lacking, we summarize the current literature and highlight that some nonopioid medications may extend benefits to the geriatric patient beyond analgesia.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 10143,Gabapentin,,

Inadequate postoperative analgesia usually leads to severe postsurgical pain, which could cause patients to suffer from many other related complications. Meanwhile, there is no appropriate analgesic strategy for patients with spinal neoplasms. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a protocol for a randomized double-blind controlled trial to evaluate the effect of esketamine combined with pregabalin on postsurgical pain in spinal surgery. Patients aged 18 to 65 years scheduled for spinal neoplasm resection will be randomly allocated into the combined and control groups in a 1:1 ratio. In the combined group, esketamine will be given during the during the surgery procedure until 48-h postoperative period, and pregabalin will be taken from 2 h before the surgery to 2 weeks postoperatively. The control group will receive normal saline and placebo capsules at the same time points. Both groups received a background analgesic regimen by using patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (containing 100 μg sufentanil and 16 mg ondansetron) until 2 days after surgery. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of this trial, all the researchers and patients will be blinded until the completion of this study. The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients with acute moderate-to-severe postsurgical pain (visual analog scale, VAS ≥ 40, range: 0-100, with 0, no pain; 100, the worst pain) during the 48-h postoperative period. The secondary outcomes will include the maximal VAS scores (when the patients felt the most intense pain over the last 24 h before being interviewed) at 0-2 h, 2-24 h, 24-48 h, and 48-72 h after leaving the operating room and 24 h before discharge; the incidence of acute moderate-to-severe postsurgical pain at each other time point; chronic postsurgical pain assessment; neuropathic pain assessment; and the incidence of drug-related adverse events and other postoperative complications, such as postoperative delirium and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). DISCUSSION: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of esketamine combined with pregabalin on acute postsurgical pain in patients undergoing resection of spinal neoplasms. The safety of this perioperative pain management strategy will also be examined. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05096468.

Afterward, the rate of appropriateness of the treatments and the agreement between the rehabilitations actually provided and the AUC recommendation were measured. RESULTS: Over the study period, a consecutive series of 101 patients were included. The mean age was 75 years. Most of the patients were males (51.5%). Seventeen scenarios were observed in our patients. The most common scenario were patients with low functional/physical demands (48%), intact cognitive function (91%), non-arthroplasty approach (76%), and no post-operative delirium(97%). The overall appropriateness rate of the provided rehabilitation treatments for our patients in comparison with AUC recommendation was appropriate in 356 (48.7%) (P = .001), maybe appropriate in 19 (3%) (P < .001), rarely appropriate in 61 (8.3%) (P = .59), and 40% of rehabilitation procedures were not provided (P < .001). The actual treatment was appropriate and in agreement with the AUC recommendations in (100%) of three procedures (Deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis, pain management, and Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility or Skilled Nursing Facility), in (72.2%) of osteoporosis assessment/management, in (63.8%) of outpatient occupational/physical therapy, in (10.2%) of delirium prevention, in (33.3%) of delirium management and in (25%) of home care therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that there is a remarkable variation in the appropriateness of the various post-operative rehabilitation procedures for elderly hip fracture. Additionally, the AUC application was easy to use and simple for identifying post-operative rehabilitation protocols for elderly hip fractures, hence, we recommend to use it in the trauma clinical practice.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the mFI-5 in predicting complications in geriatric patients with an ankle fracture. METHODS: A retrospective examination was made of a total of 94 patients aged >65 years who were treated for an ankle fracture in our hospital between 2015 and 2020. Weber type A, B, and C fractures were included in the study. For each patient, the mFI-5 was calculated for the comorbidity status of diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension requiring drugs, and non-independent functional status. Multivariance logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the mFI-5 points as a predictor of negative outcomes. RESULTS: The mFI-5 was observed to be effective in the prediction of the complications of hospital re-admission, wound site infec-tion, life-threatening medical complications, and the presence of any complication (p<0.05). In the prediction of whether or not there was any complication, the mFI-5 was determined to be a more effective tool than body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiol-ogist, age, length of stay in hospital, and duration of operation (p<0.05, OR=2.726, 95% Confidence Interval=1.285-5.783). CONCLUSION: The mFI-5 is a sensitive tool for the prediction of complications which may develop following geriatric ankle frac-ture. The five comorbidities which constitute the mFI-5 are easily obtained from the patient anamnesis, and this renders it a practical clinical tool to identify high-risk patients, determine the preoperative risks, and improve the health-care service.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16940,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Studies published so far have shown that anesthetic drugs and intervention may have different impacts on patient’s outcome. Among these drugs, propofol and, more recently, local anesthetics have been mostly targeted. Methods/design: This study will be a prospective randomized control trial aiming to include 400 patients scheduled for curative colorectal surgery. Patients will be randomized to have general anesthesia with propofol or with sevoflurane. Each study group will be further divided into 2 subgroups of patients, of which one will receive intravenous lidocaine perioperatively. The primary outcome is to compare the incidence of cancer recurrence and survival after propofol versus sevoflurane anesthesia added or not intravenous lidocaine. Secondary outcomes will include the severity of postoperative pain, resumption of bowel function, morphine consumption, length of hospital stay, postoperative chronic pain, and rate of postoperative complications. Discussion: To our knowledge, this is the first randomized control trial registered on ClinicalTrials.gov designed to compare the effects of two different anesthetic techniques added perioperative intravenous lidocaine infusion on long-term outcomes exclusively in colorectal cancer patients undergoing surgery. The study will bring more accurate data on the effect of propofol-TIVA and perioperative iv lidocaine on the incidence of recurrences after intended curative colorectal surgery.

We sought to implement a preoperative cognitive impairment and frailty screening programme to meet the unique needs of our rural academic centre. METHODS: Through stakeholder interviews, we identified five primary drivers underlying screening implementation: staff education, technology infrastructure, workload impact, screening value and patient-provider communication. Based on these findings, we implemented cognitive dysfunction (AD8, Mini-Cog) and frailty (Clinical Frailty Scale) screening in our preoperative care clinic and select surgical clinics. RESULTS: In the preoperative care clinic, many of our patients scored positive for clinical frailty (428 of 1231, 35%) and for cognitive impairment (264 of 1781, 14.8%). In our surgical clinics, 27% (35 of 131) and 9% (12 of 131) scored positive for clinical frailty and cognitive impairment, respectively. Compliance to screening improved from 48% to 86% 1 year later. CONCLUSION: We qualitatively analysed stakeholder feedback to drive the successful implementation of a preoperative cognitive impairment and frailty screening programme in our rural tertiary care centre. Preliminary data suggest that a clinically significant proportion of older adults screen positive for preoperative cognitive impairment and frailty and would benefit from tailored inpatient care.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16325,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Frailty is a risk factor for adverse surgical outcomes, but its relationship with chronic pain after cardiac surgery is unknown. This study aimed to address the association between frailty and chronic pain following cardiac surgery. METHODS: This sub-study of the Anesthesia Geriatric Evaluation study included 518 patients ≥ 70 years undergoing elective cardiac surgery. Pain was evaluated with the Short-Form 36 questionnaire prior to and one year after surgery. Associations between chronic postoperative pain and frailty domains, including medication use, nutritional status, mobility, physical functioning, cognition, HRQL, living situation and educational level, were investigated with multivariable regression analysis. RESULTS: Chronic pain one year after cardiac surgery was reported in 182 patients (35%). Medication use, living situation, mobility, gait speed, Nagi's physical functioning and preoperative HRQL were frailty domains associated with chronic pain after surgery. For patients with chronic pain physical HRQL after one year was worse compared to patients without chronic pain (β -10.37, 99% CI -12.57 - -8.17). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative polypharmacy, living alone, physical frailty and lower mental HRQL are associated with chronic pain following cardiac surgery. Chronic postoperative pain is related to worse physical HRQL one year after cardiac surgery. These findings may guide future preoperative interventions to reduce chronic pain and poor HRQL after cardiac surgery in older patients.

Although screening for geriatric impairments may improve risk prediction in this group, it has not been studied previously. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated patients ≥70 years with elective surgery for non-metastatic rectal cancer between 2014 and 2018 in nine Dutch hospitals. The predictive value of six geriatric parameters in combination with standard preoperative predictors was studied for postoperative complications, delirium, and length of stay (LOS) using logistic regression analyses. The geriatric parameters included the four VMS-questionnaire items pertaining to functional impairment, fall risk, delirium risk, and malnutrition, as well as mobility problems and polypharmacy. Standard predictors included age, sex, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)-classification, comorbidities, tumor stage, and neoadjuvant therapy. Changes in model performance were evaluated by comparing Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the regression models with and without geriatric parameters. RESULTS: We included 575 patients (median age 75 years; 32% female). None of the geriatric parameters improved risk prediction for complications or LOS. The addition of delirium risk to the standard preoperative prediction model improved model performance for predicting postoperative delirium (AUC 0.75 vs 0.65, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Geriatric parameters did not improve risk prediction for postoperative complications or LOS in older patients with rectal cancer. Delirium risk screening using the VMS-questionnaire improved risk prediction for delirium. Older patients undergoing rectal cancer surgery are a pre-selected group with few impairments. Geriatric screening may have additional value earlier in the care pathway before treatment decisions are made.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 10664,Search update 2023-11-13,,

The present study examines the effect of preoperative nutritional status and frailty on this significant adverse event. METHODS: The data of 455 patients who underwent on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were analyzed retrospectively. Demographic data were recorded, and intraoperative and postoperative parameters, frailty score, geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI), and prognostic nutritional index (PNI) were calculated. Risk factors for AKI within 7 postoperative days were investigated in accordance with the kidney disease improving global outcomes classification. RESULTS: Preoperative urea and creatinine values were significantly higher (p = .006 vs. p = .006), while hemoglobin, hematocrit, and estimated glomerular filtration rate values were significantly lower (p = .011, p = .008 vs. p = .006) in the AKI group than no AKI group. In the intraoperative period, the cardiopulmonary bypass time was longer in the AKI group (p = .031), and the need for dopamine, steradine, and red blood cells transfusion was greater (p = .026, p = .038 vs. p = .015) than no AKI group. The number of patients with a frailty score of 1-3 was significantly higher in the AKI group (p = .042). Similarly, the GNRI and PNI values, indicating nutritional status, were higher in the AKI group (p = .047 vs. p = .024). The independent risk factors for AKI were a GNRI of <91, the intraoperative need for dobutamine, preoperative serum creatinine of >1.3, and hemoglobin of <10 (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Malnutrition and frailty are strongly associated with AKI after CABG.

Joint-preserving treatment options for IASRCTs in young and high-demand elderly patients are limited. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and radiologic outcomes of combined anterior latissimus dorsi and teres major (aLDTM) tendon transfer in patients with IASRCTs without reconstruction of the superior rotator cuff and capsular portion. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted between 2015 and 2018. We included patients who underwent combined aLDTM tendon transfer for IASRCTs. Clinical outcomes included visual analog scale for pain, Constant score, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, University of California Los Angeles shoulder scores, activities of daily living requiring active internal rotation score, active range of motion, subscapularis-specific physical examination, and rate of return to work. Radiographic analyses included the assessment of acromiohumeral distance, Hamada grade for cuff tear arthropathy, rate of anterior glenohumeral subluxation reduction, and transferred tendon integrity at 2 years postoperatively. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 38.1 ± 13.7 (range: 24-63) months. Of the patients, 30 (mean age: 64.1 years) met the study criteria. Postoperatively, mean Constant, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, University of California Los Angeles, and activities of daily living requiring active internal rotation scores improved from 47.4 to 69.9 (P < .001), 44.9 to 79.2 (P < .001), 20.0 to 28.7 (P < .001), and 13.2 to 26.9 (P < .001), respectively. The mean active range of motion was significantly increased postoperatively for both forward elevation (P < .001) and internal rotation at the back (P < .001). Of the patients, 24 (83%) returned to their previous work. No significant progression of cuff tear arthropathy was observed at final follow-up (Hamada grade: preoperative 1.3 ± 0.5 to postoperative 1.5 ± 0.7; p=0.155).

Furthermore, the impact of frailty can be confounded by comorbidities or metastatic disease burden. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of frailty and comorbidities on adverse outcomes in the surgical management of metastatic spine disease. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Retrospective analysis of a nationwide database to include patients undergoing spinal fusion for metastatic spine disease. PATIENT SAMPLE: A total of 1,974 frail patients who received spinal fusion with spinal metastasis, and 1,975 propensity score matched non-frail patients. OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes analyzed included mortality, complications, length of stay (LOS), nonroutine discharges and costs. METHODS: A validated binary frailty index (Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups) was used to identify frail and non-frail groups, and propensity score-matched analysis (including demographics, comorbidities, surgical and tumor characteristics) was performed. Sub-group analysis of levels involved was performed for cervical, thoracic, lumbar and junctional spine. Multivariable-regression techniques were used to develop predictive models for outcomes using frailty and the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI). RESULTS: 7,772 patients underwent spinal fusion with spinal metastasis, of which 1,974 (25.4%) patients were identified as frail. Following propensity score matching for frail (n=1,974) and not-frail (n=1,975) groups, frailty demonstrated significantly greater medical complications (OR=1.58; 95% CI 1.33–1.86), surgical complications (OR=1.46; 95% CI 1.15–1.85), LOS (OR=2.65; 95% CI 2.09–3.37), nonroutine discharges (OR=1.79; 95% CI 1.46–2.20) and costs (OR=1.68; 95% CI 1.32–2.14). Differences in mortality were only observed in subgroup analysis and were greater in frail junctional and lumbar spine subgroups. Models using ECI alone (AUC=0.636-0.788) demonstrated greater predictive ability compared to those using frailty alone (AUC=0.633–0.752). However, frailty combined with ECI improved the prediction of increased LOS (AUC=0.811), cost (AUC=0.768), medical complications (AUC=0.723) and nonroutine discharges (AUC=0.718). Predictive modeling of frailty in subgroups demonstrated the greatest performance for mortality (AUC=0.750) in the lumbar spine, otherwise performed similarly for LOS, costs, complications, and discharge across subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of frailty existed in the current patient cohort. Frailty contributed to worse short-term adverse outcomes and could be more influential in the lumbar and junctional spine due to higher risk of deconditioning in the postoperative period. Predictions for short term outcomes can be improved by adding frailty to comorbidity indices, suggesting a more comprehensive preoperative risk stratification should include frailty. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16331,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Nevertheless, most patients requiring prolonged hospital stay are frail older subjects; thus, we hypothesized a significant influence of pre-operative physical performance, as a frailty measure, on in-hospital stay after elective cardiac surgery. METHODS: In a prospective, single-center, cohort study we enrolled patients aged 75+ years referred to our Division of Cardiac Surgery at Careggi University Hospital, for their first elective cardiac surgery. All participants were preoperatively evaluated by a team composed by a cardiac surgeon, a cardiologist, an anaesthesist, and a geriatrician to assess global cardiac surgery risk; lower extremity performance was measured with the Short Physical Performance Battery-SPPB. RESULTS: A total of 518 patients were included in the study. Mean age was 79.5 ± 3.3 years; 256 (49.4%) were women. Isolated coronary by pass graft was performed in 37 patients (7.1%), isolated valve surgery in 115 (22.0%), and combined cardiac surgery procedures in 366 (70,9%). In a multivariable model, SPPB score was strongly associated with hospital length of stay both as continuous, categorized and dichotomous variable (p < 0.001; p = 0.002; p = 0.002 respectively) in all study population, and in subgroup of patients candidate to cardiac surgery considered by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons calculator score (p = 0.023; p = 0.056; p = 0.013 respectively).

Sarcopenia refers to an age- or pathology-associated muscle loss and has been demonstrated to correlate with poorer outcomes in several surgical conditions. This study assessed the impact of sarcopenia on morbidity and mortality in elderly patients undergoing EL. METHODS: Patients aged ≥ 65 years-old undergoing EL between May 2012-June 2017 with a pre-operative abdominal computerised tomography (CT) scan at Middlemore Hospital (New Zealand) were included. Psoas and Skeletal Muscle Index (PMI and SMI) were calculated from abdominal CT measurements after standardisation based on height. Validated cut-offs for sarcopenia were used. Frailty was estimated using the 11-point modified frailty index (mFI). The primary outcome was 30-day, 1-year, and 4-year post-operative mortality. Secondary outcomes included correlations between mFI and sarcopenic measures, unplanned readmissions, and post-operative complications. RESULTS: A total of 167 patients (84 sarcopenic; 83 non-sarcopenic) were included. Sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic patients had similar 30-day (14.2 vs. 12.0%; p = 0.84), 1-year (23.8 vs. 25.3%; p = 0.96), and 4-year (39.3 vs. 47.0%; p = 0.40) mortality rates following an EL. Survivors had a higher mean PMI at 1-year (p = 0.0078) and 4-year (p = 0.013) but not 30-day (p = 0.40) follow-up. Sarcopenia performed poorly in discriminating between 30-day (AUC 0.51) and 1-year (AUC 0.53) mortality. The mFI did not correlate with PMI (p = 0.85) nor SMI (p = 0.18). Rates of readmissions and post-operative complications did not differ between sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic cohorts.

All participants who completed the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Brain Health Assessment preoperatively and postoperatively were assessed with the confusion assessment method for intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) and/or the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (NuDESC). Patients had frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings (SedLine Root, Masimo, Corp) quantitatively analyzed. We used 60 seconds of artifact-free EEG (without burst suppression) extracted from the middle of the maintenance period to calculate the normalized power spectral density (PSD). Comparisons were made between those who did or did not receive ketamine and according to results from neurocognitive assessments. RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients (of a total of 155, enrolled and consented) had EEG of sufficient quality for analysis (42 women). Overall, we found a significant increase in the EEG power in the moderate frequency range (10-20 Hz) in patients that received ketamine. When the patients were divided by their preoperative cognitive status, this result in the ketamine group only held true for the cognitively normal patients. Patients that were cognitively impaired at baseline did not demonstrate a significant change in EEG characteristics based on ketamine administration, but impaired patients that received ketamine had a significantly higher rate of postoperative delirium (52% ketamine versus 20% no ketamine) (odds ratio [OR], 4.36; confidence interval [CI], 1.02-18.22; P = .048). In patients determined to be preoperatively cognitively normal, the incidence of postoperative delirium was not significantly associated with ketamine administration (19% ketamine versus 17% no ketamine) (OR, 1.10; CI, 0.30-4.04; P = .5833). CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine-related changes in EEG are observed in a heterogeneous group of patients receiving spine surgery. This result was driven primarily by the effect of ketamine on cognitively normal patients and not observed in patients that were cognitively impaired at baseline. Furthermore, patients who were cognitively impaired at baseline and who had received ketamine were more likely to develop postoperative delirium, suggesting that cognitive vulnerability might be predicted by the lack of a neurophysiologic response to ketamine.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16800,Search update 2023-11-13,,

G.",Cognitive Recovery by Decade in Healthy 40- to 80-Year-Old Volunteers After Anesthesia Without Surgery,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction are the most common complications for older surgical patients. General anesthesia may contribute to the development of these conditions, but there are little data on the association of age with cognitive recovery from anesthesia in the absence of surgery or underlying medical condition. METHODS: We performed a single-center cohort study of healthy adult volunteers 40 to 80 years old (N = 71, mean age 58.5 years, and 44% women) with no underlying cognitive dysfunction. Volunteers underwent cognitive testing before and at multiple time points after 2 hours of general anesthesia consisting of propofol induction and sevoflurane maintenance, akin to a general anesthetic for a surgical procedure, although no procedure was performed. The primary outcome was time to recovery to cognitive baseline on the Postoperative Quality of Recovery Scale (PQRS) within 30 days of anesthesia. Secondary cognitive outcomes were time to recovery on in-depth neuropsychological batteries, including the National Institutes of Health Toolbox and well-validated paper-and-pencil tests. The primary hypothesis is that time to recovery of cognitive function after general anesthesia increases across decades from 40 to 80 years of age. We examined this with discrete-time logit regression (for the primary outcome) and linear mixed models for interactions of age decade with time postanesthesia (for secondary outcomes). RESULTS: There was no association between age group and recovery to baseline on the PQRS; 36 of 69 (52%) recovered within 60-minute postanesthesia and 63 of 69 (91%) by day 1. Hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for each decade compared to 40- to 49-year olds were: 50 to 59 years, 1.41 (0.50-4.03); 60 to 69 years, 1.03 (0.35-3.00); and 70 to 80 years, 0.69 (0.25-1.88). There were no significant differences between older decades relative to the 40- to 49-year reference decade in recovery to baseline on secondary cognitive measures. CONCLUSIONS: Recovery of cognitive function to baseline was rapid and did not differ between age decades of participants, although the number in each decade was small. These results suggest that anesthesia alone may not be associated with cognitive recovery in healthy adults of any age decade.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 6724,Search update 2023-11-13,,

It remains, however, to be demonstrated whether prehabilitation in these patients reduces postoperative complications.Methods:This 2-center, prospective, single-blinded randomized clinical trial was carried out in 2 large teaching hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients (≥60 years) with colorectal (pre)malignancy scheduled for elective colorectal resection and with a score ≤7 metabolic equivalents on the veterans-specific activity questionnaire were randomly assigned to the prehabilitation group or the usual care group by using block-stratified randomization. An oxygen uptake at the ventilatory anaerobic threshold <11 mL/kg/min at the baseline cardiopulmonary exercise test was the final inclusion criterion. Inclusion was based on a power analysis. Patients in the prehabilitation group participated in a personalized 3-week (3 sessions per week, nine sessions in total) supervised exercise program given in community physical therapy practices before colorectal resection. Patients in the reference group received usual care. The primary outcome was the number of patients with one or more complications within 30 days of surgery, graded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis.Results:Between February 2014 and December 2018, 57 patients [30 males and 27 females; mean age 73.6 years (standard deviation 6.1), range 61-88 years] were randomized to either prehabilitation (n = 28) or usual care (n = 29). The rate of postoperative complications was lower in the prehabilitation group (n = 12, 42.9%) than in the usual care group (n = 21, 72.4%, relative risk 0.59, 95% confidence interval 0.37-0.96, P = 0.024).Conclusions:Exercise prehabilitation reduced postoperative complications in high-risk patients scheduled to undergo elective colon resection for (pre)malignancy. Prehabilitation should be considered as usual care in high-risk patients scheduled for elective colon, and probably also rectal, surgery.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 9580,Search update 2023-11-13,,

This study aimed to investigate whether preoperative gait function, quantified and summarized using the Cardiff Classifier, can predict improvements in postoperative patient-reported activities of daily living, and overall gait function 1 year after total hip arthroplasty (THA). Secondly, to explore relationships between pre-to-post surgical change in gait function versus changes in patient-reported and performance-based function. Thirty-two patients scheduled for THA and 25 nonpathological individuals were included in this prospective cohort study. Patients were evaluated before THA and 1 year postoperatively using 3D gait analysis, patient-reported outcomes, and performance-based tests. Kinematic and kinetic gait parameters, derived from 3D gait analysis, were quantified using the Cardiff Classifier. Linear regressions investigated the predictive value of preoperative gait function on postoperative outcomes of function, and univariate correlations explored relationships between pre-to-post surgical changes in outcome measures. Preoperative gait function, by means of Cardiff Classifier, explained 35% and 30% of the total variance in change in patient-reported activities of daily living, and in gait function, respectively. Moderate-to-strong correlations were found between change in gait function and change in patient-reported function and pain, while no correlations were found between change in gait function and performance-based function. Clinical significance: Preoperative gait function predicts postsurgical function to a moderate degree, while improvements in gait function after surgery are more closely related to how patients perceive function than their maximal performance of functional tests.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16336,Search update 2023-11-13,,

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA) application on short and long-term spatiotemporal gait parameters, maximum plantar pressure (MPP), and functional status in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Research question: What is the change process in spatiotemporal parameters without any intervention before and after TKA surgery? Methods: This study is a prospective and cross-sectional study. Participants were assessed preoperatively at the 1st week (Pre1W), postoperative 1st month (Post1M) and 6th month (Post6M). Spatiotemporal parameters and MMP were assessed using the Win Track platform (Medicapteurs Technology, France) and functional states were assessed using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) and the Lequesne Index. Results: Significant improvements were found in the WOMAC and Lequesne Index values in the Post1M and Post6M periods compared to the preoperative period. However, the improvement in WOMAC and Lequesne Index scores in the Post6M period was significant compared to the scores in the Post1M period (p < 0.01). Spatiotemporal parameters deteriorated in the Post1M period, while improvements were observed in the Post6M period. We observed that patients had worse gait parameters in the near postoperative period than before surgery. It was the period with the greatest improvements in long-term outcomes. Significance: In the light of our study results, we think that early gait disturbances in patients who underwent direct TKA may be caused by physiological processes. Therefore, we believe that there is no need for any intervention for gait disorders that occur in the early postoperative period.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16337,Search update 2023-11-13,,

C., Lee, S., Butte, A. J., Leung, J. M., Donovan, A. L.",Postoperative delirium prediction using machine learning models and preoperative electronic health record data,"BACKGROUND: Accurate, pragmatic risk stratification for postoperative delirium (POD) is necessary to target preventative resources toward high-risk patients. Machine learning (ML) offers a novel approach to leveraging electronic health record (EHR) data for POD prediction. We sought to develop and internally validate a ML-derived POD risk prediction model using preoperative risk features, and to compare its performance to models developed with traditional logistic regression. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of preoperative EHR data from 24,885 adults undergoing a procedure requiring anesthesia care, recovering in the main post-anesthesia care unit, and staying in the hospital at least overnight between December 2016 and December 2019 at either of two hospitals in a tertiary care health system. One hundred fifteen preoperative risk features including demographics, comorbidities, nursing assessments, surgery type, and other preoperative EHR data were used to predict postoperative delirium (POD), defined as any instance of Nursing Delirium Screening Scale ≥2 or positive Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit within the first 7 postoperative days. Two ML models (Neural Network and XGBoost), two traditional logistic regression models (""clinician-guided"" and ""ML hybrid""), and a previously described delirium risk stratification tool (AWOL-S) were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and positive predictive value. Model calibration was assessed with a calibration curve. Patients with no POD assessments charted or at least 20% of input variables missing were excluded. RESULTS: POD incidence was 5.3%. The AUC-ROC for Neural Net was 0.841 [95% CI 0. 816-0.863] and for XGBoost was 0.851 [95% CI 0.827-0.874], which was significantly better than the clinician-guided (AUC-ROC 0.763 [0.734-0.793], p < 0.001) and ML hybrid (AUC-ROC 0.824 [0.800-0.849], p < 0.001) regression models and AWOL-S (AUC-ROC 0.762 [95% CI 0.713-0.812], p < 0.001). Neural Net, XGBoost, and ML hybrid models demonstrated excellent calibration, while calibration of the clinician-guided and AWOL-S models was moderate; they tended to overestimate delirium risk in those already at highest risk. CONCLUSION: Using pragmatically collected EHR data, two ML models predicted POD in a broad perioperative population with high discrimination. Optimal application of the models would provide automated, real-time delirium risk stratification to improve perioperative management of surgical patients at risk for POD.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 7299,Search update 2023-11-13,,

The main objective of our study was to analyze the association between geriatrics factors and the hospital LOS for older patients undergoing TAVR for severe aortic stenosis. METHODS: This retrospective single-center study included all patients aged ≥75 who underwent TAVR between January 2018 and January 2019. Hospital LOS and postoperative complications were analyzed regarding the geriatric factors recorded during a systematic preoperative, comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA). The individualized-care plans established after the preoperative CGA were also analyzed. RESULTS: median LOS of the 196 patients included was 6 days (interquartile range: 4-8), and 29% of patients had prolonged LOS. In a multivariable analysis, the preoperative factors associated with a prolonged hospital LOS were EuroSCORE I (p value = 0.02), prior major neurocognitive disorders (p value = 0.01), femoral access (p value <0.001), all complications (p value <0.001), and discharge in a rehabilitation center (p value <0.001). One-fourth (27%) of the patients had at least 1 geriatric complication. After CGA, 69 patients did not need any geriatric recommendation, whereas for the 127 other patients, an individualized-care plan was established but only 46 (36%) of them were followed up. CONCLUSION: Our results favor the preoperative screening for major neurocognitive disorders in order to reduce LOS. Furthermore, the proposed individual-care plans after CGA were poorly followed.

K., Heinrich, M.",Association of cholinesterase activities and POD in older adult abdominal surgical patients,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a frequent complication after surgery. Older adult patients undergoing abdominal surgery are at higher risk for developing POD. Studies on the association of cholinesterase activities and POD are rare, but leading hypotheses implicate that the cholinergic pathway might play an important role in neuroinflammation and development of POD. The objective of this study was to figure out if there is an association between the development of POD and acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase (AChE and BuChE) activities in older adult patients undergoing abdominal surgery. METHODS: The investigation was performed with a subpopulation of BioCog study patients. The BioCog project ( http://www.biocog.eu ) is a prospective multicenter observational study in older adult surgical patients. Patients ≥ 65 years undergoing elective surgery of at least 60 minutes who scored more than 23 points in the Mini-Mental-State-Examination were included. POD was assessed twice a day on seven consecutive days after the surgery, using the test instruments Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (Nu-Desc) and Confusion Assessment Method (CAM and CAM-ICU) and a patient chart review. Pre- and postoperative blood cholinesterase activities were measured with a photometric rapid-point-of-care-testing. The association between cholinesterase activities and POD was analyzed in a subpopulation of abdominal surgical patients using multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-seven patients were included for analysis (mean age 73 years, 59% female). Fifty-two patients (41%) fulfilled the criteria of POD. These patients were significantly older, had a longer time of surgery and anesthesia and achieved higher comorbidity scores compared to patients without POD. After adjusting for age, duration of surgery and charlson comorbity index, we found an association between pre- and postoperative AChE activity (U/gHb) and the development of POD (Odds ratio (OR), [95% confidence interval (CI)], preoperative 0.95 [0.89-1.00], postoperative 0.94 [0.89-1.00]). CONCLUSIONS: We found an association between POD and AChE activity and provided new information considering patients with abdominal surgery. Future analyses should examine course dynamics of postoperative cholinesterase activities in order to clarify interactions between the cholinergic system and pathophysiological mechanisms leading to POD.

Cognitive monitoring may be improved by a novel digital clock drawing test (dCDT). We screened for cognitive impairment with the 4 A Test (4AT) and then administered the dCDT pre and post short-stay procedure (endoscopy). The primary aim was to investigate whether the dCDT was sensitive to a change in cognitive status postendoscopy. We also investigated if preoperative cognitive status impacted postendoscopy dCDT variables. METHODS: We recruited 100 patients ≥65 years presenting for endoscopy day procedures at a single metropolitan hospital. Participants were assessed after admission and immediately before discharge from the hospital. We administered the 4AT, followed by both command and copy clock conditions of the dCDT. We analysed the total drawing time (dCDT time), as well as scored the drawn clock against the established Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) criteria both before and after endoscopy. RESULTS: Linear regression showed higher 4AT test scores (poorer performance) were associated with longer postoperative dCDT time (β = 5.6, p = 0.012) for the command condition after adjusting for preoperative baseline dCDT metrics, sex, age, and years of education. CONCLUSION: Postoperative dCDT time-based variables slowed in those with baseline cognitive impairment detected by the 4AT, but not for those without cognitive impairment. Our results suggest the dCDT, using the command mode, may help detect cognitive impairment in patients aged >65 years after elective endoscopy.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 7706,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Cognitively impaired and frail surgical patients often experience poor outcomes after surgery, but the impacts of PIMs on these patients are unclear. Our objective was to assess whether perioperative PIM administration was associated with poor outcomes in geriatric surgical patients. We then evaluated the association between PIM administration and postoperative outcomes in subgroups of patients who were frail or cognitively impaired. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients ≥65 years of age who underwent elective inpatient surgery at a large academic medical center from February 2018 to January 2020. Edmonton Frail Scale and Mini-Cog screening tools were administered to all patients at their preoperative clinic visit. A Mini-Cog score of 0 to 2 was considered cognitive impairment, and frailty was defined by an Edmonton Frail Scale score of ≥8. Patients were divided into 2 groups depending on whether they received at least 1 PIM (PIM+), based on the 2019 AGS Beers Criteria, in the perioperative period or none (PIM-). We assessed the association of preoperative frailty, cognitive impairment, and perioperative PIM administration with the length of hospital stay and discharge disposition using multiple regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, ASA physical status, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. RESULTS: Of the 1627 included patients (mean age, 73.7 years), 69.3% (n = 1128) received at least 1 PIM. A total of 12.7% of patients were frail, and 11.1% of patients were cognitively impaired; 64% of the frail patients and 58% of the cognitively impaired patients received at least 1 PIM. Perioperative PIM administration was associated with longer hospital stay after surgery (PIM-, 3.56 ± 5.2 vs PIM+, 4.93 ± 5.66 days; P < .001; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.360-0.546). Frail patients who received PIMs had an average length of stay (LOS) that was nearly 2 days longer than frail patients who did not receive PIMs (PIM-, 4.48 ± 5.04 vs PIM+, 6.33 ± 5.89 days; P = .02). Multiple regression analysis revealed no significant association between PIM administration and proportion of patients discharged to a care facility (PIM+, 26.3% vs PIM-, 28.7%; P = .87; 95% CI, -0.046 to 0.054). CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative PIM administration was common in older surgical patients, including cognitively impaired and frail patients.

Yet, the evidence supporting such an association in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is still sparse. Herein we provide an updated comprehensive overview of the impact of frailty on perioperative and oncologic outcomes in patients undergoing surgery or ablation for RCC. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic review of the English-language literature was conducted using the MEDLINE (via PubMed), Web of Science and the Cochrane Library databases according to the principles highlighted by the EAU Guidelines Office and the PRISMA statement recommendations. The review protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021242516). The overall quality of evidence was assessed according to GRADE recommendations. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Overall, 18 studies were included in the qualitative analysis. Most of these were retrospective single-center series including patients undergoing surgery for non-metastatic RCC. The overall quality of evidence was low. A variety of measures were used for frailty assessment, including the Canadian Study of Health and Aging Frailty Index, the five-item frailty index, the Modified Rockwood's Clinical Frailty Scale Score, the Hopkins Frailty score, the Groningen Frailty Index, and the Geriatric nutritional risk index. Sarcopenia was defined based on the Lumbar skeletal muscle mass at cross-sectional imaging, the skeletal muscle index, the total psoas area, or the Psoas Muscle Index. Overall, available studies point to frailty and sarcopenia as potential independent risk factors for worse perioperative and oncological outcomes after surgery or ablation for different RCC stages. Increased patient's frailty was indeed associated with higher risk of perioperative complications, healthcare resources utilization, readmission rates and longer hospitalization periods, as well as potentially lower cancer specific or overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty has been consistently associated with worse outcomes after surgery for RCC, reinforcing the value of preoperative frailty assessment in carefully selected patients. Given the low quality of the available evidence (especially in the setting of tumor ablation), prospective studies are needed to standardize frailty assessments and to identify patients who are expected to benefit most from preoperative geriatric evaluation, aiming to optimize decision-making and postoperative outcomes in patients with RCC.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16848,Search update 2023-11-13,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 75 advanced-stage consecutive ovarian cancer patients who underwent elective surgery were investigated. The demographic data and clinical information related to the oncologic treatment were collected in the electronic and physical case records and included the following: age, ethnic group, comorbidities, staging of cancer, surgical procedure details, lymphadenectomy, American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) grade, anesthetic technique, operative blood loss, operative time, and residual disease. A radiologist, who was blinded to patient outcomes, performed quantitative assessment of psoas muscle areas using the available computed tomography scan images at the caudal end of the third lumbar vertebra. RESULTS: The mean age was 61.2 ± 18.2 years, and the percentage of patients over 65 years was 78%. Comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal insufficiency) were seen in 37 patients (49%). Histological types were adenocarcinoma in all patients (0) mostly serous adenocarcinoma (62%) and stage 3 (58%). According to psoas muscle measurement, 55 patients (73%) were nonsarcopenic and 20 patients (26%) were sarcopenic. Debulking procedures were performed on all patients. Also, bowel resection was applied in 40% of patients. Preoperative anesthetic examinations had shown that they were mostly ASA score 2 (44 patients). Moreover, 26 patients were ASA score 3. Generally, total operative time was between 121-240 minutes, and total blood loss was generally under 500 ml. Postoperative complications were seen in 26% of the patients. Non-surgical complications were observed in 14% of the patients, while non-surgical complications were observed in 12%. Length of the hospital stay >10 days was seen in 10 patients. Mortality was seen in 1 patient 30 days after operation. Nonsurgical complications (pneumonia, urinary tract infections, cardiac complications) were significantly higher in comparison to nonsarcopenic patients. However surgical complications were comparable between each group. Mortality after hospitalization and length of hospital stay were significantly higher in sarcopenic patients in comparison with the nonsarcopenic group. CONCLUSIONS: The use of the value of the psoas muscle region is considered to be a method to predict the in-hospital mortality when there is an available abdominal CT scan that has already been performed for ovarian cancer patients with a significant comparable clinical and laboratory background. According to the findings, patients had worse surgical outcomes and higher postoperative nonsurgical complication rate when sarcopenic patients were compared to nonsarcopenic patients. Moreover, postoperative mortality and length of hospital stay were significantly higher in sarcopenic patients in comparison to non-sarcopenic group.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16906,Search update 2023-11-13,,

P.",Preoperative Point-of-Care Ultrasound to Identify Frailty and Predict Postoperative Outcomes: A Diagnostic Accuracy Study,"BACKGROUND: Frailty is increasingly being recognized as a public health issue, straining healthcare resources and increasing costs to care for these patients. Frailty is the decline in physical and cognitive reserves leading to increased vulnerability to stressors such as surgery or disease states. The goal of this pilot diagnostic accuracy study was to identify whether point-of-care ultrasound measurements of the quadriceps and rectus femoris muscles can be used to discriminate between frail and not-frail patients and predict postoperative outcomes. This study hypothesized that ultrasound could discriminate between frail and not-frail patients before surgery. METHODS: Preoperative ultrasound measurements of the quadriceps and rectus femoris were obtained in patients with previous computed tomography scans. Using the computed tomography scans, psoas muscle area was measured in all patients for comparative purposes. Frailty was identified using the Fried phenotype assessment. Postoperative outcomes included unplanned intensive care unit admission, delirium, intensive care unit length of stay, hospital length of stay, unplanned skilled nursing facility admission, rehospitalization, falls within 30 days, and all-cause 30-day and 1-yr mortality. RESULTS: A total of 32 patients and 20 healthy volunteers were included. Frailty was identified in 18 of the 32 patients. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that quadriceps depth and psoas muscle area are able to identify frailty (area under the curve-receiver operating characteristic, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.64 to 0.97] and 0.88 [95% CI, 0.76 to 1.00], respectively), whereas the cross-sectional area of the rectus femoris is less promising (area under the curve-receiver operating characteristic, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.49 to 0.91]). Quadriceps depth was also associated with unplanned postoperative skilled nursing facility discharge disposition (area under the curve 0.81 [95% CI, 0.61 to 1.00]) and delirium (area under the curve 0.89 [95% CI, 0.77 to 1.00]). CONCLUSIONS: Similar to computed tomography measurements of psoas muscle area, preoperative ultrasound measurements of quadriceps depth shows promise in discriminating between frail and not-frail patients before surgery. It was also associated with skilled nursing facility admission and postoperative delirium.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 6771,Search update 2023-11-13,,

The incidence of shivering has been reported to range from 5% to 65% under general anaesthesia and as 33% during epidural anaesthesia. Shivering can increase perioperative risk in patients. Both dexmedetomidine and meperidine are effective agents for the prevention of postanaesthetic shivering. However, few studies have compared the anti-shivering effects of different agents following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). This study aims to compare the effects of dexmedetomidine and meperidine on the incidence of shivering in patients undergoing CABG.Methods and analysisA total of 180 patients aged 18-75 years, with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade of II-IV, undergoing elective CABG will be enrolled and randomly assigned to the dexmedetomidine, meperidine and control groups (placebo) in an intended 1:1:1 allocation ratio. The patients will be followed up for 7 days after surgery. The primary outcome is the incidence of shivering within 24 hours postoperatively. The secondary outcomes are the number of remedial drugs used after surgery, the incidence of postoperative hypotension and bradycardia, sedation scores, endotracheal extubation time, intensive care unit length of stay, incidence of postoperative delirium within 7 days after surgery, incidence of postoperative arrhythmias, incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, average hospital length of stay and mortality rate 30 days after surgery.Ethics and disseminationThe study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University on 20 January 2021 (YXLL-KY-2021(002)) and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov.

A conservative management is common in elderly to reduce surgery-related risks, however watchful waiting can expose to obstruction and strangulation. The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of emergency surgery in a large series of elderly with complicated groin hernia and to identify the independent risk factors for postoperative morbidity and mortality. The predictive performance of prognostic risk scores has been also assessed. METHODS: This is a prospective observational study carried out between January 2017 and June 2018 in elderly patients who underwent emergency surgery for complicated hernia in 38 Italian hospitals. Pre-operative, surgical and postoperative data were recorded for each patient. ASA score, Charlson's comorbidity index, P-POSSUM and CR-POSSUM were assessed. RESULTS: 259 patients were recruited, mean age was 80 years. A direct repair without mesh was performed in 62 (23.9%) patients. Explorative laparotomy was performed in 56 (21.6%) patients and bowel resection was necessary in 44 (17%). Mortality occurred in seven (2.8%) patients. Fifty-five (21.2%) patients developed complications, 12 of whom had a major one. At univariate and multivariate analyses, Charlson's comorbidity index ≥ 6, altered mental status, and need for laparotomy were associated with major complications and mortality CONCLUSION: Emergency surgery for complicated hernia is burdened by high morbidity and mortality in elderly patients.

This study aims to determine the impact of preoperative depression on PROs in single vs multilevel ACDF procedures. Methods: Eligible primary single or multilevel ACDF procedures were retrospectively reviewed from 2015 to 2020 using a surgical database. PROs included visual analog scale (VAS), Neck Disability Index (NDI), 12-Item Short Form Physical Composite Summary and Mental Composite Summary (SF-12 PCS and MCS), and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System physical function (PROMIS PF). PROs were collected preoperatively and at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year postoperatively. Patients were stratified into 3 groups based on Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score. Differences in PROs were assessed based on preoperative depression severity or both preoperative depression severity and number of operative levels. Results: Our patient cohort included 42 individuals with minimal preoperative depressive symptoms, 32 having mild and 27 having moderate to severe. Baseline PRO values were significantly different between groups (all P < 0.01). Improvement significantly differed between groups at 6 weeks for VAS arm, NDI, and SF-12 MCS (all P < 0.05), and at 12 wweeks for VAS neck, NDI, SF-12 PCS and MCS, and PROMIS PF (all P < 0.05). SF-12 PCS and MCS at 6 months and VAS arm and SF-12 MCS at 1 year demonstrated significant intergroup differences (all P < 0.05). VAS arm at 1 year (P = 0.029), NDI at 12 weeks (P = 0.034), PROMIS PF at 6 weeks (P = 0.038), and SF-MCS at all postoperative time points were impacted by both preoperative depression severity and number of levels fused. Conclusion: Depression severity impacted recovery of pain, disability, and physical function preoperatively and at intermittent postoperative time points. Both severity and multilevel procedures impacted pain and mental health at intermittent postoperative time points.

C.",Surgical outcome of male patients with chronic central nervous system disorders and voiding dysfunction due to bladder outlet obstruction,"PURPOSE: Voiding dysfunction is common in patients with chronic central nervous system (CNS) diseases and has great impact on quality of life. Patients with chronic CNS disorders might have concomitant detrusor overactivity, detrusor underactivity, and voiding dysfunction. Although bladder outlet surgeries could relieve bladder outlet obstruction (BOO), patients might have persistent or exacerbated storage symptoms. This study investigated surgical outcome of patients with chronic CNS disorders after bladder outlet surgery. METHODS: A total of 63 male patients with cerebrovascular accident (CVA, n = 44), Parkinson's disease (PD, n = 11), and early-stage dementia (n = 8), had received bladder outlet surgery after videourodynamic proven BOO refractory to medical treatment. The preoperative and postoperative lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and uroflowmetry parameters were assessed. If the storage symptom subscore decreased or increased by 1, the outcome was considered improved or exacerbated after treatment. When patients had improvement in maximum flow rate (Qmax) and voiding efficiency (VE) and decreased voiding symptom subscore, they were considered having improvement of voiding dysfunction. RESULTS: The mean age was 71.1 ± 9.8 years and mean duration from diagnosis of BOO to surgical intervention was 15.1 ± 25.0 months. Overall, there was significant improvement in voiding LUTS and urinary retention after surgery. The post-void residual volume (PVR), corrected Qmax (cQmax), and VE significantly improved after surgery. In subgroup analysis, although voiding symptoms improved in CVA patients, urgency and exacerbated urgency incontinence persisted after surgery. In PD patients, there was improvement in voiding condition such as PVR, cQmax and VE, but the storage symptoms did not change after surgery. Patients with dementia had no improvement both in storage and voiding symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Bladder outlet surgeries are effective to relieve voiding dysfunction in patients with CVA and PD, but have little effect on storage LUTS in patients with chronic brain lesions.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16929,Search update 2023-11-13,,

A.",The Association of Preoperative Hematocrit With Adverse Events Following Exploratory Laparotomy in Septic Patients: A Retrospective Analysis,"Background: Sepsis continues to be the leading cause of death in intensive care units and surgical patients comprise almost one third of all sepsis patients. Anemia is a modifiable risk factor for worse postoperative outcomes in sepsis patients. Here we aim to evaluate the association of preoperative anemia and postoperative mortality in sepsis patients undergoing exploratory laparotomy. Methods: The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program registry was used to query for preoperative sepsis patients undergoing exploratory laparotomy between 2014 and 2016. Preoperative hematocrit was stratified into 4 categories: ≥30% to polycythemia, <21%, 21 and less than 30%, and polycythemia. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of preoperative hematocrit with primary and secondary endpoints. The multivariable analysis included preoperative hematocrit, gender, age, BMI, smoking status, functional status, hypertension, steroid use, bleeding disorder, and sepsis. The odds ratio (OR) with associated 95% confidence interval (CI) is reported for all outcomes. A p-value of less than <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The unadjusted 30-day death rate was the highest for patients with preoperative hematocrit <21% (p < 0.001) compared to the other hematocrit cohorts. The odds of 30-day death was significantly increased for patients with preoperative hematocrit <21% (OR 2.39 95% CI: 1.28-4.49, p = 0.006) and 21-30% (OR 1.35, 95% CI: 1.05 -1.72, p = 0.017) compared to patients with preoperative hematocrit of ≥30% and less than polycythemic ranges (reference cohort). Conclusion: Preoperative anemia in sepsis patients undergoing surgery can lead to increased mortality, postoperative complications, and length of hospital stay. Diagnosing sepsis early in the hospital course can allow physicians more time to titrate anticoagulation medications and treat preoperative anemia. © The Author(s) 2020.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16344,Search update 2023-11-13,,

We aimed to evaluate preoperative oral saline administration on postoperative delirium in older persons undergoing spinal decompression. DESIGN: A randomised controlled trial in a large tertiary hospital. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 76 older persons (≧65 years old) undergoing spinal surgery from May 2020 to January 2021. METHODS: Older persons (65-83 years old) who underwent elective spinal canal decompression were randomly grouped into either the control group (n = 38) or the intervention group (n = 38). The control group was forbidden from drinking 8 hours prior to the operation while the intervention group was administered 5 mL·kg(-1) of normal saline 2 hours before anesthesia. Hemodynamic indicators, diagnostic biomarkers, preoperative mini-mental status scores, and intraoperative fluid dynamics were recorded at baseline and at various postoperative timepoints. Subjects were then scored for POD and postoperative pain. RESULTS: S100β protein was lowered in S(1) (F(S1) = 12.289, P <0.001) and S(2) (F(S2) = 12.440, P <0.001) in the intervention group while mean arterial blood pressure (F(T1)= 42.997, P<0.001) and heart rate (F(T1)= 8.974, P=0.004) were increased. The Ln c-reactive protein of the intervention group was lowered 1 day postoperatively (F(S2) = 6.305, P = 0.014). The incidence of postoperative delirium in the control group was higher than in the intervention group (27.8% vs 8.3%, χ (2) = 4.547, P = 0.033).

Given its relatively high frequency and negative impact on patients’ physical and mental status, efforts preoperatively to confirm patients at risk of developing PAP to offer more efficient pain management to minimize this complication have a high priority. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of preoperative dynamic quantitative sensory testing (QST) in predicting the PAP after posterior cervical decompression. Methods: This longitudinal observational study included 122 patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy undergoing laminoplasty or laminectomy. Preoperatively, all patients underwent the assessment of pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) at local and remote pain-free areas and both temporal summation (TS) and conditioned pain modulation (CPM) at remote pain free-areas. These patients underwent further pain-related, psychosocial and clinical function assessments before and/or after operation. Results: In the present study, 21 patients (21/122, 17.2%) developed PAP, and the 6-month postoperative follow-up demonstrated that 8 of these 21 patients developed chronic PAP (CPAP). All preoperative covariates with significant differences between the PAP and non-PAP groups were subjected to multivariate logistic regression, and the presence of preoperative axial pain, surgical plan including C2 decompression, total international physical activity questionnaire score (cutoff value [CV]: 2205.5, sensitivity: 82.4%; specificity: 61.1%) and TS value (CV: 2.5, sensitivity: 42.9%; specificity: 83.2%) were independently associated with PAP (P < 0.05). Logistic regression further revealed that the presence of preoperative axial pain, TS value (CV: 2.5, sensitivity: 62.5%; specificity: 83.2%) and CPM value (CV: 0.65, sensitivity: 87.5%; specificity: 61.4%) were significant predictors of CPAP (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The findings of this study support the hypothesis that preoperative endogenous pain modulation efficiency may be associated with axial pain after posterior cervical decompression. Clinically, preoperative estimation of both TS and CPM in remote pain-free areas may provide additional useful information for identifying patients who may be at risk of developing both PAP and CPAP, which may be beneficial in enabling stratification in the perioperative period of patients based on individual vulnerabilities to avoid/reduce this complication. © 2022, The Author(s).",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16346,Search update 2023-11-13,,

The quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk Bias Tool for RCTs and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational cohort studies. RESULTS: Fifty-three studies (196,491 patients) were included. Preoperative CI was associated with a significant risk of delirium in older patients after non-cardiac surgery (25.1% vs. 10.3%; OR: 3.84; 95%CI: 2.35, 6.26; I(2): 76%; p < 0.00001).

Over- or under-anesthetizing patients can lead to complications such as postoperative cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients, or procedural discomfort, respectively. Our scoping review focuses on the current evidence regarding the association between preoperative anxiety and intraoperative anesthetic and/or postoperative analgesic consumption in patients undergoing elective surgical or interventional procedures. Based on 44 studies that met the inclusion criteria, we found that preoperative anxiety has a significant positive correlation effect on intraoperative propofol and postoperative opioid consumption. The analysis of the literature is limited by the heterogeneity of preoperative anxiety tools used, study designs, data analyses, and outcomes. The use of shorter, validated preoperative anxiety assessment tools may help optimize the intraoperative anesthetic and postoperative analgesic regimen.

Design: Open-label randomized trial. Setting: Single center. Participants: A total of 70 patients older than 75 years without English language limitations and Mini Mental State Examination scores >20. Interventions: Patients received either propofol (group P) or dexmedetomidine (group D) postoperatively until normothermic and hemodynamically stable. Measurements and Main Results: Quality of recovery (QoR) was measured by the QoR-40 questionnaire on postoperative day (POD) three. Secondary outcomes were incidence and duration of delirium, time to extubation, length of hospital stay, hospital mortality rate, postoperative quality of life (QoL; measured by SF-36 performed at baseline and six months postoperatively), and neurocognitive disorder (measured by Minnesota Cognitive Acuity Screen [MCAS] performed at baseline, POD5, and six months postoperatively). A total of sixty-seven patients completed the trial. There was no significant difference in QoR-40 scores (95% confidence interval [CI], –7.6081-to-10.9781; p = 1.000), incidence of delirium (group P, 42%; group D, 24%; p = 0.191), mean hospital stay (95% CI, –5.4838-to-1.5444; p = 0.297), mean time to extubation (95% CI, –19.2513-to-7.5561; p = 0.866), or mean duration of delirium (95% CI, –4.3065-to-1.067; p = 0.206) between groups. No patients died in the hospital. There were no significant differences in changes in SF-36 or MCAS scores over time between groups. There was a decline in MCAS score from preoperatively to POD5 in group P (95% CI, –8.95725-to- –2.61775; p = 0.0005), which was greater than that observed in group D. Conclusions: The authors' findings demonstrated that the use of dexmedetomidine compared with propofol in elderly patients undergoing cardiac surgery was unlikely to improve QoR/postoperative QoL. Although the study was underpowered to detect secondary outcomes, the results suggested no reductions in delirium, time to extubation, and hospital stay, but a potential decrease in delayed neurocognitive recovery.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 7240,Search update 2023-11-13,,

DESIGN: A prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled, non-inferiority trial. SETTING: An operating room, a post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), and a hospital ward. PATIENTS: Female patients (n = 140; 20-65 years) scheduled for open thyroidectomy were enrolled and randomly assigned to the remimazolam or propofol group. INTERVENTIONS: The remimazolam group received continuous remimazolam infusions and effect-site target-controlled remifentanil infusions. The propofol group received effect-site target-controlled infusions of propofol and remifentanil. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was QoR-15 on postoperative day 1 (POD1). The mean difference between the groups was compared against a non-inferiority margin of -8. Secondary outcomes were QoR-15 on POD2, hemodynamic data, time to lose and recover consciousness, sedation score upon PACU admission, pain, and postoperative nausea and vomiting profiles at the PACU and ward. Group-time interaction effects in hemodynamic data and QoR-15 were analyzed using a linear mixed model. MAIN RESULTS: The total QoR-15 score on POD1 in the remimazolam group was non-inferior to that in the propofol group (mean [SD] 111.2 [18.8] vs. 109.1 [18.9]; mean difference [95% CI] 2.1 [-4.2, 8.5]; p = 0.002 for non-inferiority). The QoR-15 score on POD2 was comparable between the groups, and no group-time interaction was observed. At the end of anesthesia, after extubation, and upon arrival at the PACU, mean arterial pressure was significantly higher in the remimazolam group. Remimazolam group was more sedated at the time of admission to PACU. Pain intensity and the requirement for analgesics were lower in the remimazolam group than in the propofol group. CONCLUSIONS: Remimazolam-based total intravenous anesthesia provided a similar QoR to propofol. Remimazolam and propofol can be used interchangeably for general anesthesia in female patients undergoing thyroid surgery.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16700,Search update 2023-11-13,,

M.",Functional and cognitive outcomes after suprapubic catheter placement in nursing home residents: A national cohort study,"BACKGROUND: Long-term functional and cognitive outcomes in nursing home residents after procedures are poorly understood. Our objective was to evaluate these outcomes after suprapubic tube (SPT) placement. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, cohort study in the nursing home setting. Participants were long-term nursing home residents who underwent SPT placement from 2014 to 2016 in the United States. SPT placements were identified in Medicare Inpatient, Outpatient, and Carrier files using International Classification of Diseases and Current Procedural Terminology codes. Residents were identified through the Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0 for Nursing Home Residents. MDS Activities of Daily Living (MDS-ADL) and Brief Interview for Mental Status (BIMS) scores were used to assess function and cognition, respectively. Outcomes of interest were worsening MDS-ADL and BIMS scores at 1 year postoperatively, 30-day postoperative complications, and 1-year mortality. Functional and cognitive trajectories were modeled to 1 year postoperatively using mixed-effect spline models. RESULTS: From 2014 to 2016, 9647 residents with a mean age of 80.9 (SD 8.1) years underwent SPT placement. At 1 year postoperatively, 37.6% of residents died, while of survivors, 33.7% had worsening MDS-ADL and 36.2% worsened BIMS. Residents had steeper postoperative rates of functional decline compared to relatively stable preoperative trends that never recovered to baseline status. However, robustly characterizing an association between SPT placement and functional decline would require a propensity score matched cohort without SPT placement. Decline in cognitive status was not clearly associated with SPT placement, suggesting either the natural course of a vulnerable population or limitations of BIMS scores. CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes important to older adults, such as functional ability and cognitive status, do not show improvement after SPT placement. These findings emphasize that this ""minor"" procedure should be considered with caution in this population and primarily for palliation.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16348,Search update 2023-11-13,,

G., Berger, M.",A Processed Electroencephalogram-Based Brain Anesthetic Resistance Index Is Associated With Postoperative Delirium in Older Adults: A Dual Center Study,"BACKGROUND: Some older adults show exaggerated responses to drugs that act on the brain. The brain's response to anesthetic drugs is often measured clinically by processed electroencephalogram (EEG) indices. Thus, we developed a processed EEG-based measure of the brain's resistance to volatile anesthetics and hypothesized that low scores on it would be associated with postoperative delirium risk. METHODS: We defined the Duke Anesthesia Resistance Scale (DARS) as the average bispectral index (BIS) divided by the quantity (2.5 minus the average age-adjusted end-tidal minimum alveolar concentration [aaMAC] inhaled anesthetic fraction). The relationship between DARS and postoperative delirium was analyzed in 139 older surgical patients (age ≥65) from Duke University Medical Center (n = 69) and Mt Sinai Medical Center (n = 70). Delirium was assessed by geriatrician interview at Duke, and by research staff utilizing the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) instrument at Mt Sinai. We examined the relationship between DARS and delirium and used the Youden index to identify an optimal low DARS threshold (for delirium risk), and its associated 95% bootstrap confidence bounds. We used multivariable logistic regression to examine the relationship between low DARS and delirium risk. RESULTS: The relationship between DARS and delirium risk was nonlinear, with higher delirium risk at low DARS scores. A DARS threshold of 28.755 maximized the Youden index for the association between low DARS and delirium, with bootstrap 95% confidence bounds of 26.18 and 29.80. A low DARS (<28.755) was associated with increased delirium risk in multivariable models adjusting for site (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval {CI}] = 4.30 [1.89-10.01]; P = .001), or site-plus-patient risk factors (OR [95% CI] = 3.79 [1.63-9.10]; P = .003). These associations with postoperative delirium risk remained significant when using the 95% bootstrap confidence bounds for the low DARS threshold (P < .05 for all). Further, a low DARS (<28.755) was associated with delirium risk after accounting for opioid, midazolam, propofol, phenylephrine, and ketamine dosage as well as site (OR [95% CI] = 4.21 [1.80-10.16]; P = .002). This association between low DARS and postoperative delirium risk after controlling for these other medications remained significant (P < .05) when using either the lower or the upper 95% bootstrap confidence bounds for the low DARS threshold. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that an intraoperative processed EEG-based measure of lower brain anesthetic resistance (ie, low DARS) is independently associated with increased postoperative delirium risk in older surgical patients.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 3590,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Frailty in patients undergoing lower extremity amputation has been associated with increased short-term mortality. We compared 2 frailty scores, modified Frailty Index (mFI) and Risk Analysis Index (RAI), to evaluate the short- and long-term mortality stratified by frailty status after lower extremity amputation. METHODS: A retrospective review at a single Veterans Affairs Medical Center was performed for all patients with peripheral vascular disease that underwent an above or below the knee amputation from 2014 to 2019. Preoperative variables were obtained to calculate the mFI and RAI frailty scores. The frailty scoring systems were used to separate the patients into 3 cohorts: non-frail (mFI <0.45, RAI <20), frail (mFI 0.45-0.55; RAI 20-32), and very frail (mFI >0.55, RAI >32). The frailty groups with each scoring system were compared for 30-day outcomes (readmission, reoperation, adverse events, length of stay) and short- and long-term mortality. RESULTS: A total of 298 patients underwent lower extremity amputation. The number of non-frail patients was 98 (RAI) and 102 (mFI); frail patients 99 (RAI), and 123 (mFI); very frail patients 101 (RAI) and 73 (mFI). For the 30-day outcomes, only length of stay (mFI) was associated with increasing frailty. The short- and long-term mortality was associated with a worse survival with increasing frailty. At 1-year, the mortality by RAI was non-frail 8%; frail 24%, very frail 43% (P < 0.001); the mortality by mFI was non-frail 16%, frail 24%, very frail 41% (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative frailty scoring systems identify patients with worse short- and long-term mortality for lower extremity amputation. Frailty scoring should be considered as a screening tool for patients with peripheral vascular disease undergoing lower extremity amputation because of the high rate of frail and very frail patients. The frailty status may provide a more patient-centered approach to counsel patients and their families on the risks and benefits of amputation.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16910,Search update 2023-11-13,,

G.",The Perioperative Use of Benzodiazepines for Major Orthopedic Surgery in the United States,"BACKGROUND: Despite numerous indications for perioperative benzodiazepine use, associated risks may be exacerbated in elderly and comorbid patients. In the absence of national utilization data, we aimed to describe utilization patterns using national claims data from total hip/knee arthroplasty patients (THA/TKA), an increasingly older and vulnerable surgical population. METHODS: We included data on 1,863,996 TKAs and 985,471 THAs (Premier Healthcare claims data, 2006-2019). Benzodiazepine utilization (stratified by long- and short-acting agents) was assessed by patient- and health care characteristics, and analgesic regimens. Given the large sample size, standardized differences instead of P values were utilized to signify meaningful differences between groups (defined by value >0.1). RESULTS: Among 1,863,996 TKA and 985,471 THA patients, the utilization rate of benzodiazepines was 80.5% and 76.1%, respectively. In TKA, 72.6% received short-acting benzodiazepines, while 7.9% received long-acting benzodiazepines, utilization rates 68.4% and 7.7% in THA, respectively. Benzodiazepine use was particularly more frequent among younger patients (median age [interquartile range {IQR}]: 66 [60-73]/64 [57-71] among short/long-acting compared to 69 [61-76] among nonusers), White patients (80.6%/85.4% short/long-acting versus 75.7% among nonusers), commercial insurance (36.5%/34.0% short/long-acting versus 29.1% among nonusers), patients receiving neuraxial anesthesia (56.9%/56.5% short/long-acting versus 51.5% among nonusers), small- and medium-sized (≤500 beds) hospitals (68.5% in nonusers, and 74% and 76.7% in short- and long-acting benzodiazepines), and those in the Midwest (24.6%/25.4% short/long-acting versus 16% among nonusers) in TKA; all standardized differences ≥0.1. Similar patterns were observed in THA except for race and comorbidity burden. Notably, among patients with benzodiazepine use, in-hospital postoperative opioid administration (measured in oral morphine equivalents [OMEs]) was substantially higher. This was even more pronounced in patients who received long-acting agents (median OME with no benzodiazepines utilization 192 [IQR, 83-345] vs 256 [IQR, 153-431] with short-acting, and 329 [IQR, 195-540] with long-acting benzodiazepine administration). Benzodiazepine use was also more frequent in patients receiving multimodal analgesia (concurrently 2 or more analgesic modes) and regional anesthesia. Trend analysis showed a persistent high utilization rate of benzodiazepines over the last 14 years. CONCLUSIONS: Based on a representative sample, 4 of 5 patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery in the United States receive benzodiazepines perioperatively, despite concerns for delirium and delayed postoperative neurocognitive recovery. Notably, benzodiazepine utilization was coupled with substantially increased opioid use, which may project implications for perioperative pain management.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 9034,Search update 2023-11-13,,

This study examines the associations between two different preoperative functional status metrics with postoperative outcomes in the geriatric population. METHODS: Patients who participated in the ACS NSQIP Geriatric Surgery Research File pilot program (2014-2018) undergoing elective pancreatic operations were included. Two clinically meaningful functional status scores were calculated: the presence of one or more geriatric-specific variable (GSV) and a 5-factor modified frailty index (mFI-5). Multivariable logistic regression adjusting for ACS NSQIP-estimated risk was performed to evaluate associations between preoperative GSV, mFI-5 and 30-day outcome measures. RESULTS: A total of 1266 patients were included: 808 (64%) age 65-74, 302 (24%) age 75-80, and 156 (12%) age ≥ 81; 843 (67%) patients underwent pancreatoduodenectomy.

This study aims to explore the functional limitations following first MTPJ arthrodesis, overall satisfaction and patient's abilities to achieve activities of daily living (ADL). This prospective cohort study assessed functional limitations as well as footwear and lifestyle restrictions using several questionnaires. One hundred and three participants who had a first MTPJ arthrodesis under the care of a single surgeon were recruited. Pre- and postoperative patient-reported outcome measures were recorded. The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) and the Manchester-Oxford Foot Questionnaire were also used to further examine functional status. Hallux valgus angle (HVA) and intermetatarsal angle (IMA) were compared using preoperative and postoperative weightbearing radiographs and successful fusion was recorded. Complications were documented and are discussed in detail. The duration of follow-up was more than 12 months. There was one nonunion in the cohort while 2 patients experienced delay to fusion. Approximately 97% of patients were very satisfied with the procedure and their ability to achieve ADLs post operatively. A further 82.5% of patients were able to return to wearing nonadaptive footwear. The mean reduction in HVA and IMA was 21.78° and 6.84°, respectively. This study demonstrates the safe and successful use of a compression screw/locking plate construct for arthrodesis of the first MTPJ.

Consequently, frailty is common in patients undergoing TAVR. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the impact of frailty on outcomes following TAVR. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted, including all TAVR candidates who visited the geriatric outpatient clinic for preoperative screening. Frailty status was assessed according to the Groningen Frailty Indicator. The primary outcome of the study was defined as the occurrence of postoperative complications, and this was evaluated according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. An additional analysis was performed to assess the impact of frailty on 1-year all-cause mortality and complications within 30 days of TAVR according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC-2) criteria. The VARC-2 criteria provide harmonized endpoint definitions for TAVR studies. RESULTS: In total, 431 patients with a mean age of 80.8 ± 6.2 years were included, of whom 56% were female.

Patients and methods: Our study recruited 682 and 761 cognitively intact individuals from the perioperative neurocognitive disorder risk factor and prognosis (PNDRFAP) study and the perioperative neurocognitive disorder and biomarker lifestyle (PNDABLE) study, respectively. The incidence of POD was evaluated by using Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), and POD severity was measured by using the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS). Logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between BMI and POD. The levels of Aβ40, Aβ42, T-tau, and P-tau in preoperative CSF were measured by enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA) in the PNDABLE study. Mediation analysis with 5000 bootstrapped iterations was used to explore the mediation effects. Results: In the PNDRFAP study, the incidence of POD was 16.3%, with logistic regression analysis showing that BMI (odds ratio [OR] = 0.900, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.823–0.985, p =.022) is a protective factor of POD. In the PNDABLE study, the incidence of POD was 18.7%, and regression analysis confirmed that BMI (OR = 0.832, 95% CI 0.761–0.910, p <.001) is a protective factor of POD, while T-tau (OR = 1.005, 95% CI 1.003–1.006, p <.001) and P-tau (OR = 1.037, 95% CI 1.024–1.050, p <.001) were risk factors of POD. Mediation analyses revealed that the association between BMI and POD was partially mediated by T-tau (proportion: 36%) and P-tau (proportion: 24%).

The purpose of this study was to observe the effect of transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) before surgery and during surgery in elderly patients with POD. Materials and Methods: A total of 90 patients were randomly divided into three groups: a preoperative TEAS group (group E1), an intraoperative TEAS group (group E2), and a control group (group C). In group E1, TEAS was applied at the Shenting, Baihui, bilateral Neiguan, and Hegu points for 30 min 1 day before surgery and before the induction of anesthesia. In group E2, TEAS was applied during surgery. In group C, electrodes were applied to the points just cited, but no electric stimulation was administered. The incidence of delirium was assessed within 5 days after surgery, and the plasma concentration of propofol at bispectral index (BIS) = 50 was recorded. Blood samples were collected to measure neuron-specific enolation (NSE), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin (IL)-1β 1 day before surgery and 1 and 5 days after surgery. Results: The incidence of delirium in group E1 was decreased in comparison with group C and group E1 (both p < 0.05). The propofol plasma concentration at BIS = 50 in group E1 was also decreased in comparison with group C and group E2 (both p < 0.05). Compared with group C, the concentrations of NSE, TNF-α, and IL-1β in plasma were decreased in group E1 and group E2 1 and 5 days after surgery (both p < 0.05), and the concentrations of NSE and IL-1β in plasma in group E1 were decreased 1 and 5 days after surgery in comparison with group E2. Conclusion: The TEAS can reduce the dosage of propofol required during surgery and the occurrence of delirium after surgery. Its mechanism may be related to inhibiting inflammation response and alleviating brain injury. Compared with intraoperative application, the effect of preconditioning with TEAS before surgery is better. Clinical Trial Registration: ChiCTR-INR-17012501.

The DEX group was intravenously pumped at a rate of 0.8 μg/kg/h for 10 min and then continuously pumped at a rate of 0.3 μg/kg/h until 40 min before the end of the operation. The two groups were given the same amount of normal saline, with the same way of anesthesia. The results showed that the visual analog scale (VAS) score of pain in the two groups decreased signally. Compared with the control group, the inflammatory factors tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP-2) in the DEX group were remarkably decreased at T1 and T2 stages, with a considerable difference (P < 0.05). One month after the auxiliary diagnosis of colorectal tumor, no clear nodular, irregular shape patches, or patchy diffuse limited points were found, which indicated that the whole tumor had been removed. In summary, DEX could improve postoperative cognitive function in elderly patients who underwent the laparoscopic radical resection of colon cancer, and its mechanism was related to the reduction of inflammatory factors. Therefore, the anesthesia intervention with DEX during the operation had a positive significance for tumor resection.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16753,Search update 2023-11-13,,

No previous studies, to our knowledge, have analyzed preoperative resilience and patient reported outcomes in lumbar spinal fusion. Methods: Patients undergoing lumbar spinal fusion completed the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) preoperatively, in addition to measures of disability (Oswestry Disability index [ODI]), quality of life (PROMIS global physical and mental health scales and EuroQol5), and leg and back pain (VAS) at pre- and 3-months postoperatively. The 3-month follow-up was selected due to the association with return to work. Multiple linear regression evaluated relationships between resilience and postoperative changes in outcomes measures, controlling for baseline values and body mass index, age, number of levels fused, and severity of comorbidities. Results: Ninety-five participants (mean age 58 years, 56% male) completed the BRS preoperatively and outcome measures before and 3 months after lumbar fusion. On average, participants reported significant postoperative improvements on all outcome measures (P < 0.001). Higher preoperative resilience scores related to greater postoperative improvements in back and leg pain, global mental and physical health and EuroQol scores (P < 0.05), after controlling for baseline values and other covariates. Resilience scores did not significantly correlate with postoperative changes in ODI (P > 0.05). Conclusions: Preoperative resilience is associated with improvement in pain and physical and mental health quality of life during the early postoperative period following lumbar spinal fusion. Additional research is needed to determine if improvements are maintained beyond this interval and whether resilience can be modified to optimize outcomes. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16356,Search update 2023-11-13,,

F., Wang, Q.",Combined sevoflurane-dexmedetomidine and nerve blockade on post-surgical serum oxidative stress biomarker levels in thyroid cancer patients,"BACKGROUND The incidence of thyroid cancer is increasing annually. Clinical routine thyroid surgery can be performed under a cervical plexus block, but cannot mediate the stress response during the surgery. If thyroid surgery is performed under nerve block, an inappropriate level of blockade may occur. Similarly, the stress response caused by surgery is more serious than that caused by conventional anesthesia. Therefore, it is important to combine blockade with more effective anesthesia methods. AIM To investigate the effects of combining sevoflurane-dexmedetomidine inhalation general anesthesia with the cervical plexus nerve block on the post-surgical levels of the serum oxidative stress biomarkers levels in thyroid cancer patients. METHODS We enrolled 96 thyroid cancer patients admitted to the hospital between January 2019 and December 2020. Participants were divided into a control group (n = 47) and an experimental group (n = 49). The experimental group received a combination of inhaled sevoflurane-dexmedetomidine and cervical plexus block, while the control group received conventional general anesthesia. The groups were compared for serum levels of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) before and after surgery, and the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and norepinephrine (NE) levels at 1 and 12 h postsurgery. The Bispectral index (BIS) and the incidence of anesthesia side effects were also compared. RESULTS Following surgery, MCP-1 was significantly lower in the experimental group compared to the control group, whereas GSH-Px was significantly higher than that in the control group (P < 0.001). The serum ACTH and NE levels were significantly lower in the experimental group than those the control group at 1 and 12 h post-surgery (P < 0.001). BIS was significantly lower in the experimental group than that in the control group at 20 minutes into the operation, but the direction of the difference was reversed at eye opening (P < 0.001). The incidence of side effects was 10.20% (5/49) and 12.76% (6/47) in the experimental and control groups, respectively, the difference being non-significant. CONCLUSION Sevoflurane-dexmedetomidine inhalation general anesthesia combined with cervical plexus nerve block can reduce the postoperative stress and inflammatory responses in thyroid cancer patients, while maintaining high anesthesia effectiveness and safety.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16357,Search update 2023-11-13,,

The role of 2, 3-diphosphoglycerate is essential, because its increase in the concentration of red blood cells in hypoxic conditions is one of the adaptive mechanisms that improve oxygen transport to tissues. Purpose. The influence of the dynamics of 2,3 diphosphoglycerate content, as the main indicator of hypoxia, on the occurrence of cognitive dysfunction in the postoperative period in patients with neoplasms of the abdominal cavity. The study was conducted on the basis of departments for patients of the surgical profile of the municipal institution ""Kharkiv City Clinical Hospital of Ambulance and Emergency Care named after Professor OI Meshchaninov "". To achieve this goal, we examined 80 patients with abdominal neoplasms who underwent surgery under general anesthesia using propofol and fentanyl. All patients were divided into 2 groups depending on the age of patients on the WHO scale, who underwent surgery using general anesthesia: Group 1 (n = 39) - middle-aged patients (50-59 years); Group 2 (n = 41) - elderly and senile patients (60-80 years). The control points of the examination were the day before the operation and the 1st, 7th, 30th day from the moment of the operation. The state of cognitive function in these patients was determined by conducting neuropsychological tests. To assess the state of cognitive function of patients, neuropsychological tests were used: MMSE scale (Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE), the method of memorizing 10 words AR Luria, frontal dysfunction battery (FAB), Schulte technique. To assess the state of energy metabolism in patients, the level of erythrocytes and hemoglobin in the blood analysis was determined by well-known methods, the level of 2,3 diphosphoglycerate in erythrocytes and its ratio to hemoglobin. Anemia in the first week after surgery in patients of group 1 contributes to the development of a hypoxic state, in erythrocytes there is an increase in the content of 2,3 41 diphosphoglycerate, which promotes the transport of oxygen to tissues. During the week there is an increase in the intensity of the formation of 2,3 diphosphoglycerate, as evidenced by the ratio of 2,3 diphosphoglycerate to hemoglobin. In patients of group 2, the changes are more pronounced: anemia with a significant decrease in erythrocytes and hemoglobin in the blood, a decrease in 2.3 diphosphoglycerate in erythrocytes, reflects changes in erythrocyte metabolism, namely a decrease in biosynthesis of important organophosphorus compounds, in particular 2,3 diphosphogly by reducing the basic enzymes of glycolysis. Decreased energy metabolism in the elderly contributes to impaired cell function. With age, the content of adenosine triphosphate, 2,3 diphosphoglycerate decreases, thus increasing the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, impaired transport of oxygen to tissues, which leads to the development of hypoxia. According to the results of neuropsychological tests, we found postoperative cognitive dysfunction in patients with neoplasms of the abdominal cavity. Disruption of energy metabolism and changes in the activity of glycolysis enzymes in erythrocytes contributes to a decrease in the concentration of 2, 3 diphosphoglycerate, increase the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen and the development of tissue hypoxia. The obtained results indicate the interdependence of these processes and allow continuing research in this direction with the development of appropriate clinical and diagnostic measures and areas of intensive care to improve the condition of patients with abdominal tumors and their quality of life after surgery.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16957,Search update 2023-11-13,,

K.",Association Between Perioperative Medication Use and Postoperative Delirium and Cognition in Older Adults Undergoing Elective Noncardiac Surgery,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium is frequent in older adults and is associated with postoperative neurocognitive disorder (PND). Studies evaluating perioperative medication use and delirium have generally evaluated medications in aggregate and been poorly controlled; the association between perioperative medication use and PND remains unclear. We sought to evaluate the association between medication use and postoperative delirium and PND in older adults undergoing major elective surgery. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study of adults ≥70 years without dementia undergoing major elective surgery. Patients were interviewed preoperatively to determine home medication use. Postoperatively, daily hospital use of 7 different medication classes listed in guidelines as risk factors for delirium was collected; administration before delirium was verified. While hospitalized, patients were assessed daily for delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method and a validated chart review method. Cognition was evaluated preoperatively and 1 month after surgery using a neurocognitive battery. The association between prehospital medication use and postoperative delirium was assessed using a generalized linear model with a log link function, controlling for age, sex, type of surgery, Charlson comorbidity index, and baseline cognition. The association between daily postoperative medication use (when class exposure ≥5%) and time to delirium was assessed using time-varying Cox models adjusted for age, sex, surgery type, Charlson comorbidity index, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE)-II score, and baseline cognition. Mediation analysis was utilized to evaluate the association between medication use, delirium, and cognitive change from baseline to 1 month. RESULTS: Among 560 patients enrolled, 134 (24%) developed delirium during hospitalization. The multivariable analyses revealed no significant association between prehospital benzodiazepine (relative risk [RR], 1.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-2.44), beta-blocker (RR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.94-2.05), NSAID (RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.77-1.62), opioid (RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.82-1.82), or statin (RR, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.92-1.95) exposure and delirium. Postoperative hospital benzodiazepine use (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 3.23; 95% CI, 2.10-4.99) was associated with greater delirium. Neither postoperative hospital antipsychotic (aHR, 1.48; 95% CI, 0.74-2.94) nor opioid (aHR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.62-1.11) use before delirium was associated with delirium. Antipsychotic use (either presurgery or postsurgery) was associated with a 0.34 point (standard error, 0.16) decrease in general cognitive performance at 1 month through its effect on delirium (P = .03), despite no total effect being observed. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of benzodiazepines to older adults hospitalized after major surgery is associated with increased postoperative delirium.

Objectives: The effect of opioid-free anesthesia on POCD following urological surgery has not been previously reported. Accord-ingly, we present a case series of 15 adult patients undergoing transurethral urological surgery under general anesthesia using an opioid-free protocol with dexmedetomidine, ketamine, and lidocaine. Methods: Patients that underwent simple transurethral elective urological procedures under general opioid-free anesthesia were included.

We describe the first experience in the Netherlands of S-ICD implantation under Ultrasound-guided Serratus Anterior Plane Block (US-SAPB). Methods: US-SAPB was performed 1 hour before S-ICD implantation. The two-incision technique was used and a pocket beneath the latissimus dorsi muscle was surgically created. Lidocaine was used to provide anesthesia of the skin. Sedation during defibrillation testing (DFT) was induced by intravenous Propofol. Periprocedural pain experience was monitored using the Numerical Rating Scale for Pain (NRS-Pain). The results were compared with a control group of patients undergoing S-ICD implantation under GA. Results: Forty consecutive patients (29 Male/11 Female, median age 59 years (range 34–84 years), median body mass index 26 (range 17–41) underwent S-ICD implantation; Twenty patients under US-SAPB and twenty under GA.

Even though there is less postoperative pain with laparoscopic cholecystectomy than with open cholecystectomy, severe pain can occur, particularly within the first 24 hours. Evaluation of the efficacy of ultrasound-guided interfascial plane blocks for postoperative analgesia of laparoscopic cholecystectomy has recently come to prominence. The aim of our study was to compare the postoperative analgesic efficacy of thoracoabdominal nerves block through perichondrial approach (TAPA) and modified-TAPA (m-TAPA) blocks in patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The present study included 56 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia and received TAPA or m-TAPA block for perioperative analgesia. Each patient signed a written informed consent form. Block times and numerical rating scale (NRS) scores 1, 2, 3, and 12 hours postoperatively, hourly and total tramadol amount of use via the patient-controlled analgesia device, and additional analgesic drug consumption were all recorded. The TAPA group had significantly longer block application times than the m-TAPA group. At 1 and 12 hours, NRS scores were lower in the TAPA group. However, the mean NRS scores, total tramadol use, and use of additional analgesics were comparable between the groups. TAPA and m-TAPA block methods reduced NRS scores by alleviating pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures, thereby reducing the need for additional analgesics. Block times for TAPA were significantly longer than those for m-TAPA. However, both block applications were completed in a short period, smoothly and safely. The analgesic effect of TAPA block was more distinctive at 1 and 12 hours, and NRS scores were lower. However, we think that both block methods, when used under ultrasound guidance, will provide effective analgesia by supplementing the multimodal analgesia planned for laparoscopic cholecystectomy and other abdominal operations.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16361,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Frail elderly patients have an increased risk of delirium after elective surgery; however, such an association remains underexplored among trauma patients. AIM: Our goal was to investigate whether preoperative frailty is associated with postoperative delirium (POD) in elderly orthopedic trauma patients. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, retrospective, cross-sectional study. All patients were ≥ 65 years of age and were admitted to the hospital between 01/01/2017 and 08/31/2018 for surgical intervention of a significant extremity fracture. Frailty was assessed using the fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illness, and loss of weight questionnaire. Delirium was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method. POD was defined as new-onset delirium that occurred within 24 h after surgery. To investigate whether frailty is associated with POD, we performed a multiple variable logistic regression, controlling for biologically relevant confounders. RESULTS: Five hundred fifty-six patients comprised the analytic cohort. Incidence of POD was 14% (n = 80). Multiple variable regression analysis demonstrated that each unit increment in FRAIL score was associated with a 33% higher likelihood of POD (OR 1.33; 95% CI 1.02-1.72, p = 0.03).

A.",Acute peri-operative neurocognitive disorders: a narrative review,"Peri-operative neurocognitive disorders are the most common complication experienced by older individuals undergoing anaesthesia and surgery. Peri-operative neurocognitive disorders, particularly postoperative delirium, result in long-term poor outcomes including: death; dementia; loss of independence; and poor cognitive and functional outcomes. Recent changes to the nomenclature of these disorders aims to align peri-operative neurocognitive disorders with cognitive disorders in the community, with consistent definitions and clinical diagnosis. Possible mechanisms include: undiagnosed neurodegenerative disease; inflammation and resulting neuroinflammation; neuronal damage; and comorbid systemic disease. Pre-operative frailty represents a significant risk for poor postoperative outcomes; it is associated with an increase in the incidence of cognitive decline at 3 and 12 months postoperatively. In addition to cognitive decline, frailty is associated with poor functional outcomes following elective non-cardiac surgery. It was recently shown that 29% of frail patients died or experienced institutionalisation or new disability within 90 days of major elective surgery. Identification of vulnerable patients before undergoing surgery and anaesthesia is the key to preventing peri-operative neurocognitive disorders. Current approaches include: pre-operative delirium and cognitive screening; blood biomarker analysis; intra-operative management that may reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium such as lighter anaesthesia using processed electroencephalography devices; and introduction of guidelines which may reduce or prevent delirium and postoperative neurocognitive disorders. This review will address these issues and advocate for an approach to care for older peri-operative patients which starts in the community and continues throughout the pre-operative, intra-operative, postoperative and post-discharge phases of care management, involving multidisciplinary medical teams, as well as family and caregivers wherever possible.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 6741,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Surgical management usually requires balancing prompt fixation for early mobilization with the need to consider the least physiologically demanding option [3].The aim of this study was to assess predictors of clinical and radiological outcome in patients with PDFFTKA treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of patients managed for PDFFTKA over the last 21 years in the Trauma &amp; Orthopaedics Department of the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital (RSH) was carried out. Radiological images, pre- and post-operatively, were assessed for fracture related parameters. Last known functional status was evaluated using the most recent outpatient review letters. After assessment of normality of data, evaluation of predictors of clinical and radiological outcome was made using correlation analyses. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant correlation between age, primary TKA to fracture interval, and length of intact medial cortex vs clinical outcome for the parametric variables evaluated. For non-parametric variables assessed, there was a statistically significant correlation between clinical outcome and evidence of callus formation (Spearman rho value -0.476; p=0.022). In stratifying the patients with poor and good outcome, there was no difference noted in primary TKA to fracture interval, or length of intact medial cortex (mm) between both groups. In terms of the number of comminuted fragments and anterior flange to fracture distance (mm), there was also no difference noted between the poor and good functional groups. CONCLUSIONS: 1. There was no observed correlation in pre-operative patient and fracture related variables with outcome in this population of patients with PDFFTKA. 2. Post-operative evidence of callus formation appears to be directly related to better clinical outcomes.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16899,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Depression is also correlated with postoperative delirium (POD) after major surgery. However, the association between preoperative depression and POD after cardiac surgery is sparsely studied. The aim of this study was to investigate depression as a predictor for POD in cardiac surgery patients. METHODS: This population-based cohort study included 1133 cardiac surgery patients in Stockholm 2013-2016. Depression was defined by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and POD was evaluated by assessing medical records for symptoms of POD according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria. The association between depression and POD was determined through multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 162 (14%) individuals reported depressive symptoms preoperatively. The incidence of POD was 26% and highest among elderly patients. Among patients with depression, 34% developed POD. In the group of non-depressed patients, 24% developed POD. The overall adjusted odds of delirium were 2.19 times higher in individuals with depressive symptoms compared to controls (95% confidence interval 1.43-3.34). The onset of delirium was most common on Days 0-2 after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: This unique population-based study in patients undergoing cardiac surgery shows that preoperative depression is associated with POD in a large proportion of treated patients. The findings support the need for improved preoperative screening for depression, especially in younger patients, and enhanced clinical surveillance in the early postoperative period for all patients.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16889,Search update 2023-11-13,,

A total of 160 patients who were undergoing gastric cancer surgery from March 2019 to March 2021 were collected as the research objects, and the convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm was used to segment the gastroscope image of gastric cancer. The patients were randomly divided into a simple general anesthesia group of 80 cases and a transversus abdominis plane block combined with rectus abdominis sheath block combined with the general anesthesia group of 80 cases. Then, compare the systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate (HR) at the four time points T(0), T(1), T(2), and T(3). The times of analgesic drug use within 48 hours after operation and postoperative adverse reactions were recorded. The visual analog scale (VAS) scores were also recorded at 4 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h. The results show that the image quality after segmentation is good: the accuracy of tumor location is 75.67%, which is similar to that of professional endoscopists. Compared with the general anesthesia group, the transversus abdominis plane block combined with the rectus sheath block combined with the general anesthesia group had fewer anesthetics, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Compared with the general anesthesia group, SBP, DBP, and HR were significantly reduced at T(1), T(2), and T(3) in the transverse abdominis plane block combined with rectus sheath block and general anesthesia group (P < 0.05). Compared with the simple general anesthesia group, the VAS scores of the transversus abdominis plane block combined with rectus sheath block combined with the general anesthesia group decreased at 4 h, 12 h, and 24 h after surgery, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The number of analgesics used in transversus abdominis plane block combined with the rectus sheath block combined with the general anesthesia group within 48 hours after operation was significantly less than that in the general anesthesia group, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The average incidence of adverse reactions in the nerve block combined with the general anesthesia group was 2.5%, which was lower than the average incidence of 3.75% in the general anesthesia group. In summary, the CNN algorithm can accurately segment the lesions in the ultrasonic images of gastric cancer, which was convenient for doctors to make a more accurate judgment on the lesions, and provided a basis for the preoperative examination of radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Ultrasonic-guided nerve block combined with general anesthesia can effectively improve the analgesic effect of radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer, reduced intraoperative and postoperative adverse reactions and analgesic drug dosage, and had a good effect on postoperative recovery of patients. The combined application of these two methods can further improve the precision treatment of gastric cancer patients and accelerate postoperative recovery.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 9077,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Our aim was to identify a correlation between the atropinic burden (AB) due to drugs with clinical antimuscarinic effect and the occurrence of postoperative delirium. METHODS: We carried out a prospective, monocentric, observational study including 67 patients over 65 years of age who underwent hip fracture surgery. The addition of the anticholinergic weight of each drug was calculated at different time points to distinguish the prehospital, intra- and postoperative part of the AB. A multivariate analysis was carried out to identify the explanatory variables associated with postoperative delirium. RESULTS: Patients were 78 [71-86] years old. The time from admission to surgery was 12 [12-24] hours. The ADL and CIRS scores were 6 [5.5-6] and 6 [4-9], respectively. The total (prehospital plus intraoperative plus postoperative) AB was 5 [3-9]. The incidence of postoperative delirium was 54% (36/67). The demographic characteristics were comparable between delirium and no delirium groups. Univariate analysis showed statistically significant differences between no delirium and delirium groups concerning the number of prehospital atropinic drugs, prehospital AB, the number of postoperative atropinic drugs, postoperative AB, in-hospital AB and the MMSE calculated on postoperative day 5. Using multivariate analysis, postoperative AB, but not pre- and in-hospital ABs, was associated with postoperative delirium with an odds ratio of 1.84 (95% CI: 1.25-2.72; p = 0.002). A postoperative AB > 2 was associated with a postoperative delirium with an area under ROC curve of 0.73 (95% CI: 0.61-0.83; p = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Contrary to a prior exposure to atropinic drugs, a postoperative atropinic burden >2 was associated with postoperative delirium in elderly patients with hip fracture.

A.",The association between preoperative Mini-Cog© score and postoperative delirium (POD): a retrospective cohort study,"Background: The onset of delirium after major surgery is associated with worse in-hospital outcomes for major surgical patients. Best practice recommends assessing surgical patients for delirium risk factors and this includes screening for cognitive impairment. The Mini-Cog© is a short instrument which has been shown to predict postoperative delirium (POD) and other complications in elderly patients undergoing major elective surgery. The primary aim of this study was to ascertain whether a positive preoperative Mini-Cog© is associated with postoperative delirium in elective colorectal surgery patients at high-risk of mortality due to age or comorbidity. Secondary outcomes were 90-day mortality and length of stay. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of data gathered prospectively between October 2015 and December 2017. Baseline data were collected at a preoperative screening clinic, and postoperative data during daily ward rounds by the Perioperative Medicine team at The York Hospital. Results: Three hundred nineteen patients were included in the final analysis, of which 52 (16%) were found to be cognitively impaired on the Mini-Cog©. Older patients (median difference 10 years, p < 0.001) and patients with cognitive impairment (OR 3.04, 95%CI 1.15 to 8.03, p = 0.019) were more likely to develop postoperative delirium in univariate analysis; however, cognitive impairment (OR 0.492, 95%CI 0.177 to 1.368, p = 0.174) loses its significance when controlled for by confounding factors in a logistic regression model. Cognitive impairment (OR 4.65, 95%CI 1.36 to 15.9, p = 0.02), frailty (OR 7.28, 95%CI 1.92 to 27.58, p = 0.009), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade (OR 5.95, 95%CI 1.54 to 22.94, p = 0.006) and age (median difference 10 years, p = 0.002) were significantly associated with 90-day mortality in univariate analysis. Sex was the only factor significantly associated with length of stay in the multiple regression model, with males having a 3-day longer average length of stay than females (OR = 2.94, 95%CI 0.10–5.78). Conclusions: Mini-Cog© is not independently associated with post-operative delirium in high-risk elective colorectal surgery patients in this cohort.

Yet, its role in postoperative neurocognition in the aging brain remains uncertain. We used presurgical thalamic volume as a functional indicator and determined its association with postoperative delirium (POD). METHODS: For this study, 301 older adults (aged ≥65) without dementia and scheduled for surgery were enrolled. Before surgery, participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Thalamus volume was segmented using Freesurfer (Version 5.3.). Participants were screened for POD twice a day until discharge or for a maximum of 7 days. POD was defined as a positive screening on ≥1 of 4 validated instruments: Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS), Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (Nu-DESC), Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), and Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) score. A logistic regression associated thalamus volume with POD with adjustment for age, global brain atrophy, and physical status according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification. RESULTS: In this cohort, 44 participants (14.6%) were diagnosed with POD. Independently of age, global brain atrophy, and physical status score, a higher preoperative thalamus volume was associated with a reduced odds of POD (odds ratio per 1-cm3 increment; 0.73 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.58-0.92]; P = .008). CONCLUSIONS: A larger thalamus volume was associated with reduced odds of POD. Thus, the thalamus marks a region of interest in POD in the aging brain.

The modified National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (mNIHSS) is validated for use in nonsurgical strokes but is not well-studied in surgical patients. We evaluated perioperative changes in the mNIHSS score in noncardiac, non-neurological surgery patients, feasibility in the perioperative setting, and the relationship between baseline cognitive screening and change in mNIHSS score. METHODS: Patients aged 65 years and above presenting for noncardiac, non-neurological surgery were prospectively recruited. Those with significant preoperative cognitive impairment (Montreal Cognitive Assessment score [MoCA] ≤17) were excluded. mNIHSS was assessed preoperatively, on postoperative day (POD) 0, POD 1, and POD 2, demographic data collected, and feedback solicited from participants. Changes in mNIHSS from baseline, time to completion, and relationship between baseline MoCA score and change in mNIHSS score were analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were enrolled into the study; no overt strokes occurred. Median mNIHSS score increased between baseline (0 interquartile range [IQR 0 to 1]) and POD 0 (2 [IQR 0 to 3.5]; P<0.001) but not between baseline and POD 1 (0.5 [IQR 0 to 1.5]; P=0.174) or POD 2 (0 [IQR 0 to 1]; P=0.650). Time to complete the mNIHSS at baseline was 3.5 minutes (SD 0.8), increasing to 4.1 minutes (SD 1.0) on POD 0 (P=0.0249). Baseline MoCA score was correlated with mNIHSS score change (P=0.038). Perioperative administration of the mNIHSS was feasible, and acceptable to patients. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in mNIHSS score can occur early after surgery in the absence of overt stroke.

Influence of Vancouver stage in a retrospective single-centre study of 88 patients,"BACKGROUND: Peri-prosthetic hip fractures (PPHFs) are serious complications whose treatment is generally difficult due to their predominance in elderly patients with bone frailty and other comorbidities. The Vancouver classification is the most widely used and is helpful for assisting treatment decisions. However, its value for predicting morbidity and mortality has not been assessed. The objective of this retrospective study was to assess post-operative morbidity and mortality according to the fracture type in the Vancouver classification. HYPOTHESIS: Post-operative morbidity and mortality vary across fracture types in the Vancouver classification. METHODS: A single-centre retrospective study was conducted from 1st January 2010 to 31st December 2015. All patients who had surgery for a PPHF were included. There were 88 patients, including 66 (75%) females, and mean age was 82 years. The patients were re-evaluated at least 3 years after surgery. The distribution of the fracture types was as follows: Vancouver (V) A, n=7; VB, n=63 (VB1, n=30; VB2, n=23; and VB3, n=10); and VC, n=18. Data on the pre-operative status (self-sufficiency, comorbidities, ASA score, etc.) were extracted from the admission files. Morbidity and mortality were evaluated globally and according to the Vancouver type, using the patient files and telephone calls to determine self-sufficiency scores (Parker, Katz, and Lawton) and functional scores (Merle d'Aubigné-Postel [MAP] score and Harris Hip Score [HHS]). RESULTS: Post-operative medical complications were very common (33 [37.5%] patients) and correlated with the severity of the fracture. Similarly, the mortality rate at last follow-up varied significantly (p<0.05) with the severity of the fracture, as follows: VA, 28.5%; VB1, 40%; VB2, 47.8%; VC, 55.6%; and VB3, 66.7%). In the overall population, loss of self-sufficiency was 20%, 14%, and 26% according to Parker, Katz, and Lawton, respectively; loss of function was 13.9% and 13.3% according to the MAP score and HHS (p<0.05). All the self-sufficiency scores (Parker, Katz, and Lawton) and functional scores (MAP and HHS) decreased post-operatively in proportion to the severity of the fracture (very small losses for VA and greatest losses for VB3) (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The short- and medium-term mortality rates in our cohort of patients with PPHFs were high and chiefly dependent on the severity of the fractures. The self-sufficiency and functional scores were better in the group with VA fractures than in the groups with VB1, VB2, VB3, and VC fractures. In any case, early weight-bearing is without doubt a key factor in limiting the impact of PPHFs on the functional outcome and on mortality.

In this optic, Machine Learning has the capability of deriving data-driven predictions based on multivariate interactions of thousands of instances. Our aim was to cross-validate and test interpretable models for the prediction of post-operative mortality after any surgery in an emergency setting on elderly patients. METHODS: This study is a secondary analysis derived from the FRAILESEL study, a multi-center (N = 29 emergency care units), nationwide, observational prospective study with data collected between 06-2017 and 06-2018 investigating perioperative outcomes of elderly patients (age≥65 years) undergoing emergency surgery. Demographic and clinical data, medical and surgical history, preoperative risk factors, frailty, biochemical blood examination, vital parameters, and operative details were collected and the primary outcome was set to the 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Of the 2570 included patients (50.66% males, median age 77 [IQR = 13] years) 238 (9.26%) were in the non-survivors group. The best performing solution (MultiLayer Perceptron) resulted in a test accuracy of 94.9% (sensitivity = 92.0%, specificity = 95.2%). Model explanations showed how non-chronic cardiac-related comorbidities reduced activities of daily living, low consciousness levels, high creatinine and low saturation increase the risk of death following surgery. CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective observational study, a robustly cross-validated model resulted in better predictive performance than existing tools and scores in literature.

Furthermore, the appropriate preoperative evaluation for hepatectomy in elderly patients is not yet clearly defined. Here, we investigated the applicability of preoperative assessment using the Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) score to help improve hepatectomy outcomes in elderly patients with HCC. This was a single-center retrospective analysis, and the study population comprised 64 consecutive patients who underwent hepatectomy for HCC between January 2012 and August 2016. We compared the preoperative assessment and perioperative outcomes between elderly (≥ 75 years old) and younger (< 75 years old) patients. A total of 61 patients were reviewed. Poor preoperative CONUT score was associated with a longer postoperative hospital stay in elderly patients undergoing hepatectomy for HCC. In addition, although elderly patients had similar perioperative outcomes to younger patients, the incidence of delirium was significantly higher, and univariate analysis confirmed that old age is a risk factor for delirium among the preoperative factors. Hepatectomy for HCC in the elderly can be safely performed with appropriate preoperative nutritional assessment using CONUT score and prevention of postoperative delirium.

Therefore, it is important to manage delirium during the entire perioperative period. Preoperative anxiety is associated with poor prognosis in postoperative patients who have undergone cardiovascular surgery. This study aims to investigate the relationship between preoperative anxiety and onset of delirium after cardiovascular surgery in elderly patients (aged 65 years or older), considering the individual psychological characteristics, such as personality and stress coping skills in response to anxiety, as confounding factors. METHODS: This prospective study included patients aged >65 years in a preoperative state before undergoing cardiovascular surgery.

We compared clinical and demographic factors, preoperative psychiatric and psychological factors, and intraoperative and perioperative physical factors between the control and delirium groups. Multiple imputations were used to account for missing data. RESULTS: Out of 168 subjects enrolled in this study, 26 (15.5%) developed postoperative delirium. Univariate analysis showed significant differences in age (P = 0.027), cognitive function (P = 0.007), agreeableness (P = 0.029), and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-II (APACHE-II) score (P = 0.023) between the delirium and control groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis did not identify a significant association between preoperative anxiety and the onset of postoperative delirium. However, age (odds ratio (OR) = 1.114, P = 0.018), agreeableness (OR = 0.555, P = 0.008), and the APACHE-II score (OR = 1.227, P = 0.008) were identified as risk factors for postoperative delirium. CONCLUSION: Agreeableness, one of the personality traits associated with preoperative anxiety, appears to be involved in the development of postoperative delirium as an independent psychological factor, regardless of age or physical factors.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 11346,Search update 2023-11-13,,

The purpose of this study is to determine (1) whether patients undergoing two-stage revision total hip and knee arthroplasty for prosthetic joint infection were more likely to get Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Depression scores consistent with major depressive disorder (MDD) than those undergoing aseptic revision and (2) whether these symptoms resolved after the procedure. Methods: Records of all 366 patients that underwent revision total hip or knee arthroplasty from January 1, 2015, – June 20, 2019, were reviewed. Forty-two patients were excluded for missing PROMIS Depression scores or incomplete treatment. Preoperative (<3 months), early postoperative (2-8 weeks), and final postoperative (6-18 months) Depression scores were collected. Patients crossing the PROMIS Depression threshold equivalent to a Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score ≥10, indicative of MDD, were evaluated. Results: More two-stage revision patients developed Depression scores indicative of MDD perioperatively than the aseptic cohort (20.0% vs 6.5%, P = .01). Two-stage revision patients had higher (worse) median Depression scores preoperatively (54.8 vs 51.3, P = .04) and at early follow-up (54.3 vs 49.9, P = .01), but not at final follow-up (50.4 vs 49.1, P = .39). Across all patients, Depression scores improved by 2.4 points at early follow-up (95% confidence interval:1.1–3.7; P < .001) and 3 points at final follow-up (95% confidence interval:1.5-4.5; P < .001; minimal clinically important difference 3.0). Conclusions: Twenty percent of two-stage revision arthroplasty patients, compared to <7% of aseptic revision patients, developed PROMIS Depression scores consistent with MDD during treatment.

E., Thoma, A.",Assessing patient frailty in plastic surgery: A systematic review,"PURPOSE: With the increase in the aging population, the level of frailty has become an important metric for assessing preoperative patient risk. Although medical and surgical specialties continue to adopt and standardize the use of frailty instruments, few studies within the plastic surgery literature have utilized such instruments to predict poor postoperative outcomes. The purpose of this article is two-fold: (1) to provide a comprehensive review of the existing frailty instruments and (2) to summarise the existing evidence regarding the role of pre-operative frailty assessments on peri‑operative morbidity and mortality in plastic surgery. METHODS: This systematic review was registered a priori on the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/vfzw8). A computerized database search of Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane was performed from database inception to December 13, 2020. All articles that examined the effect of preoperative patient frailty on perioperative morbidity and mortality outcomes following plastic surgery interventions were included for data extraction. RESULTS: From the 11 studies included in this review, ten unique frailty instruments were identified. The modified Frailty Index (mFI) and the Fried Frailty Index (FFI) were the most commonly reported frailty measurement tools; however, the FRAIL scale was the only outcome measure identified to be valid, reliable, and responsive to change. Regardless of the frailty measure used, nearly all studies reported that worse surgical outcomes were associated with a higher patient frailty score. CONCLUSION: There is a strong association between higher frailty scores and worse postoperative outcomes in plastic surgery. The FRAIL scale is a clinimetrically sound frailty instrument that should be used in all patients to assess perioperative risk in plastic surgery.",duplicate of 6977,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Postoperative delirium is one of the most common complications after hip fracture, but no study has assessed the impact of therapeutics received during a dedicated orthogeriatric care pathway on its incidence. Our main objective was to assess the association between drugs used in emergency, operating, and recovery departments and postoperative delirium during the acute stay. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: All patients ≥70 years old admitted for hip fracture to the emergency department and hospitalized in our unit for perioperative geriatric care after hip fracture surgery under general anesthesia between July 2009 and December 2019 in an academic hospital in Paris. METHODS: Demographic, clinical, and biological data and all medications administered pre-, peri-, and postoperatively were prospectively collected by 3 geriatricians. Postoperative delirium in the unit for perioperative geriatric care was assessed by using the confusion assessment method scale. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess variables independently associated with postoperative delirium. RESULTS: A total of 490 patients were included [mean (SD) age 87 (6) years]; 215 (44%) had postoperative delirium. The occurrence was not associated with therapeutics administered during the dedicated orthogeriatric care pathway. Probability of postoperative delirium was associated with advanced age [>90 years, odds ratio (OR) 2.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-3.89], dementia (OR 3.51, 95% CI 2.14--5.82), depression (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.14-3.01), and preoperative use of beta-blockers (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.10-2.79). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: No emergency or anesthetic drugs were significantly associated with postoperative delirium. Further studies are needed to demonstrate a possible causal link between preoperative use of beta-blockers and postoperative delirium.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 9086,Search update 2023-11-13,,

SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The study included patients aged 70 or older, who were treated for a gastrointestinal cancer at the Oncological Surgery Division of the Policlinico San Martino Hospital (Genoa, Italy). Patients from the control group were treated between January 2015 and October 2018, and the patients who received geriatric comanagement during their stay in the surgical ward were treated between November 2018 and December 2019. METHODS: Patients from both groups received a preoperative comprehensive geriatric assessment in the preoperative phase and were followed according to the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery model in the perioperative period. In the geriatric comanagement group, targeted interventions during daily geriatrician-led ward rounds were performed. Inverse probability weighting was used to adjust estimates for potential baseline confounders.

W.",Risk factors for delirium in elderly patients after lumbar spinal fusion,"OBJECTIVE: To identify perioperative risk factors for postoperative delirium (POD) in patients aged 65 or older undergoing lumbar spinal fusion procedures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis was performed on patients undergoing lumbar spinal fusion over an approximately three-year period at a single institution. Demographic and perioperative data were obtained from electronic medical records. The primary outcome was the presence of postoperative delirium assayed by the Delirium Observation Screening Scale (DOSS) and Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed on the data. RESULTS: Of the 702 patients included in the study, 173 (24.6%) developed POD. Our analysis revealed that older age (p < 0.001), lower preoperative hemoglobin (p < 0.001), and higher ASA status (p < 0.001), were significant preoperative risk factors for developing POD. The only significant intraoperative risk factor was a higher number of spinal levels that were instrumented (p < 0.001). Higher pain scores on postoperative day 1 (p < 0.001), and lower postoperative hemoglobin (p < 0.001) were associated with increased POD; as were ICU admission (p < 0.001) and increased length of ICU stay (p < 0.001). Patients who developed POD had a longer hospital stay (p < 0.001) with lower rates of discharge to home as opposed to an inpatient facility (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Risk factors for POD in older adults undergoing lumbar spinal fusion surgery include advanced age, diabetes, lower preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin, higher ASA grade, greater extent of surgery, and higher postoperative pain scores. Patients with delirium had a higher incidence of postoperative ICU admission, increased length of stay, decreased likelihood of discharge to home and increased mortality, all consistent with prior studies. Further studies may determine whether adequate management of anemia and pain lead to a reduction in the incidence of postoperative delirium in these patients.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16370,Search update 2023-11-13,,

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional database analysis. SETTING: American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database. METHODS: The 2005 to 2017 ACS-NSQIP was queried for patients undergoing complex HNS. Five-item modified frailty index (mFI) was calculated based on functional status and history of diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, and chronic hypertension. RESULTS: A total of 2786 patients (73.1% male) with a mean age of 62.0 ± 11.6 years were included. Compared to nonfrail patients (41.2%), patients with mFI ≥1 (58.8%) had shorter length of operation (P = .021), longer length of stay (LOS) (P < .001), and higher rates of 30-day reoperation (P = .009), medical complications (P < .001), discharge to nonhome facility (DNHF) (P < .001), and mortality (P = .047). These parameters remained statistically significant when compared across all individual mFI scores (all P < .05). After adjusting for age, sex, race, body mass index, smoking, and American Society of Anesthesiologists score via multivariate logistic regression, patients with mFI ≥1 were significantly more likely to undergo reoperation (odds ratio [OR], 1.39), surgical complications (OR, 1.19), medical complications (OR, 1.55), prolonged LOS (OR, 1.29), and DNHF (OR, 1.56) (all P < .05). Multivariate logistic regression also demonstrated that after adjusting for confounders, compared to patients with mFI = 1, patients with mFI = 2-5 (18.7%) were more likely to undergo shorter operations (OR, 0.74), have medical (OR, 1.46) or any complications (OR, 1.27), and have DNHF (OR, 1.62) (all P < .05). CONCLUSION: The 5-point mFI can independently predict short-term surgical outcomes following complex HNS. This simple and reliable metric can potentially lead to improved preoperative counseling and postoperative planning for complex HNS patients.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 7563,Search update 2023-11-13,,

I.",Frailty and emergency surgery: identification and evidence-based care for vulnerable older adults,"Frailty is a multidimensional state related to accumulation of age- and disease-related deficits across multiple domains. Older people represent the fastest growing segment of the peri-operative population, and 25-50% of older surgical patients live with frailty. When frailty is present before surgery, adjusted rates of morbidity and mortality increase at least two-fold; the odds of delirium and loss of independence are increased more than four- and five-fold, respectively. Care of the older person with frailty presenting for emergency surgery requires individualised and evidence-based care given the high-risk and complex nature of their presentations. Before surgery, frailty should be assessed using a multidimensional frailty instrument (most likely the Clinical Frailty Scale), and all members of the peri-operative team should be aware of each patient's frailty status. When frailty is present, pre-operative care should focus on documenting and communicating individualised risk, considering advanced care directives and engaging shared decision-making when feasible. Shared multidisciplinary care should be initiated. Peri-operatively, analgesia that avoids polypharmacy should be provided, along with delirium prevention strategies and consideration of postoperative care in a monitored environment. After the acute surgical episode, transition out of hospital requires that adequate support be in place, along with clear discharge instructions, and review of new and existing prescription medications. Advanced care directives should be reviewed or initiated in case of readmission. Overall, substantial knowledge gaps about the optimal peri-operative care of older people with frailty must be addressed through robust, patient-oriented research.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16720,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Routine preoperative frailty assessment is underperformed. Automation of preoperative frailty assessment using electronic health data could improve adherence to guideline-based care if an accurate instrument is identified. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adults >65 yr undergoing elective noncardiac surgery between 2012 and 2018. Four frailty instruments were compared: Frailty Index, Hospital Frailty Risk Score, Risk Analysis Index-Administrative, and Adjusted Clinical Groups frailty-defining diagnoses indicator. We compared the predictive performance of each instrument added to a baseline model (age, sex, ASA physical status, and procedural risk) using discrimination, calibration, explained variance, net reclassification, and Brier score (binary outcomes); and explained variance, root mean squared error, and mean absolute prediction error (continuous outcomes). Primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included 365-day mortality, length of stay, non-home discharge, days alive at home, and 365-day costs. RESULTS: For this study, 171 576 patients met the inclusion criteria; 1370 (0.8%) died within 30 days. Compared with the baseline model predicting 30-day mortality (area under the curve [AUC] 0.85; R(2) 0.08), the addition of Hospital Frailty Risk Score led to the greatest improvement in discrimination (AUC 0.87), explained variance (R(2) 0.09), and net reclassification (Net Reclassification Index 0.65). Brier and calibration scores were comparable. CONCLUSIONS: All four frailty instruments significantly improved discrimination and risk reclassification when added to typically assessed preoperative risk factors. Accurate identification of the presence or absence of preoperative frailty using electronic frailty instruments may improve perioperative risk stratification.

K.",Changes in Anesthesia Can Reduce Periprocedural Urinary Retention After EVAR,"BACKGROUND: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) programs provide a streamlined approach for expedient postoperative care of high-volume procedures. Endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) has become standard treatment for abdominal aortic aneurysms and implementation of an early recovery program is warranted. Postoperative urinary retention (POUR) remains a problem lending to longer hospital stays and patient discomfort. We aim to demonstrate the utility of monitored anesthetic care (MAC) plus local anesthesia as a modality to minimize urinary retention following EVAR. METHODS: Single-center retrospective review from January 2017 to March 2020 of all patients undergoing standard elective EVAR under general anesthesia or MAC anesthesia. Local anesthetic at vessel access sites was used in all patients under MAC. Ruptured pathology and female sex were excluded from analysis. Patient characteristics, operative details, prostate measurements, and outcomes were abstracted from the electronic medical record. Urinary retention was defined as any requirement of straight catheterization, urinary catheter replacement, or discharge with urinary catheter. Chi square tests and logistic regression were used to determine predictors associated with POUR and increased hospital length of stay. RESULTS: Among 138 patients who underwent EVAR, eight (5.8%) were excluded due to ruptured pathology. Of the cohort, 113 (86.9%) were male with mean age of 73 years. Excluding female patients, 63 (55.8%) male patients underwent general anesthesia and 50 (44.3%) underwent MAC. Male patients under general anesthesia were more likely to have intra-operative urinary catheter placement when compared to MAC (82.5% vs. 36%, respectively; P < 0.001). POUR was identified in 17 patients (13.1%) of the entire study population with 15 events (88.2%) occurring in males. Excluding patients who were admitted to the ICU, twenty-two (19.5%) male patients stayed past postoperative day (POD) one, of which those who developed POUR were more likely to experience compared to those without POUR (45.6% vs. 9.7%, respectively; P = 0.001). On multivariable analysis, male patients who received MAC had a lower risk of developing POUR (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.02–0.50). POUR was not associated with elective urinary catheter placement nor with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, urinary retention, benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), or use of BPH medications. Additionally, neither prostate size nor volume was associated with developing POUR among male patients. CONCLUSION: MAC plus local anesthesia is associated with decreased rates of POUR after elective EVAR in male patients. ERAS pathways during elective EVAR interventions should implement MAC plus local anesthesia as an acceptable anesthetic option, where appropriate, in order to reduce urinary retention rates and subsequently decrease hospital length of stay in this patient cohort.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 9362,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Several risk adjustment models based on coded comorbidities such as Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), modified Elixhauser's Comorbidity Measure (mECM), and modified frailty index (mFI-5) are currently prevalent for orthopedic patients, but there is no consensus regarding which is optimal. The primary purpose was to identify the risk factors of CCI, mECM, and mFI-5, as well as patient characteristics for predicting (1) 1-month, 3-month, 1-year, and 2-year mortality, (2) perioperative complications, and (3) extended length of stay (LOS) following hip fractured surgery. The secondary aim was to compare the best-performing comorbidity index combined with characteristics identified in terms of their discriminative ability for adverse outcomes. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 3,379 consecutive patients presenting with intertrochanteric fractures at our Level I trauma center from 2013 to 2018. After eliminated by exclusion criteria, 2,241 patients undergoing hip fracture surgery by PFNA, with age ≥65 years, were included. Three main multivariate logistic regression models were constructed. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios for mortality. A base model included age, BMI, surgical delay, anesthesia type, hemoglobin record at admission, and American Society of Anesthesiologists grade (ASA) also was constructed and assessed. RESULTS: Base model + mECM outperformed other models for the occurrence of major complications including severe complications, cardiac complications, and pulmonary complications [the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), 0.647; 95% CI, 0.616-0.677; AUC, 0.637; 95% CI, 0.610-0.664; AUC, 0.679; 95% CI, 0.642-0.715, respectively], while base model + CCI provided better prediction of minor complications of neurological complications and hematological complications (AUC, 0.659; 95% CI, 0.609, 0.709; AUC, 0.658; 95% CI, 0.635, 0.680). In addition, BMI, surgical delay, anesthesia type, and ASA were found highly relevant to extended LOS. Age-group (with a 10-year interval) was indicated to be mostly associated with all-cause mortality with fully adjusted hazard ratio of 1.35 and 95% CI range 1.20-1.51. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with mFI-5 and CCI, mECM so far may be the best comorbidity index combined with the base model for predicting major complications following hip fracture. The base model already achieved good discrimination for all-cause mortality and extended LOS, further addition of risk adjustment indices led to only 1% increase in the amount of variation explained.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 9412,Search update 2023-11-13,,

However, few studies have focused on the sedative effect of RT during gastrointestinal endoscopy in elderly patients. The purpose of this study is to compare the sedative effect of RT and propofol for gastrointestinal endoscopy in elderly patients. Methods: A total of 82 patients aged ≥65 years with an American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) grade I-II and a body mass index (BMI) of 18.0 to 30.0 kg/m2 who were scheduled for gastrointestinal endoscopy from Jan 2021 to Aug 2021 were selected and randomly divided into a RT group and a propofol group. Alfentanil 5 μg/kg was used for analgesia in both groups. The RT group was given remimazolam tosilate 0.15 mg/kg with supplemental doses of 0.05 mg/kg as need, while the propofol group was given propofol 1.5 mg/kg with supplemental doses of 0.5 mg/kg. The supplemental doses were determined by the modified observational alertness/sedation assessment (MOAA/S) score and the patients’ body movements. Sedative effects, such as the time to loss of consciousness (LOC) (MOAA/S score ≤ 1), successful sedation in one dose, number of supplemental doses after successful induction, and recovery time, were evaluated. Sedation-related side effects, such as injection pain, haemodynamic events and respiratory depression, were also noted. Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), visual analogue scale (VAS) scores at rest, remedial analgesics, and dizziness or headache were recorded. In addition, patients’ satisfaction and physician’s satisfaction of the procedure were compared between the two groups. Results: Data from 77 patients were analysed. The success rate of sedation in both groups was 100%. The time to LOC (MOAA/S score ≤ 1) in the RT group was longer than that in the propofol group (20.7 ± 6.1s vs. 13.2 ± 5.2s, P < 0.001). There were fewer patients in the RT group reporting injection pain than that in the propofol group (0/39 vs. 5/38, P = 0.025). Haemodynamic events and respiratory depression in the RT group were less frequent than those in the propofol group ((6/39 vs. 17/38, P = 0.005), (2/39 vs. 9/38, P = 0.026), respectively). The number of supplemental doses after successful induction in the RT group was greater than that in the propofol group (4/9/11/13/1/1 vs. 8/4/18/6/2/0 requiring 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 supplemental doses, P = 0.014). The characteristics of the patients enrolled, postoperative parameters of the patients, and patients’ and physician’s satisfaction of the procedure were comparable in the two groups. Conclusions: Compared with propofol, RT can be safely and effectively used for gastrointestinal endoscopy sedation in elderly patients, and the incidence of sedation-related adverse reactions, especially haemodynamic events and respiratory depression, is lower. When RT is used, the number of supplemental doses after successful induction may increase slightly. Trial registration: Chictr.org.cn ChiCTR2000040498.

A retrospective analysis of all surgically treated patients presenting with IF was conducted at a single Level I trauma center in China between Jan. 2016 and Jan. 2020. The data concerning patients' demographics, injury-related data, surgery-related data, operation-related data, in-hospital data, and postoperative outcomes were extracted. To minimize potential confounding and selection bias, the propensity score matching (PSM) method was performed via the caliper matching method by using a 1 : 1 ratio. After PSM, McNemar's chi-square tests were used to examine the association of using IVP with outcome analyses. The Spearman correlations of IVP using, pain scores, and the factors which may influence them were also computed. After screening 2963 consecutive patients, 2166 were included finally, including 1576 in the non-IVP group and 590 in the IVP group. After PSM, 531 remained in each group. The pain scores at discharge were significantly between the two groups before and after matching (all p < 0.001). The differences of delirium rate and functional outcomes became significant after propensity score-based matching (p=0.001 and 0.033, respectively), although they were not significant before matching. No significant difference was observed in other operation-related data, LOS, and crude mortality rates at 30-day, 90-day, and 12-month before and after PSM. In conclusion, this study highlights the need for preoperative IVP use to optimize pain control, postoperative functional recovery, and minimize pain-related comorbidities such as delirium in elderly patients with hip fracture.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 9549,Search update 2023-11-13,,

METHODS: Data of patients aged 18 years and older who were diagnosed with subarachnoid hemorrhage or intracerebral hemorrhage, underwent aneurysm repair surgical intervention from 2005 to 2014. A retrospective database analysis was performed based on U.S. National Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 2005 to 2014. Frailty was determined using the Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups (ACG) frailty-defining diagnoses indicator. Patients were stratified into frail and non-frail groups and the study endpoints were incidence of postoperative complications and related adverse clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Among 20,527 included aSAH patients, 2303 (11.2%) were frail and 18,224 (88.8%) were non-frail. Significant differences were found between frailty and non-frailty groups in the four clinical outcomes (all p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that frailty was associated with significant higher risks of discharge to institutional care (aOR: 2.50, 95%CI: 2.10-2.97), tracheostomy or gastrostomy tube replacement (aOR: 4.41, 95%CI: 3.81-5.10) and postoperative complications (aOR: 3.29, 95%CI: 2.55-4.25) but a lower risk of death in hospital (aOR: 0.40, 95%CI: 0.33-0.49) as compared with non-frailty. Stratified analysis showed the impact of frailty on some of the outcomes were greater among patients younger than 65 years than their older counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is significantly correlated with the increased risk of discharge to institutional care, tracheostomy or gastrostomy tube placement, and postoperative complications but with the reduced risk of in-hospital mortality outcomes after aneurysm repair. Frailty seems to have greater impact among younger adults than older ones. Baseline frailty evaluation could be applied to risk stratification for aSAH patients who were undergoing surgery.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 7355,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Methods: The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database was used to select patients who underwent RARP without other concomitant surgeries between 2008 and 2016. Patients’ demographics, comorbidities, and laboratory markers were collected to evaluate their role in predicting pLOS. The pLOS was defined as length of stay (LOS) >2 days. A multinomial logistic regression was constructed adjusting for postoperative surgical complications to assess for the predictors of pLOS. Results: We obtained data for 31,253 patients of which 20,774 (66.5%) patients stayed ⩽1 day, 6993 (22.4%) patients stayed for 2 days, and 3486 (11.2%) patients stayed for >2 days.

METHODS: A multicentre collaboration among 112 centres in 14 countries collected data on all patients presenting with a hip fracture between 1st March-31st May 2020. Demographics, residence, place of injury, presentation blood tests, Nottingham Hip Fracture Score, time to surgery, management, ASA grade, length of stay, COVID-19 and 30-day mortality status were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 7090 patients were included, with a mean age of 82.2 (range 50-104) years and 4959 (69.9%) being female. Of 651 (9.2%) patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 225 (34.6%) were positive at presentation and 426 (65.4%) were positive postoperatively. Positive COVID-19 status was independently associated with male sex (odds ratio (OR) 1.38, p = 0.001), residential care (OR 2.15, p < 0.001), inpatient fall (OR 2.23, p = 0.003), cancer (OR 0.63, p = 0.009), ASA grades 4 (OR 1.59, p = 0.008) or 5 (OR 8.28, p < 0.001), and longer admission (OR 1.06 for each increasing day, p < 0.001). Patients with COVID-19 at any time had a significantly lower chance of 30-day survival versus those without COVID-19 (72.7% versus 92.6%, p < 0.001). COVID-19 was independently associated with an increased 30-day mortality risk (hazard ratio (HR) 2.83, p < 0.001).

This study examined the association between frailty and remaining alive and at home after cancer surgery among older adults. METHODS: Adults aged ≥70 years undergoing cancer resection were included in this population-based retrospective cohort study using linked administrative datasets in Ontario, Canada. The probability of remaining alive and at home in the 5 years after cancer resection was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Extended Cox regression with time-varying effects examined the association between frailty and remaining alive and at home. RESULTS: Of 82,037 patients, 6,443 (7.9%) had preoperative frailty. With median follow-up of 47 months (interquartile range, 23-81 months), patients with frailty had a significantly lower probability of remaining alive and at home 5 years after cancer surgery compared with those without frailty (39.1% [95% CI, 37.8%-40.4%] vs 62.5% [95% CI, 62.1%-63.9%]). After adjusting for age, sex, rural living, material deprivation, immigration status, cancer type, surgical procedure intensity, year of surgery, and receipt of perioperative therapy, frailty remained associated with increased hazards of not remaining alive and at home. This increase was highest 31 to 90 days after surgery (hazard ratio [HR], 2.00 [95% CI, 1.78-2.24]) and remained significantly elevated beyond 1 year after surgery (HR, 1.56 [95% CI, 1.48-1.64]). This pattern was observed across cancer sites, including those requiring low-intensity surgery (breast and melanoma). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative frailty was independently associated with a decreased probability of remaining alive and at home after cancer surgery among older adults. This relationship persisted over time for all cancer types beyond short-term mortality and the initial postoperative period. Frailty assessment may be useful for all candidates for cancer surgery, and these data can be used when counseling, selecting, and preparing patients for surgery.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16835,Search update 2023-11-13,,

This review aims to evaluate the evidence surrounding prehabilitation in older patients anticipating liver resection and to describe how prehabilitation may be implemented. Design: Problem-based narrative review with case-based discussion. Setting and Participants: All older adults anticipating liver resection inclusive of benign and malignant etiologies in the United States. Methods: Literature search was performed using MeSH terms and keywords in MEDLINE via PubMed, followed by a manual second search for relevant references within selected articles. Articles were excluded if not available in the English language or did not include patients undergoing hepatectomy. Results: Prehabilitation includes a range of activities including exercise, nutrition/dietary changes, and psychosocial interventions that may occur from several weeks to days preceding a surgical operation. Older adult patients who participate in prehabilitation may experience improvement in preoperative candidacy as well as improved postoperative quality of life and faster return to baseline; however, evidence supporting a reduction in postoperative length of stay and perioperative morbidity and mortality is conflicting. A variety of modalities are available for prehabilitation but lack consensus and standardization. For a provider desiring to prescribe prehabilitation, multidisciplinary assessments including geriatric, cardiopulmonary, and future remnant liver function can help determine individual patient needs and select appropriate interventions.

J.",A Tool to Estimate Risk of 30-day Mortality and Complications After Hip Fracture Surgery: Accurate Enough for Some but Not All Purposes? A Study From the ACS-NSQIP Database,"BACKGROUND: Surgical repair of hip fracture carries substantial short-term risks of mortality and complications. The risk-reward calculus for most patients with hip fractures favors surgical repair. However, some patients have low prefracture functioning, frailty, and/or very high risk of postoperative mortality, making the choice between surgical and nonsurgical management more difficult. The importance of high-quality informed consent and shared decision-making for frail patients with hip fracture has recently been demonstrated. A tool to accurately estimate patient-specific risks of surgery could improve these processes. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: With this study, we sought (1) to develop, validate, and estimate the overall accuracy (C-index) of risk prediction models for 30-day mortality and complications after hip fracture surgery; (2) to evaluate the accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, and false discovery rates) of risk prediction thresholds for identifying very high-risk patients; and (3) to implement the models in an accessible web calculator. METHODS: In this comparative study, preoperative demographics, comorbidities, and preoperatively known operative variables were extracted for all 82,168 patients aged 18 years and older undergoing surgery for hip fracture in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) between 2011 and 2017. Eighty-two percent (66,994 of 82,168 ) of patients were at least 70 years old, 21% (17,007 of 82,168 ) were at least 90 years old, 70% (57,260 of 82,168 ) were female, and 79% (65,301 of 82,168 ) were White. A total of 5% (4260 of 82,168) of patients died within 30 days of surgery, and 8% (6786 of 82,168) experienced a major complication. The ACS-NSQIP database was chosen for its clinically abstracted and reliable data from more than 600 hospitals on important surgical outcomes, as well as rich characterization of preoperative demographic and clinical predictors for demographically diverse patients. Using all the preoperative variables in the ACS-NSQIP dataset, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression, a type of machine learning that selects variables to optimize accuracy and parsimony, was used to develop and validate models to predict two primary outcomes: 30-day postoperative mortality and any 30-day major complications. Major complications were defined by the occurrence of ACS-NSQIP complications including: on a ventilator longer than 48 hours, intraoperative or postoperative unplanned intubation, septic shock, deep incisional surgical site infection (SSI), organ/space SSI, wound disruption, sepsis, intraoperative or postoperative myocardial infarction, intraoperative or postoperative cardiac arrest requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation, acute renal failure needing dialysis, pulmonary embolism, stroke/cerebral vascular accident, and return to the operating room. Secondary outcomes were six clusters of complications recently developed and increasingly used for the development of surgical risk models, namely: (1) pulmonary complications, (2) infectious complications, (3) cardiac events, (4) renal complications, (5) venous thromboembolic events, and (6) neurological events. Tenfold cross-validation was used to assess overall model accuracy with C-indexes, a measure of how well models discriminate patients who experience an outcome from those who do not. Using the models, the predicted risk of outcomes for each patient were used to estimate the accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, and false discovery rates) of a wide range of predicted risk thresholds. We then implemented the prediction models into a web-accessible risk calculator. RESULTS: The 30-day mortality and major complication models had good to fair discrimination (C-indexes of 0.76 and 0.64, respectively) and good calibration throughout the range of predicted risk. Thresholds of predicted risk to identify patients at very high risk of 30-day mortality had high specificity but also high false discovery rates. For example, a 30-day mortality predicted risk threshold of 15% resulted in 97% specificity, meaning 97% of patients who lived longer than 30 days were below that risk threshold. However, this threshold had a false discovery rate of 78%, meaning 78% of patients above that threshold survived longer than 30 days and might have benefitted from surgery. The tool is available here: https://s-spire-clintools.shinyapps.io/hip_deploy/ . CONCLUSION: The models of mortality and complications we developed may be accurate enough for some uses, especially personalizing informed consent and shared decision-making with patient-specific risk estimates. However, the high false discovery rate suggests the models should not be used to restrict access to surgery for high-risk patients. Deciding which measures of accuracy to prioritize and what is ""accurate enough"" depends on the clinical question and use of the predictions. Discrimination and calibration are commonly used measures of overall model accuracy but may be poorly suited to certain clinical questions and applications. Clinically, overall accuracy may not be as important as knowing how accurate and useful specific values of predicted risk are for specific purposes.Level of Evidence Level III, therapeutic study.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16976,Search update 2023-11-13,,

W., Thomas, C.",Anticholinergic Drug Exposure Increases the Risk of Delirium in Older Patients Undergoing Elective Surgery,"Introduction: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common and serious adverse event of surgery in older people. Because of its great impact on patients' safety and quality of life, identification of modifiable risk factors could be useful. Although preoperative medication intake is assumed to be an important modifiable risk factor, the impact of anticholinergic drugs on the occurrence of POD seems underestimated in elective surgery. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between preoperative anticholinergic burden and POD. We hypothesized that a high preoperative anticholinergic burden is an independent, potentially modifiable predisposing and precipitating factor of POD in older people. Methods: Between November 2017 and April 2019, 1,470 patients of 70 years and older undergoing elective orthopedic, general, cardiac, or vascular surgery were recruited in the randomized, prospective, multicenter PAWEL trial. Anticholinergic burden of a sub-cohort of 899 patients, who did not receive a multimodal intervention for preventing POD, was assessed by two different tools at hospital admission: The established Anticholinergic Risk Scale (ARS) and the recently developed Anticholinergic Burden Score (ABS). POD was detected by confusion assessment method (CAM) and a validated post discharge medical record review. Logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between anticholinergic burden and POD. Results: POD was observed in 210 of 899 patients (23.4%). Both ARS and ABS were independently associated with POD. The association persisted after adjustment for relevant confounding factors such as age, sex, comorbidities, preoperative cognitive and physical status, number of prescribed drugs, surgery time, type of surgery and anesthesia, usage of heart-lung-machine, and treatment in intensive care unit. If a patient was taking one of the 56 drugs listed in the ABS, risk for POD was 2.7-fold higher (OR = 2.74, 95% CI = 1.55–4.94) and 1.5-fold higher per additional point on the ARS (OR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.15–2.02). Conclusion: Preoperative anticholinergic drug exposure measured by ARS or ABS was independently associated with POD in older patients undergoing elective surgery. Therefore, identification, discontinuation or substitution of anticholinergic medication prior to surgery may be a promising approach to reduce the risk of POD in older patients.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16749,Search update 2023-11-13,,

This single-centre, prospective, randomised study included adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) undergoing surgical chronic subdural haematoma evacuation. Patients were randomly allocated to general (target-controlled total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol and remifentanil) or regional anaesthesia (bilateral scalp block with remifentanil sedation if required). The primary outcome measure was duration of hospital stay, based on the day patients were judged by an investigator blinded from the allocation group to be medically fit for discharge. Secondary outcomes included: rate of regional anaesthesia failure; rate of intra-operative and postoperative adverse events at 24 hours; and pain scores at 24 hours. Data from 60 patients were analysed (30 general anaesthesia and 30 regional anaesthesia). Median (IQR [range]) time until patients were judged medically fit for discharge was 3 (3–3 [2–10]) days and 3 (2–5 [2–15]) days for general and regional anaesthesia, respectively (p = 0.700). Regional anaesthesia failed in two patients. There were more intra-operative adverse events in patients who received general anaesthesia (25 vs. 11, respectively; p = 0.001). The occurrence of postoperative adverse events was similar for general and regional anaesthesia (16 vs. 13 patients, respectively; p = 0.605). In patients requiring chronic subdural haematoma evacuation, general and regional anaesthesia are comparable in terms of duration of time until medically fit for discharge and occurrence of postoperative complications.

We aimed to develop a POD-risk prediction score based on known risk factors and delirium-risk increasing drugs to be used by pharmacists during medication reconciliation at hospital admission, and to test for feasibility in a retrospective cohort of surgical patients. Therefore, established POD-risk factors and drugs were extracted from the literature and a score was generated. Following this, the score was tested for feasibility in a retrospective 3-month-cohort of surgical patients. For patients with higher scores suggesting higher probability of POD, patient charts were screened for documentation of POD. For development of the score, the following POD-risk factors were defined and points assigned for score calculation: age (≥65 years=1 point/≥75 years=2), male sex (1), renal insufficiency (RI; 1), hepatic impairment (HI; Model-of-endstage-liver-disease (MELD) 10-14=1/≥15=2), delirium-risk increasing drugs (1 point per drug class), anticholinergic drug burden (ACB; ≥3=1). In the retrospective test cohort of 1174 surgical patients these factors concerned: age ≥65 years 567 patients (48%)/≥75 years 303 (26%), male 652 (55%), RI 238 (20%), MELD 10-14 106 (9%)/≥15 65 (5%), ≥ 1 delirium-risk increasing drug 418 (36%), ACB ≥3 106 (9%). The median POD-risk prediction score was 2 (range 0-9). Of 146 patients (12%) with a score ≥ 5, POD was documented for 43 (30%), no evidence for POD for 91 (62%) and data inconclusive for 12 (8%). For scores of ≥ 7, POD was documented for 50% of the patients with sufficient POD documentation. Overall, POD documentation was poor.

G., Boes, N., Reuschel, B., Lutz, A., Thigpen, C. A., Shanley, E., Kissenberth, M. J.","Mental health status, not resilience, influences functional recovery after arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs","Background: Recent literature has shown the importance of patient psychosocial status in overcoming stressful events, such as surgery. Resilience, the ability to “bounce back” from adversity, has been recently correlated to outcomes following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (RCR). Overall mental well-being has also been shown to be important because patients with clinical depression and anxiety may have worse outcomes. Substantial clinical benefit (SCB) is the threshold of outcome improvement that a patient perceives as considerable. The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of preoperative resilience, mental health status, and rotator cuff tear size on patient outcome recovery measured by the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score. Methods: Patients undergoing arthroscopic RCR performed from 2016 through 2019 at a single tertiary institution by fellowship-trained sports surgeons with a high-volume shoulder practice were included. The Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) score and Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey (VR-12) Mental Component Score (MCS) were collected preoperatively. ASES scores were obtained preoperatively, as well as 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on the SCB threshold of 87 for the ASES score based on validated, established literature. Rotator cuff tear size was classified as small (≤3 cm) or large (>3 cm). VR-12 MCS, BRS, and ASES scores were compared at baseline, 6 months, and 1 year using separate mixed-model analyses of variance between the tear size and SCB groups. For ASES score comparison, the VR-12 MCS was used as a covariate to account for differences in baseline mental status. Results: RCR was performed in 119 patients, with an average age of 61 years (standard deviation, 10 years). There were 71 male and 48 female patients. At 6 months, 43% of patients met the SCB threshold. The VR-12 MCS was significantly different between RCR patients who met the SCB threshold for the ASES score and those who did not at 6 and 12 months for large rotator cuff tears (P =.001) but not small tears (P =.07). The BRS score was not different between the tear size and SCB groups at any time point (P =.12). Conclusion: Our results show that patients who met the SCB threshold at 6 months postoperatively after arthroscopic RCR demonstrated higher preoperative VR-12 MCS values; however, higher preoperative BRS scores were not seen in those meeting the SCB threshold. In fact, when baseline VR-12 MCS values were accounted for in patients with large rotator cuff tears, the differences in ASES scores normalized. This finding suggests that baseline mental health status, as measured by the VR-12 MCS, significantly influenced patients’ functional recovery following RCR.

E., Yang, B.",Gait speed is a preoperative indicator of postoperative events after elective proximal aortic surgery,"OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to evaluate whether 5-m gait speed, an established marker of frailty, is associated with postoperative events after elective proximal aortic surgery. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 435 patients aged more than 60 years who underwent elective proximal aortic surgery, defined as surgery on the aortic root, ascending aorta, or aortic arch through median sternotomy. Patients completed a 5-m gait speed test within 30 days before surgery. We evaluated the association between categoric (slow, ≤0.83 m/s and normal, >0.83 m/s) and continuous gait speed and the likelihood of experiencing the composite outcome before and after adjustment for European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II. The composite outcome included in-hospital mortality, renal failure, prolonged ventilation, and discharge location. Secondary outcomes were 1-year mortality and 5-year survival. RESULTS: Of the study population, 30.3% (132/435) were categorized as slow. Slow walkers were significantly more likely to have in-hospital mortality, prolonged ventilation, and renal failure, and were less likely to be discharged home (all P < .05). The composite outcome was 2 times more likely to occur for slow walkers (gait speed categoric adjusted odds ratio, 2.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.27-3.40; P = .004). Moreover, a unit (1 m/s) increase in gait speed (continuous) was associated with 73% lower risk of experiencing the composite outcome (odds ratio, 0.27; 95% confidence interval, 0.11-0.68; P = .006). CONCLUSIONS: Slow gait speed is a preoperative indicator of risk for postoperative events after elective proximal aortic surgery. Gait speed may be an important tool to complement existing operative risk models, and its application may identify patients who may benefit from presurgical and postsurgical rehabilitation.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 6765,Search update 2023-11-13,,

E.",Polypharmacy is predictive of postoperative complications in older adults undergoing ventral hernia repair,"BACKGROUND: Ventral hernias are common in older adults, and may be repaired via a transversus abdominus release (TAR). Older adults undergoing surgery have unique age-related risk factors, including polypharmacy. Polypharmacy is highly prevalent in older adults and is associated with adverse postoperative outcomes. Our aim was to examine the prevalence and association of polypharmacy with clinical outcomes in older adults undergoing a TAR. METHODS: Patients 60 years and older who underwent elective open or robotic bilateral TAR were included in the study. Average daily medications taken preoperatively was collected and stratified by tertiles. Baseline demographic data, peri- and postoperative outcomes, and 30-day outcomes were collected. RESULTS: There were 132 total patients with an average age of 67.8 years. The number of daily medications ranged from 0 to 28, with an overall mean of 11.2 medications. Patients in tertile 1 took an average of 5.3 medications, tertile 2 10.5 medications, and tertile 3 17.9 medications. Patients in tertile 3 had more than double the rate of in-hospital complications (0.7) compared to tertiles 1 and 2 (0.3 and 0.3, respectively; p = 0.03). A greater number of daily medications was independently associated with postoperative delirium [odds ratio (OR) 1.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0-1.3], cardiac events (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0-1.3), ICU stay (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0-1.3), and discharge to a skilled nursing facility (SNF) (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0-1.5). CONCLUSIONS: Polypharmacy was very common in older adults undergoing a TAR, and was associated with in-hospital complications, postoperative delirium, cardiac events, ICU stay, length of stay, and discharge to a SNF. Additional study is needed to assess if preoperative interventions to limit polypharmacy will improve outcomes for older adults undergoing a TAR.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16771,Search update 2023-11-13,,

E., Cooper, Z.",Which Geriatric Variables Most Strongly Inform Discharge Disposition After Emergency Surgery?,"INTRODUCTION: Older adults account for an increasing proportion of emergency surgical procedures and have longer hospital lengths of stay than their elective counterparts. Identifying those at greatest risk of discharge to a postacute care facility would improve postoperative planning. We aimed to examine the role of preoperative cognitive and functional status on discharge disposition after emergency surgery in older adults. METHODS: We used American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Geriatric Pilot Project data from 2014 to 2018 to identify patients ≥65 y who underwent inpatient emergency surgery. The primary outcome was nonhome discharge, defined as discharge to an acute rehabilitation facility, a skilled nursing facility, or a nonhome unskilled facility. Logistic regression controlling for patient characteristics was used to determine the association of preoperative geriatric-specific variables with nonhome discharge. RESULTS: Of 3494 patients, 53.9% were not discharged home. In multivariable analysis, a fall within the past year (odds ratio [OR] = 5.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.4-6.5) was most strongly associated with nonhome discharge. The outcome was also independently associated with preoperative use of a mobility aid (OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.7-2.4), partially dependent functional status (OR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.4-2.5), and surrogate consent (OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.1-1.8), but not cognitive impairment (OR = 1.0, 95% CI = 0.7-1.3). CONCLUSIONS: Assessing for a history of falls and impaired mobility at the initial surgical evaluation can rapidly identify patients most likely to need postacute care. Further work is needed to assess the association between pre-existing cognitive impairment and discharge disposition after emergency surgery.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 10902,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Methods: A total of 369 elderly patients scheduled for elective gastrointestinal tumor resection under general anesthesia were included. The cognitive function of each participant was assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 1 day before surgery and 7 days after surgery for the diagnosis of POCD. According to the results, patients were divided into a POCD group and a non-POCD group. The differences in hospitalization data and examination results between the two groups were compared. A logistic regression model was used to explore the risk factors for POCD in elderly patients undergoing gastrointestinal tumor resection, and a nomogram was then constructed based on these factors. The diagnostic performance of the nomogram was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and a calibration plot. The clinical usefulness of the nomogram was estimated using decision curve analysis (DCA). Results: Among the 369 patients undergoing gastrointestinal tumor resection, 79 patients had POCD, with a positive rate of 21.4%. The nomogram model comprised the following variables: age, body mass index (BMI), history of cerebrovascular disease, preoperative white blood cell (WBC) count, preoperative hemoglobin (Hb) level, intra-operative blood loss, and operation time. The model showed good discrimination, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.710 (95% CI = 0.645–0.775), and good calibration (Hosmer–Lemeshow test, χ2 = 5.133, p = 0.274). Internal validation also maintained ideal discrimination and calibration. Decision curves indicated that when the threshold probability was above 0.1, the nomogram achieved more benefit than both the treat-all and treat-none policies. Conclusion: This scoring system is the first nomogram model developed for the prediction of POCD in elderly patients undergoing gastrointestinal tumor resection. It has good efficacy in the prediction of POCD risk and could provide an important reference for the prevention, management, and treatment of POCD.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16773,Search update 2023-11-13,,

A total of 32 patients with diagnosed INPH and 18 age-matched healthy controls (HCs) were involved in this study. All subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including 3D pulsed arterial-spin labeling (PASL) for non-invasive perfusion imaging, and clinical symptom evaluation at baseline, and all patients with INPH were reexamined with clinical tests 1 month postoperatively. Patients with INPH had significantly lower whole-brain CBF than HCs, with the most significant differences in the high convexity, temporal lobe, precuneus, and thalamus. At baseline, there was a significant correlation between the CBF in the middle frontal gyrus, calcarine, inferior and middle temporal gyrus, thalamus, and posterior cingulate gyrus and poor gait manifestation. After shunting, improvements were negatively correlated with preoperative perfusion in the inferior parietal gyrus, inferior occipital gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus. Preoperative CBF in the middle frontal gyrus was positively correlated with the severity of preoperative cognitive impairment and negatively correlated with the change of postoperative MMSE score. There was a moderate positive correlation between anterior cingulate hypoperfusion and improved postoperative urination. Our study revealed that widely distributed and intercorrelated cortical and subcortical pathways are involved in the development of INPH symptoms, and preoperative CBF may be correlative to short-term shunt outcomes.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16387,Search update 2023-11-13,,

In this study, we investigated the correlation between inflammatory markers CRP and IL-6 and POD in elderly patients by literature search and meta-analysis. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane library, Embase, Ovid, and Springer Link for cohort studies or case-control studies that investigated the factors involved in the occurrence of POD, used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) to assess the quality of the selected literature, and combined the differences in serum CRP and IL-6 levels between POD and non-POD patients after surgery to evaluate the predictive value of CRP and IL-6 for the occurrence of POD. RESULTS: This research comprised 16 papers for quantitative analysis, with a total of 2967 patients, 758 with POD and 2209 with non-POD. There were 16 cohort studies (100%) and 0 case-control studies (0%) across all the collected literatures; there were 15 prospective cohort studies and 1 retrospective cohort research. A meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant difference in serum IL-6 levels between POD patients after surgery and non-POD patients [MD = 115.68, 95% CI (25.70, 206.66), Z = 2.52, P = 0.012], as well as a statistically significant difference in serum CRP levels [MD = 27.67, 95% CI (12.77, 42.58), Z = 3.64, P = 0.0003]. Discussion. Early after surgery, serum IL-6 and CRP levels were considerably higher in POD patients than in non-POD patients, indicating that early serum inflammatory variables are likely to be predictors of POD. After surgery, the levels of the aforementioned inflammatory factors should be actively monitored to forecast the emergence of delirium, and active treatment should be used to limit the creation and release of the aforementioned inflammatory factors.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16878,Search update 2023-11-13,,

We reviewed a prospectively maintained database of patients treated with extirpative surgery for pubovesical fistula from 2017-2021 who completed the SF-12. Wilcoxon signed-rank and McNemar's tests were used to analyze changes in SF-12 following surgery.

In emergency surgical settings, CGAs can be used to identify medical issues and geriatric syndromes among older patients and consequently try to improve their post-operative outcomes. However, there is a lack of geriatrician input in hospitals beyond medical wards, which means that older people who need emergency surgery do not always undergo a CGA, with potential negative repercussions for their post-operative outcomes. One solution to this issue is to employ advanced nurse practitioners (ANPs) to deliver equivalent services. This article presents and discusses the results of an audit of an ANP-led CGA service for older people admitted to hospital for emergency surgery. The ANP reviewed 147 patients during the audit period and identified frailty in 37% and new medical issues in 89% of patients. Interventions initiated by the ANP based on the CGA included requests for additional investigations, referral to allied health professionals and discharge planning.

The patients were 74 ± 7.8 years old. 65% of the patients were male. Mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 115 ± 37 minutes and mean cross-clamp time was 71 ± 23 minutes. There was a significant improvement in preoperative vs postoperative median MR grade (2 (IQR 2-3) vs 0 (IQR 0-1); P = 0.05). Follow-up transthoracic echocardiograms in 29 patients obtained at a median of 9 months' (range 3 - 19 months') and in 16 patients at a median of 34 months' postoperatively (range 21 - 53 months') showed mild (1 (IQR 1-2)) grade of mitral regurgitation. 30-day survival was 98%. Long term survival at 12 and 24 months' were 88% and 81% respectively. Mitral valve reoperation was conducted in 1 patient (2%), who was suffering of endocarditis. Stroke occurred in 2 patients (7%). Cardiac arrhythmia was observed in 15 patients (35%). 8 patients (19%) suffered from atrial fibrillation and 7 patients (16%) displayed atrioventricular blockage. 10 patients (23%) could be treated conservatively and 5 patients (12%) needed implantation of a pacemaker. Transaortic edge-to-edge mitral valve repair can be safely performed during aortic valve replacement in high-risk patients and improves even long-term MR grade. Postoperative cardiac arrhythmia occurs frequently. 66% of them could be treated successfully by conservative procedures.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 11300,Search update 2023-11-13,,

T., Baldini, G.",Future Perspectives on Prehabilitation Interventions in Cancer Surgery,"OBJECTIVE: This article provides a map of key knowledge gaps regarding the evidence supporting prehabilitation and its integration with enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) programs. Filling this lack of knowledge with future research will further establish the effectiveness of prehabilitation. DATA SOURCES: These are electronic databases including PubMed and CINAHL. CONCLUSION: Future efforts must embrace the elderly frail or cognitively impaired patient with specific needs to further promote restoration of postoperative function throughout the surgical pathway. Prehabilitation should be coupled and integrated within the existent concept of the ERAS framework, to facilitate the continuous evolution of screening, assessment, and optimization of high-risk surgical patients who are at risk of not being restored to physical and psychological function after surgery, including independence. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: In the future, the ERAS nurse will be an essential figure of the prehabilitation program, proactively coordinating the assessment, optimization, and adjustment of perioperative comorbidity and guiding the rehabilitation process to improve patients' outcomes. These skills and characteristics will be required to provide optimal nursing care in the context of an integrated prehabilitation ERAS pathway.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16836,Search update 2023-11-13,,

This study aimed to establish the potential risk factors for POD. METHODS: In total, 336 patients who underwent elective TJA under general anesthesia between 2018 and 2021 were included and deemed eligible for inclusion. POD was diagnosed based on the criteria by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM V). The receiver operating characteristic curve was drawn to evaluate the predictive and cut-off values of continuous variables for POD. Potential risk factors for POD were evaluated by binary univariate and multivariate analysis with the ""Enter"" method. RESULTS: According to the criteria by DSM V, 43 patients were categorized into the POD group, with an incidence of 12.8% (43 of 336). The receiver operating characteristic curve showed that albumin/fibrinogen ratio (AFR) was a good predictor for POD with an area under the curve of 0.754, cut-off value of 9.65, sensitivity of 57.00% and specificity of 83.72% (P <0.001). A low preoperative AFR level (<9.65) was determined as the only independent risk factor for POD by the univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses (OR: 2.45, 95% CI: 2.01-2.94, P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that a low AFR is an independent risk factor for POD in elderly subjects after TJA.

METHODS: This prospective study enrolled hip fracture patients aged ≥60 years who were admitted into our hospital between July 2011 and August 2019. Hip fractures were classified according to the Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteo-synthesefragen (AO) classification. This study included patients with isolated hip fracture and excluded patients with pathological or peri prosthetic fracture or patients with multiple traumatic injuries and high-energy trauma. They were randomized to receive conventional orthopedic care group (n = 65) or comprehensive orthopedic care group including preoperative psychological counseling and preventative risperidone (n = 63). Daily assessment was based on patient interview with the CAM-CR, and delirium was diagnosed by the Delirium Rating Scale (DRS-R-98). The rate, severity and duration of perioperative delirium and the length of postoperative stay were analyzed. RESULTS: Totally 200 patients were screened for eligibility. Twenty patients were excluded due to alcohol abuse and 40 were excluded because of brain lesions on head CT. In addition, 12 patients were excluded because of impaired cognition. Finally 128 patients were enrolled. Their mean age was 75.3 ± 2.2 years for the comprehensive orthopedic care group and 73.5 ± 6.1 years for the conventional orthopedic care group, and 53.9% of the patients were female. Sixty-eight (53.1%) patients had intertrochanteric fracture, 39.8% patients had femoral head fracture, and 7.0% patients had subtrochanteric fracture. In addition, 58.6% patients underwent internal fixation and 41.4% patients received arthroplasty. In this study, 63 patients were randomized to the comprehensive orthopedic care group and 65 patients to the conventional orthopedic care group. The two groups were comparable in demographic and baseline characteristics (P > 0.05). The rate of perioperative delirium was significantly lower in the comprehensive care group vs the conventional care group (15.9% vs. 30.8%; P < 0.05). The comprehensive care group had significantly reduced length of postoperative hospital stay vs the conventional care group (11.3 ± 2.5 days vs. 14.2 ± 2.2 days, P < 0.01). The mean DRS-R-98 score was 7.1 ± 2.7 for the comprehensive care group, and was significantly lower than that of the conventional orthopedic care group (11.2 ± 3.0; P < 0.05).

The aim of this study was to assess the dynamics of HRQoL change within 12 months after surgery and to identify predictors of deterioration in physical and mental health. METHODS: The cohort of this prospective study included 164 consecutive patients who underwent elective surgery. HRQoL was assessed on the basis of the Short-Form 36 questionnaire at three different times: upon admission and at 3 and 12 months after surgery. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was used to determine whether the surgery resulted in deterioration of HRQoL. RESULTS: In general, physical and mental health status improved within the first year after cardiac surgery. However, after 12 months, 7.9 and 21.2% of patients had clinically significant poorer physical (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores, based on the MCID approach. The results of multivariate analysis identified preoperative health status, age < 70 years, coronary artery bypass grafting, and a previous neurological event as predictors of deterioration in postoperative HRQoL. The greatest risks for deterioration were higher preoperative PCS and MCS scores. CONCLUSION: Although we were able to demonstrate a general improvement in the HRQoL following cardiac surgery, in one-fifth of patients, there was no recovery of mental health status even after 1 year. As this effect is mainly determined by preoperative functional status, HRQoL should be an integral part of medical consultation, especially in younger patients with a positive perception of quality of life.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 9763,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Current international guidelines do not include specific recommendations for treatment options of infective endocarditis (conventional vs. surgical) based on the patient’s age, functional status or comorbidities. Elderly patients have less invasive and often delayed surgeries compared to younger patients due to their shorter long-term survival probabilities. In the setting of IE, this might not be the right treatment, as surgery is the only curative option in up to 50% of all endocarditis patients. The aim of our study was to evaluate the mid- and long-term surgical outcomes due to infective endocarditis of patients aged ≥70 years. Methods: Between 2002 and 2020, a retrospective study with 137 patients aged 70 years and older and 276 patients aged below 70 years was conducted. Altogether, 413 consecutive patients who received surgery due to infective native or prosthetic valve endocarditis were assigned to either the elderly (E)-Group or the control (C)-Group. Primary endpoints were short- and long-term MACCEs (Major Adverse Cardiac and Cerebrovascular Events) as a composite of death or major adverse events, and secondary endpoints were intraoperative variables and postoperative course. Results: Preoperative risk factors differed significantly. Elderly patients had more arterial hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency and coronary heart disease. Fewer of them were in a state of emergency. Time from diagnosis to OR, antibiotic pretreatment, length of surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass time were significantly longer in the E-Group. Furthermore, 44.5% of patients in the E-Group had prosthesis endocarditis as opposed to 29.7% in the C-group. During postoperative follow-up, new onset of hemodialysis, duration of ventilation, delirium, reintubation and tracheotomy rates were significantly higher in the E-Group. There were significant differences in 7- and 30-day mortality. One- year survival was 62% for the E-Group and 79% for the C-Group. Five-year survival was 47% for the E-Group and 67% for the C-Group. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that surgery for infective endocarditis is a high-risk procedure, especially for elderly people. Nevertheless, as it is more or less the only concept to increase long-term survival, it should be offered generously to all patients who are still able to take care of themselves.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16966,Search update 2023-11-13,,

We aim to assess whether impairment of CVA during major oncologic surgery is associated with delayed neurocognitive recovery (DNCR) postoperatively. We performed a secondary analysis of prospectively collected data. Patients were included if they had undergone complete pre- and postoperative neuropsychological assessments, continuous intraoperative measurement of CVA, and major oncologic surgery for visceral, urological, or gynecological cancer. Intraoperative CVA was measured using the time-correlation method based on near-infrared-spectroscopy, and DNCR was assessed with a neuropsychological test battery. A decline in cognitive function before hospital discharge compared with a preoperative baseline assessment was defined as DNCR. One hundred ninety-five patients were included in the analysis. The median age of the study population was 65 years (IQR: 60-68); 11 patients (5.6%) were female. Forty-one patients (21.0%) fulfilled the criteria for DNCR in the early postoperative period. We found a significant association between impaired intraoperative CVA and DNCR before hospital discharge (OR = 1.042 [95% CI: 1.005; 1.080], p = 0.028). The type of surgery (radical prostatectomy vs. other major oncologic surgery; OR = 0.269 [95% CI: 0.099; 0.728], p = 0.010) and premedication with midazolam (OR = 3.360 [95% CI: 1.039; 10.870], p = 0.043) were significantly associated with the occurrence of DNCR in the early postoperative period. Intraoperative impairment of CVA is associated with postoperative neurocognitive function early after oncologic surgery. Therefore, intraoperative monitoring of CVA may be a target for neuroprotective interventions.

We prospectively evaluated geriatric assessment tools and developed a novel easy-to-use assessment tool for clinical use. METHODS: In 159 patients, geriatric assessment tools were used prior to cystectomy, prostatectomy, and renal tumor surgery, and their peri- and postoperative courses were recorded. Using all the tests, a short and easy-to-use assessment tool was developed, and nomograms were generated to predict functional outcomes and mortality. RESULTS: Of all the patients, 13.8% underwent radical cystectomy, 37.7% underwent radical prostatectomy, and 48.4% underwent tumor surgery of the kidney at the age of 70 years or older. The average age was 75.6 years. Incomplete functional recovery at day 30 and day 180 was observed in 37.7% and 36.1% of the patients, respectively, and incomplete functional recovery was associated with impaired mobility, previous care dependency, frailty, comorbidities, and a high ASA score. The only predictor for high-grade complications was comorbidities, whereas mortality was associated with the geriatric screening tool scores, impaired mobility, preoperative care dependency, and comorbidities. The Erlangen Index (EI), a combination of the selected assessment tools, showed a good prediction of early (p = 0.002) and medium-term (p = 0.002) functional outcomes and mortality (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our prospective evaluation confirms the high risk of incomplete functional recovery, high-grade complications, and mortality in older patients undergoing major urological tumor surgery. The EI is an easy-to-use preoperative assessment tool and therefore should be used in preoperative patient counseling.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 5742,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Methods: This prospective observational cohort study was performed in a PACU at a high-volume prostate cancer center. We used a convenience sample of patients > 60 years undergoing elective radical prostatectomy. Patients with a history of cerebrovascular or neurodegenerative disease were excluded. Fifteen, 30, 45, and 60 following extubation, patients were screened for signs of delirium with the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit. Three months after surgery self-reported cognitive function was assessed with the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire, and health status was evaluated with the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). Results: Signs of PACU delirium were present in 32.4% (n = 72/222) of patients, and 80.2% (n = 178/222) completed the 3-month follow-up. The presence of PACU delirium signs was not significantly associated with self-reported cognitive failures (B = 0.60, 95% CI: −1.72; 2.92, p = 0.61) or SF-36 physical component scores (B = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.02; 0.36, p = 0.03) or SF-36 mental component scores (B = −0.03, 95% CI: −0.18, 0.11, p = 0.66) 3 months after radical prostatectomy. Conclusions: In a cohort of educated, highly functioning, elderly male patients who were assessed immediately after surgery and at a 3-month follow-up, we found no association between PACU delirium and self-reported cognitive failures or perceived health status, which implies that PACU delirium may be an event of limited duration and impact.

Measurements and Main Results: ICU stay (p = 0.010), postoperative time until first fluid intake (p < 0.0001), and duration of mechanical ventilation (p = 0.004) were shorter in the CS group than in the GA group. No patients converted to GA from CS. PaCO2 during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in the CS group was significantly lower than that in the GA group. However, PaCO2 at the termination of CPB in the CS group was significantly higher than that in the GA group. Conclusions: In the CS group, advanced-age patients with comorbidities underwent mitral surgery without postoperative complications.

As a result, the number of elderly and frail patients undergoing total hip and knee arthroplasty is projected to increase significantly in the coming years. In order to reduce risk of complications and improve postoperative outcome, it can be beneficial to optimally prepare geriatric patients before orthopaedic surgery and to provide perioperative care by a multiprofessional orthogeriatric team. The aim of this comprehensive interventional study is to assess wether multimorbid patients can benefit from the new care model of special orthopaedic geriatrics (SOG) in elective total hip and knee arthroplasty. METHODS: The SOG study is a registered, monocentric, prospective, randomized controlled trial (RCT) funded by the German Federal Joint Committee (GBA). This parallel group RCT with a total of 310 patients is intended to investigate the specially developed multimodal care model for orthogeriatric patients with total hip and knee arthroplasty (intervention group), which already begins preoperatively, in comparison to the usual orthopaedic care without orthogeriatric co-management (control group). Patients ≥70 years of age with multimorbidity or generally patients ≥80 years of age due to increased vulnerability with indication for elective primary total hip and knee arthroplasty can be included in the study. Exclusion criteria are age < 70 years, previous bony surgery or tumor in the area of the joint to be treated, infection and increased need for care (care level ≥ 4). The primary outcome is mobility measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Secondary outcomes are morbidity, mortality, postoperative complications, delirium, cognition, mood, frailty, (instrumental) activities of daily living, malnutrition, pain, polypharmacy, and patient reported outcome measures. Tertiary outcomes are length of hospital stay, readmission rate, reoperation rate, transfusion rate, and time to rehabilitation. The study data will be collected preoperative, postoperative day 1 to 7, 4 to 6 weeks and 3 months after surgery. DISCUSSION: Studies have shown that orthogeriatric co-management models in the treatment of hip fractures lead to significantly reduced morbidity and mortality rates. However, there are hardly any data available on the elective orthopaedic care of geriatric patients, especially in total hip and knee arthroplasty. In contrast to the care of trauma patients, optimal preoperative intervention is usually possible. TRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00024102.

We aimed to test the hypothesis that intraoperative low V(T) ventilation affect the incidence of postoperative ICD-10 coded delirium and/or the need for antipsychotic medications. METHODS: This is a post-hoc analysis of a large randomized controlled trial evaluating low vs. conventional V(T) ventilation during major non-cardiothoracic, non-intracranial surgery. The primary outcome was the incidence of ICD-10 delirium and/or the use of antipsychotic medications during hospital stay, and the absolute difference with its 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. RESULTS: We studied 1206 patients (median age of 64 [55-72] years, 59.0% males, median ARISCAT of 26 [19-37], and 47.6% of ASA 3). ICD-10 coded delirium and /or antipsychotic medication use was diagnosed in 11.2% with similar incidence between low and conventional V(T) ventilation (11.1% vs. 11.3%; absolute difference, -0.24 [95%CI, -3.82 to 3.32]; p = 0.894). There was no interaction between allocation group and type of surgery. CONCLUSION: In adult patients undergoing major surgery, low V(T) ventilation was not associated with increased risk of ICD-10 delirium and/or the use of antipsychotic medications during hospital stay.

In total, 529 patients had comorbidities (52%), including allergic diseases (n=220, 33%), respiratory diseases (n=107, 16%), neurologic and psychiatric diseases (n=69, 10%), gynecologic diseases (n=28, 4%), hematologic diseases (n=27, 4%), cardiovascular diseases (n=24, 4%), digestive diseases (n=22, 3%), metabolic and endocrine diseases (n=18, 3%), spinal diseases (n=11, 2%), ophthalmologic diseases (n=11, 2%), renal and urological diseases (n=9, 1%), and other diseases (n=117, 18%). Among the patients with comorbidities, 11 with hemorrhagic diatheses (hemophilia and von Willebrand disease), arrhythmia (atrioventricular block), psychiatric disease (adjustment disorder), and metabolic disease (diabetes) required cautious perioperative management. The patient with hemophilia was managed with regular low-dose recombinant factor VIII replacement therapy, and the patient with type I diabetes mellitus was administered continuous insulin infusion and sliding-scale insulin therapy; both patients had an uneventful course. Conclusions: The study findings suggest that with the increase in orthognathic surgeries, oral and maxillofacial surgeons should adequately manage cases requiring cautious perioperative control and highlight the importance of preoperative screening. Despite the well-established safety and postoperative stability of orthognathic surgeries, oral surgeons should adopt appropriate additional preventive measures for patients with comorbidities. © 2022, The Author(s).",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16391,Search update 2023-11-13,,

M.",The Risk of Preoperative Central Nervous System-Acting Medications on Delirium Following Hip or Knee Surgery: A Matched Case-Control Study,"Introduction: Medicines acting on the central nervous system can increase the risk of postoperative delirium, but the specific medicines associated with greatest risk remain unclear. Objectives: We aimed to examine the risk of individual central nervous system-acting medicines used preoperatively on delirium after hip or knee surgery. Methods: A matched case-control study was conducted using data from the Australian Government Department of Veterans’ Affairs. We included people aged 65 years or older who had knee or hip surgery between 2000 and 2019. People with hip or knee surgery who developed postoperative delirium were cases and controls were people with hip or knee surgery but who did not develop postoperative delirium. Use of medicines including anxiolytics, sedatives, and hypnotics, opioid analgesics and antidepressants prior to surgery was compared between cases and controls. Results: A total of 2614 patient cases with postoperative delirium were matched by same sex, age (±2 years), and year of admission (±2 years) with 7842 controls without postoperative delirium. Cases were more likely to be exposed to nitrazepam (odds ratio [OR] = 1.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24–2.64), sertraline (OR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.20–1.87), mirtazapine (OR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.11–1.74), venlafaxine (OR = 1.42, 95% CI 1.02–1.98), citalopram (OR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.19–1.99), escitalopram (OR = 1.42, 95% CI 1.06–1.89) or fluvoxamine (OR = 5.01, 95% CI 2.15–11.68) prior to surgery than controls. At the class level, exposure to benzodiazepines (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.05–1.37) and antidepressants (OR = 1.64, 95% CI 1.47–1.83) prior to surgery was significantly higher in cases than in controls. The numbers needed to treat to harm for one additional delirium case were 43 for sertraline, 40 for citalopram, 57 for mirtazapine and 26 for nitrazepam. Whereas, the numbers needed to treat to harm were found to be 20 for sertraline, 17 for citalopram, 19 for mirtazapine and 10 for nitrazepam in the 85 years or older age group, indicating that the harmful effect of these medicines is pronounced as age advances. Conclusions: People who developed delirium following hip or knee surgery were more likely to be exposed to nitrazepam, sertraline, mirtazapine, venlafaxine, citalopram, escitalopram or fluvoxamine at the time of admission for surgery. Planning to reduce use of these medicines well prior to surgery may decrease the risk of postoperative delirium.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 9628,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Methods: Sixty patients undergoing lobectomy by video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) were randomly assigned to general anesthesia with desflurane or propofol. Lungs were inspected by thoracoscope at 10, 30, and 60 min after initiation of OLV. After surgery, the Lung Collapse Score, a composite of lung color and volume assessments, was assigned by two clinicians blinded to the anesthetic regimen. The primary outcome was operation time. The secondary outcome included the complication rate. Results: Of the 60 participants, 50 completed the study, 26 in Desflurane group and 24 in Propofol group. The Lung Collapse Scores at 30 and 60 min after OLV initiation were significantly better in Desflurane group than in Propofol group, and operation time was significantly shorter in Desflurane group (214 (57) min vs. 262 (72) min [mean (SD)], difference in means, -48; 95% CI, -85 to -11; P = 0.01). The incidence of multiple complications was 1/26 (3%) and 6/24 (25%) in Desflurane and Propofol group, respectively (relative risk, 0.1; 95% CI, 0.02 to 1.18; P = 0.04). Conclusions: Desflurane improved lung collapse during OLV and significantly shortened VATS lobectomy operation time compared to propofol in our studied patients. Desflurane resulted in fewer postoperative complications. Thus, desflurane may be an appropriate anesthetic during lobectomy by VATS requiring OLV.

In a multicentre prospective cohort study, we investigate the incidence and risk factors of postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery. METHODS: Patients were consented and recruited from 4 major hospitals in Singapore. Research ethics approval was obtained. Patients older than 65 years undergoing non-cardiac surgery >2 hours were recruited. Baseline perioperative data were collected. Preoperative baseline cognition was obtained. Patients were assessed in the post-anaesthesia care unit for delirium 30-60 minutes after arrival using the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (Nu-DESC). RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients completed the study. Eleven patients (11.2%) had postoperative delirium. Patients who had PACU delirium were older (74.6±3.2 versus 70.6±4.4 years, P=0.005). Univariate analysis showed those who had PACU delirium are more likely to be ASA 3 (63.6% vs 31.0%, P=0.019), had estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of >60mL/min/1.73m2 (36.4% vs 10.6%, P=0.013), higher HbA1C value (7.8±1.2 vs 6.6±0.9, P=0.011), raised random blood glucose (10.0±5.0mmol/L vs 6.5±2.4mmol/L, P=0.0066), and moderate-severe depression (18.2% vs 1.1%, P=0.033).

Therefore, determining biological age, and risks connected with it, should be the key factor in the preoperative assessment. It may be accomplished by using a Geriatric Assessment (GA). However, it is not established which components are most useful for predicting short- and long-term postoperative outcomes in cancer patients undergoing high-risk abdominal surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 334 consecutive cancer patients aged ≥70 years underwent elective abdominal surgery and were followed-up prospectively for 12 months. The preoperative GA consisted of eight domains: functional, physical activity, comorbidity, polypharmacotherapy, nutritional, cognition, mood, and social support. Logistic regression analyses were used to analyse the predictive ability. RESULTS: All components of GA were independent risk factors of 30-day major morbidity apart from ADL, BOMC, Polypharmacy (OR 0.6-1.3; p < 0.001). However, ADL, TUG, the polypharmacy and the MOS-SSS turned out to be significant predictors of 30-day mortality (OR 0.72-1.46; p < 0.001). In turn, only ADL, CDT and MOS-SSS were valid predictors of 12-months mortality (OR 0.46-0.85; p < 0.001). Frailty (surrogate of the biological age), not the chronological age, were also independent predictors of all outcomes (OR 4.71-8.56 p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Not the chronological age but components of GA and frailty are significant predictors of both 30-day postoperative outcome and 12-months mortality in older cancer patients undergoing high-risk abdominal surgery.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16914,Search update 2023-11-13,,

A.",Adverse perioperative outcomes among patients undergoing gastrointestinal cancer surgery: Quantifying attributable risk from malnutrition,"Background: Preoperative malnutrition adversely impacts perioperative outcomes among patients with gastrointestinal (GI) cancer. The attributable risk (AR) that nutrition status contributes towards negative outcomes is poorly understood. Methods: Adults undergoing GI cancer surgeries were identified within the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database (2005–2017). Emergency surgeries, outpatients, and cases with an American Society of Anesthesiologists status above III were excluded. Adjusted multivariable models were constructed to determine the associations between markers of nutrition status (body mass index, >10% weight loss in last 6 months, functional status, and serum albumin level) and adverse perioperative outcomes (presence and number of complications, death, 30-day readmission, and length of stay). Predictive accuracy statistics and population AR (PAR) were determined. Results: The final sample included 78,662 cases. Patients with >10% weight loss 6 months preceding surgery (compared with those who did not), had a significantly increased risk of complications (Relative Risk = 1.28; 95% CI, 1.20–1.37) and odds of death (odds ratio [OR] = 1.37; 95% CI, 1.18–1.59). A totally dependent functional status (compared with independent status) was associated with a 3.3-times higher odds of death (OR = 3.30; 95% CI, 1.53–7.15). Multivariable models were not predictive of adverse outcomes; PAR from the markers ranged 1%–2%. Conclusion: Ten percent weight loss in preceding 6 months was associated with increased risk of adverse perioperative outcomes among adults undergoing GI cancer surgery. The contribution of nutrition status markers to surgical outcomes as assessed by PAR was small (1%–2%), a finding not previously reported. Future intervention studies should include validated nutrition risk markers, control for effects of perioperative variables, and evaluate PAR within the immediate/long-term postoperative periods. © 2021 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16397,Search update 2023-11-13,,

The aim of our study was to reveal whether the CFS allows a reliable prediction of overall survival (OS) in patients after surgical treatment of brain metastases (BM) compared to the Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS). METHODS: Patients operated for BM were included. CFS and KPS were retrospectively assessed pre- and postoperatively and at follow-up 3-6 months after resection. RESULTS: 205 patients with a follow-up of 22.8 months (95% CI 18.4-27.1) were evaluated. CFS showed a median of 3 (""managing well""; IqR 2-4) at all 3 assessment-points. Median KPS was 80 preoperatively (IqR 80-90) and 90 postoperatively (IqR 80-100) as well as at follow-up after 3-6 months. CFS correlated with KPS both preoperatively (r = - 0.92; p < 0.001), postoperatively (r = - 0.85; p < 0.001) and at follow-up (r = - 0.93; p < 0.001). The CFS predicted the expected reduction of OS more reliably than the KPS at all 3 assessments. A one-point increase (worsening) of the preoperative CFS translated into a 30% additional hazard to decease (HR 1.30, 95% CI 1.15-1.46; p < 0.001). A one-point increase in postoperative and at follow-up CFS represents a 39% (HR 1.39, 95% CI 1.25-1.54; p < 0.001) and of 42% risk (HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.27-1.59; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The CFS is a feasible, simple and reliable scoring system in patients undergoing resection of brain metastasis.

R., Subramaniam, B.",Twelve-Month Cognitive and Functional Outcomes Following Cardiac Surgery: The DEXACET Trial of Intravenous Acetaminophen Versus Placebo,"Background: Delirium, an acute decline in attention and global cognitive dysfunction, occurs frequently following cardiac surgery and has been demonstrated to be significantly associated with cognitive dysfunction and reduced functional ability. In the DEXACET trial, we demonstrated a significant reduction in postoperative in-hospital delirium with intravenous (IV) acetaminophen when compared with placebo. In this analysis we examined whether this protective association also extended to 12 month cognitive and functional outcomes. Methods: This study was a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, triple-blinded, factorial design trial conducted at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, approved by the IRB. In this trial, 120 older cardiac surgical patients were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous (IV) acetaminophen or placebo in addition to propofol or dexmedetomidine. Those receiving IV acetaminophen displayed a significant reduction in in-hospital delirium. We collected cognitive, mood and functional outcome data using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, telephone version (T-MoCA), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the Basic and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADLs, IADLs) at 1 month and 12 months after surgery. Results: Of the 120 enrolled patients in the primary trial, 93 (77.5%) and 83 (69.2%) patients responded to assessments at 1 month and 12 months, respectively. No statistically significant differences in median T-MoCA scores were observed between acetaminophen and placebo groups at 1 month (18.0 vs.18.0, p = 0.52) or 12 months (19.0 vs.18.0, p = 0.62) following surgery. There were similarly no differences in GDS, ADLs or IADLs between treatment groups. Losses to follow-up limited the sample sizes and 10 of the 23 (45%) original study participants who had postoperative delirium were lost to follow up. Conclusion: Administration of intravenous acetaminophen was not associated with a difference in long term cognitive or functional status following cardiac surgery.

It is recommended to recognize the post-transplant risks and establish a treatment strategy. We report the case of a patient who underwent 2 laparotomy hemostasis procedures due to frailty after kidney transplantation. CASE REPORT: A 72-year-old woman presented with end-stage renal failure due to an unknown primary disease. She was also found to be frail when assessed using the physical frailty phenotype. She underwent ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation from her husband at the end of March 2020. On the first postoperative day, re-operation for hematoma evacuation was performed. The bleeding point could not be identified at that time. Progression of anemia was observed on the sixth postoperative day, and computed tomography showed no obvious bleeding. Subsequently, the renal allograft started functioning immediately, without rejection. However, emergency laparotomy for hematoma removal was performed on the 22nd postoperative day. Bleeding had occurred from the anastomotic region of the renal allograft artery and the external iliac artery. Her serum creatinine levels and renal function remained stable one month after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: We encountered a case of living-donor kidney transplantation in a frail older woman who underwent 2 laparotomies due to hemorrhage.

We investigated whether a short-term switch of sevoflurane to desflurane at the end of sevoflurane-anesthesia enhances patient postoperative recovery profile in non-obese patients. We randomly divide patients undergoing elective surgery (n = 60) into two groups: sevoflurane-anesthesia group (Group-S, n = 30) and sevoflurane-desflurane group (Group-SD, n = 30). In Group-S, patients received only sevoflurane-anesthesia until the end of surgery (for >2 hours). In Group-SD, sevoflurane was stopped and switched to desflurane-anesthesia before the completion of sevoflurane-anesthesia (for approximately 30 minutes). We assessed the intergroup differences in the times to get eye-opening, extubation, and a bispectral index of 80 (BIS-80). Group-SD showed significantly shorter times to get eye-opening (438 ± 101 vs. 295 ± 45 s; mean difference, 143 s; 95% confidence interval [CI], 101-183; p < 0.001), extubation (476 ± 108 vs. 312 ± 42 s; mean difference, 164 s; 95% CI, 116-220; p < 0.001), and BIS-80 (378 ± 124 vs. 265 ± 49 minutes; mean difference, 113 s; 95% CI, 58-168 p < 0.001) compared to Group-S. There was no between-group difference in postoperative nausea, vomiting, and hypoxia incidences.

Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess patients' perspectives on their keloids after treatment by comparing preoperative and postoperative surveys. Methods: All patients seen at the keloid clinic, both preoperatively and postoperatively, were contacted by telephone call. Information about demographics, keloid characteristics, and levels of pain and pruritus were recorded.

The use of uncomplicated frailty measurement tools is preferred in busy clinical settings. Therefore, we validated the frailty index using routine laboratory data and the surgical outcomes of older patients with cancer who underwent cancer resection. We retrospectively analyzed 9015 patients aged 65 years and older who underwent cancer resection at a single tertiary hospital. Based on electronic-medical-record data regarding preoperative blood test results and vital signs, Laboratory Frailty Index (FI-Lab) scores were generated to measure preoperative frailty. The associations of FI-Lab with postoperative length of stay (LOS), readmission within 30 days, intensive care unit (ICU) admission within 30 days, and mortality were evaluated. The mean FI-Lab score of the 9015 patients was 0.20 ± 0.10. Increased FI-Lab scores (0.25-0.4; > 0.4) were associated with longer LOS, increased readmission within 30 days of surgery, ICU admission, and increased mortality, compared with FI-Lab scores < 0.25.

METHODS: Of the total 1097 patients recruited at a German university hospital (from September 2018 to October 2019) in the PROPDESC prospective observational study, 588 patients aged 70 years and older (mean age 77.2 ± 4.7 years) were included for subgroup analysis. The primary endpoint POD was considered positive if one of the following tests were positive on any of the five postoperative visit days: Confusion Assessment Method for ICU (CAM-ICU), Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), 4'A's (4AT) and Delirium Observation Scale (DOS). Trained doctoral students carried out these visitations and additionally the nursing staff were interviewed for completion of the DOS. To evaluate the independent effect of POD on LOS in ICU and in hospital, a multi-variable linear regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: The POD incidence was 25.9%. The results of our model showed POD as an independent predictor for a prolonged LOS in ICU (36%; 95% CI 4-78%; < 0.001) and in hospital (22%; 95% CI 4-43%; < 0.001). CONCLUSION: POD has an independent impact on LOS in ICU and in hospital. Based on the effect of POD for the elderly, a standardized risk screening is required.

A systematic review,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Frailty as a concept is not yet fully understood, and is not the same as comorbidity. It is associated with an increased risk of adverse events and mortality after surgery, which makes its preoperative assessment significant. Despite its relevance, it still remains unclear which scales are appropriate for use in patients with spinal pathology. PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility and measurement properties of frailty scales for spine patients, specifically with adult spinal deformity (ASD), and to propose adequate scales for primary triage to prevent surgery in too frail patients and for preoperative assessment to modify patients' condition and surgical plans. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Systematic review. METHODS: Systematic search was performed between 2010 and 2021 including terms relating to spinal disorders, frailty scales, and methodological quality. Characteristics of the studies and frailty scales and data describing relation to treatment outcomes were extracted. The risk of bias was determined with the QAREL score. RESULTS: Of the 1993 references found, 88 original studies were included and 23 scales were identified. No prospective interventional study was found where the preoperative frailty assessment was implemented. Predictive value of scales for surgical outcomes varied, dependent on spinal disorders, type of surgeries, patients' age and frailty at baseline, and outcomes. Seventeen studies reported measurement properties of eight scales but these studies were not free of bias. In 30 ASD studies, ASD-Frailty Index (ASD-FI, n=14) and 11-item modified Frailty Index (mFI-11, n=11) were most frequently used. These scales were mainly studied in registry studies including young adult population, and carry a risk of sample bias and make their validity in elderly population unclear. ASD-FI covers multidisciplinary concepts of frailty with 40 items but its feasibility in clinical practice is questionable due to its length. The Risk Analysis Index, another multidisciplinary scale with 14 items, has been implemented for preoperative assessment in other surgical domains and was proven to be feasible and effective in interventional prospective studies. The FRAIL is a simple questionnaire with five items and its predictive value was confirmed in prospective cohort studies in which only elderly patients were included. CONCLUSIONS: No adequate scale was identified in terms of methodological quality and feasibility for daily practice. Careful attention should be paid when choosing an adequate scale, which depends on the setting of interest (eg triage or preoperative work-up). We recommend to further study a simple and predictive scale such as FRAIL for primary triage and a comprehensive and feasible scale such as Risk Analysis Index for preoperative assessment for patients undergoing spine surgery, as their adequacy has been shown in other medical domains.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 6808,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Intertrochanteric fracture (IF) is a common injury among the elderly. Due to significant comorbidities, anesthesia for IF repair may be challenging. The authors propose femoral nerve block together with a lateral femoral cutaneous nerve block and sedation as an anesthetic technique for most severe cases of IF with contraindications to spinal anesthesia. Methods. In total, 61 patients were enrolled prospectively in a study, 19 received general anesthesia (GA group), 22 spinal anesthesia (SA group), and 20 nerve blocks with sedation (PNB group). Results. Groups were comparable in terms of age, gender, independence, and several comorbidities: diabetes, obesity, underweight, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular incidents in the past, dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and frailty. Heart failure (p = 0.033), hemoglobin < 10 g/dL (p = 0.001) and eGFR < 30 mL/min (p = 0.039) were more frequent in PNB group. PNB group had higher American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) (p < 0.001), Nottingham Hip Fracture Score (NHFS) (p < 0.001), and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) (p = 0.002) scales scores, and lower probability of 10-year survival according to CCI (p = 0.012). GA group had more frequent active malignancy (p = 0.041). GA and PNB groups had a higher frequency of hemostasis disorder (p < 0.001). Surgery was completed under the scheduled anesthesia technique. Survival, frequency of cardio and cerebrovascular incidents after surgery, loss of independence, and postoperative delirium were comparable between groups, as well as the length of postoperative stay. Conclusions. Surgical repair of intertrochanteric fracture with intramedullary nailing system among elderly, frail, and sick patients can be conducted under peripheral nerve block. FNB and LFCNB in the combination is a viable option for IT fracture repair.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16401,Search update 2023-11-13,,

F.",The Clinical Frailty Scale as predictor of overall survival after resection of high-grade glioma,"BACKGROUND: The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) describes the general level of fitness or frailty and is widely used in geriatric medicine, intensive care and orthopaedic surgery. This study was conducted to analyze, whether CFS could be used for patients with high-grade glioma. METHODS: Patients harboring high-grade gliomas, undergoing first resection at our center between 2015 and 2020 were retrospectively evaluated. Patients' performance was assessed using the Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale and the Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) preoperatively and 3-6 months postoperatively. RESULTS: 289 patients were included. Pre- as well as postoperative median frailty was 3 CFS points (IqR 2-4) corresponding to ""managing well"". CFS strongly correlated with KPS preoperatively (r = - 0.85; p < 0.001) and at the 3-6 months follow-up (r = - 0.90; p < 0.001). The reduction of overall survival (OS) was 54% per point of CFS preoperatively (HR 1.54, CI 95% 1.38-1.70; p < 0.001) and 58% at the follow-up (HR 1.58, CI 95% 1.41-1.78; p < 0.001), comparable to KPS. Patients with IDH mutation showed significantly better preoperative and follow-up CFS and KPS (p < 0.05). Age and performance scores correlated only mildly with each other (r = 0.21…0.35; p < 0.01), but independently predicted OS (p < 0.001 each). CONCLUSION: CFS seems to be a reliable tool for functional assessment of patients suffering from high-grade glioma. CFS includes non-cancer related aspects and therefore is a contemporary approach for patient evaluation. Its projection of survival can be equally estimated before and after surgery. IDH-mutation caused longer survival and higher functionality.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16804,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Demographic data, surgery type, frailty measure, and postoperative outcomes predicted by frailty were extracted from the selected studies. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The selected studies (mean age: 56.1-76.3 years) had low-to-moderate risk of bias and included 16 vascular (elective and nonelective) surgeries and eight frailty measures. Significant associations (p < 0.05) were established between mortality (30-day, 90-day, 1-year, 5-year), 30-day morbidity, nonhome discharge, adverse events, failure to rescue, patient requiring care after discharge, and amputation following critical limb ischaemia. The strongest evidence was found between 30-day mortality and frailty. Composite 30-day morbidity and mortality, functional status at discharge, length of stay, spinal cord deficit, and access site complications were found to be nonsignificantly associated with frailty. With frailty being significantly associated with several adverse postoperative outcomes, preoperative frailty assessments can potentially be clinically useful in helping practitioners predict and guide the pre-, peri-, and postoperative management of frail with vascular disease.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 6704,Search update 2023-11-13,,

The study aimed to estimate the frequency of and identify risk factors for PD in a unified sample of head and neck surgery patients. METHODS: The investigators implemented a retrospective cohort study composing of patients undergoing free flap reconstructive surgery over 1 year. The predictor variables were identified as 146 general and periprocedural parameters. The primary outcome variable was PD (+ or -). Descriptive and bivariate statistics were performed to identify existing correlations between the predictive factors and PD and the P-value was set at .05. A logistic regression model (LRM) was created to adjust for possible confounding factors and reveal possible independent prognostic factors for the onset of PD. RESULTS: Hundred patients (group 1, 18 with PD+, group 2, 82 without PD) undergoing microvascular free flap (65 males, 35 females, mean age = 65 [range 18 to 84 years]) surgery were recruited. The investigators identified 15 variables that were statistically associated with PD. In the LRM, after adjusting for age, diabetes status, and preoperative TSH, free fibula transplants (FT) as type of surgery was associated with an increased risk for PD (FT, Odds Ratio (OR) 6.3 (1.6 to 25.7, P = .01). CONCLUSION: The investigators identified 15 variables associated with an increased risk of developing PD, one of which had a statistically significant association after adjusting for other variables in a LRM. Future research efforts should be devoted to assessing the use of these variables for predicting PD further. Since the use of FT showed to be an independent prognostic parameter for the development of PD in this study, patients receiving FT should get special attention in the first days after surgery to prevent PD and associated complications such as increased mortality and prolonged hospital stays.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 9431,Search update 2023-11-13,,

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5th edition (DSM-5) is the golden standard for diagnosing perioperative NCDs. Given the impracticality of using the DSM-5 by non-psychiatric practitioners, many diagnostic tools have been developed and validated for different clinical scenarios. The etiology of perioperative NCDs is multifactorial and includes predisposing and precipitating factors. Identifying these risk factors is conducive to preoperative risk stratification and perioperative risk reduction. Prevention for perioperative NCDs should include avoiding possible contributors and implementing nonpharmacologic and pharmacological interventions. The former generally includes avoiding benzodiazepines, anticholinergics, prolonged liquid fasting, deep anesthesia, cerebral oxygen desaturation, and intraoperative hypothermia. Nonpharmacologic measures include preoperative cognitive prehabilitation, comprehensive geriatric assessment, implementing fast-track surgery, combined use of regional block, and sleep promotion. Pharmacological measures including dexmedetomidine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and acetaminophen are found to have beneficial effects. Nonpharmacological treatments are the first-line measures for established perioperative NCDs.

Material and methods. A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial enrolled 200 patients aged 60–80 years who underwent elective cardiac or orthopedic surgery. The patients received either the study drug (inosine + nicotinamide + riboflavin + succinate) (treatment group, n=101) or a placebo (con-trol group, n=99) intravenously for 7 days then orally for 25 days. Efficacy was assessed by the change in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA) score at the end of the treatment course compared with the preoperative level. Results. Before surgery, the total MoCA score values did not differ between the groups. By the end of the treatment course (31 days after surgery), the MoCA total score was 26.4±1.96 in the main group and 25.0±2.83 in the control group (P<0.001). The intergroup difference in the mean change in the MoCA total score on day 31 was 1.56 points (95% CI 1.015; 2.113; P<0.0001) favoring the study drug in all randomized population. The lower limit of CI (1.015) exceeded the limit of superiority set by the protocol (0.97 points), which allowed acceptance of the hypothesis of superiority of the study drug over placebo with respect to the primary efficacy criterion. No significant differences in the frequency of adverse events were found between the groups. Conclusion. The succinate-containing study drug demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and helped to reduce the severity of postoperative cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients who underwent a major surgery, which allows recommending the drug for prevention of postoperative cognitive impairment in high-risk patients.",duplicate of 16405,Search update 2023-11-13,,

We developed and tested an abbreviated method of frailty assessment using variables routinely collected by the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) registry. METHODS: An abbreviated frailty score (the simple Vascular Quality Initiative-Frailty Score [VQI-FS]) was developed using 11 or fewer VQI variables (hypertension, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal impairment, anemia, underweight, nonhome residence, and nonambulatory status) that map to recognized frailty domains in the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment and the literature. Nonemergent cases registered in the VQI from 2010 to 2017 (n = 265,632) in seven registries (carotid endarterectomy, n = 77,111; carotid artery stenting, n = 13,215; endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, n = 29,607; open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, n = 7442; infrainguinal bypass, n = 33,128; suprainguinal bypass, n = 10,661; and peripheral vascular intervention, n = 94,468) were analyzed using logistic regression models to determine the predictive power of the VQI-FS for perioperative and longer term (9-month) mortality. Nomograms were created using weighted regression coefficients to assist in individualized frailty assessment and estimation of 9-month mortality. RESULTS: The VQI-FS, using equal weighting of these 11 VQI variables, effectively predicted 9-month mortality with an area under the curve of 0.724 by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. However, differential weighting of the variables allowed simplification of the model to only seven variables (congestive heart failure, renal impairment, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, not living at home, not ambulatory, anemia, and underweight status); hypertension, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and diabetes had relatively low predictive power. Adding procedure-specific risk further improved performance of the model with a final area under the curve on receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of 0.758. Model calibration was excellent with predicted/observed regression line slope of 0.991 and intercept of 5.449e-04. CONCLUSIONS: A differentially weighted abbreviated VQI-FS using seven variables in addition to procedure-specific risk has strong correlation with 9-month mortality. Nomograms incorporating patient- and procedure-adjusted risk can effectively predict 9-month mortality. Reliable estimates of longer term mortality should assist in preoperative decision-making for vascular procedures that often carry substantial risk of mortality.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16897,Search update 2023-11-13,,

METHODS: Patients aged >90 years who had undergone abdominal aortic aneurysm repair from 2005 to 2017 were identified using procedure codes. Those with operative times <15 minutes were excluded. The demographics, preoperative comorbidities, and postoperative complications of those who had died by 30 days were compared with those of the patients alive at 30 days. RESULTS: A total of 1356 nonagenarians met the criteria: 1229 (90.6%) had undergone EVAR and 127 (9.4%) had undergone OSR. The overall 30-day mortality was 10.4%. The patients who had died within 30 days were significantly more likely to have undergone OSR than EVAR (40.9% vs 7.2%; P < .001). They also had a greater incidence of dependent functional status (22.0% for those who had died vs 8.1% for those alive at 30 days; P < .001), American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) classification of ≥4 (81.2% vs 18.8%; P < .001), perioperative blood transfusion (59.6% vs 20.3%; P < .001), postoperative pneumonia (12.1% vs 2.9%; P = .001), mechanical ventilation >48 hours (22.7% vs 2.6%; P < .001), and acute renal failure (12.1% vs 0.5%; P < .001). The EVAR group had a 30-day mortality rate of 2.6% in 1008 elective cases and 28.6% in 221 emergent cases. The OSR group had a 30-day mortality rate of 19.1% in 47 elective cases and 53.7% in 80 emergent cases. In the EVAR cohort, the 30-day mortality group had had a significantly greater incidence of dependent functional status (17% for those who had died vs 8% for those alive at 30 days; P = .004), ASA classification of ≥4 (76.4% vs 40.3%; P < .001), perioperative blood transfusion (57% vs 19%; P < .001), emergency surgery (71% vs 14%; P < .001), and longer operative times (150 vs 128 minutes; P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: Nonagenarians had an incrementally increased, but acceptable, risk of 30-day mortality with EVAR in elective and emergent cases compared with that reported for octogenarians and cohorts of patients not selected for age. We found greater mortality for patients with dependent status, a higher ASA classification, emergent repair, and OSR. These preoperative risk factors could help identify the best surgical candidates. Given these results, consideration for EVAR or OSR might be reasonable for highly selected patients, especially for elective patients with a larger abdominal aortic aneurysm diameter for whom the risk of rupture is higher.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 10684,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Mean age at surgery was 61.7 ± 12.3 years. Mean postoperative LOS was 3.08 ± 1.54 days. In multivariate analysis, American Society of Anesthesiologists class (odds ratio [OR] = 1.441, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.321-1.571), preoperative functional status (OR = 1.237, 95% CI 1.122-1.364), Oswestry Disability Index (OR = 1.010, 95% CI 1.004-1.016), and estimated blood loss (OR = 1.050, 95% CI 1.003-1.101) were independent risk factors for postoperative LOS ≥ 5 days. The final model had an area under the curve of 0.948 with good discrimination and was implemented in the form of an online calculator ( https://spine.shinyapps.io/TLIF_LOS/ ). CONCLUSION: The prediction tool derived can be useful for assessing likelihood of prolonged LOS in patients undergoing TLIF. With external validation, this calculator may ultimately assist healthcare providers in identifying patients at risk for prolonged hospitalization so preoperative interventions can be undertaken to reduce LOS, thus reducing resource utilization.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16812,Search update 2023-11-13,,

E.",Perioperative outcomes of the Geriatric Assessment and Medical Preoperative Screening (GrAMPS) program pilot for older hernia patients: does chronological age predict outcomes?,"BACKGROUND: The Geriatric Assessment and Medical Preoperative Screening (GrAMPS) program was an initial attempt to understand and to define the prevalence of age-related risk factors in older patients undergoing elective ventral hernia repair (VHR) or inguinal hernia repair (IHR). Preliminary analysis found significant rates of previously unrecognized objective cognitive dysfunction, multimorbidity and polypharmacy. We now examine whether chronological age as a sole risk factor can predict a patient's perioperative outcomes, and if traditional risk calculators that rely heavily on chronological age can accurately capture a patient's true risk. METHODS: This was a retrospective secondary analysis of the previously reported GrAMPS trial enrolling patients 60 years and older with a planned elective repair of a ventral or inguinal hernia. The rates of key postoperative outcomes were compared between various cohorts stratified by chronological age. Previously validated risk screening calculators [Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP)] were compared between cohorts. RESULTS: In total, 55 (78.6%) of the 70 patients enrolled in GrAMPS underwent operative intervention by May 2021, including 26 VHR and 29 IHRs. Cohorts stratified by chronological age had similar rates of key perioperative wound and age-related outcomes including readmissions, postoperative complications, non-home discharges, and length of stay. Additionally, while the commonly used risk calculators, CCI and NSQIP, consistently predicted worse outcomes for older hernia patients (stratified by both median age and age-tertiles), screening positive on these risk assessments were not actually predictive of a greater incidence of postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: Chronological age does not accurately predict worse adverse postoperative complications in older hernia patients. Additionally, traditional risk screening calculators that rely heavily on age to risk stratify may not accurately capture a patient's true surgical risk. Surgeons should continue to explore nuanced patient risk assessments that more accurately capture age-related risk factors to better individualize perioperative risk.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 8248,Search update 2023-11-13,,

We aimed to use the Kihon Check List (KCL) to assess multiple domains of frailty and to identify the characteristics of frailty in patients with hip or knee OA following total joint arthroplasty. Materials and Methods: This study included 136 ≥ 65-year-old patients (mean age: 73.0 years) who underwent total arthroplasty with end-stage hip and knee OA. We assessed frailty status, instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) according to the KCL, functional ambulatory index (FAI) and EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ5D), respectively, as well as the extent of pain preoperatively and at postoperative 6 months. Results: Using KCL, seventy-eight (57.4%) patients were frail preoperatively, but the prevalence significantly decreased to 52 patients (38.2%) at postoperative 6 months. Total arthroplasty intervention provided significant improvements in the total KCL scores, including the physical domain (P <.01), pain (P <.01), FAI scores (P <.01), and EQ5D (P <.01), but not the social domain. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified age at surgery (OR:.93, 95% CI:.86-.99) and preoperative FAI score (OR: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.03-1.19) as independent predictors of postoperative frailty. Conclusions: Total arthroplasty procedures on patients with hip and knee OA reduced their KCL score, but social aspects were less improved than physical aspects in the shortterm. Older age and preoperative lower IADL score can be useful for accurately estimating less improvement of frailty in the early postoperative phase. Our results suggest that long term follow-up of OA is needed to provide comprehensive interventions, including in social aspects, especially for patients with lower activity. © The Author(s) 2022.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16818,Search update 2023-11-13,,

However, the relationship between blood transfusion and POD is still controversial. The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors of POD, to evaluate the impact of blood transfusion in developing POD among people undergoing spinal fusion surgery, and to show the effectiveness of big data analytics using a clinical data warehouse (CDW). Materials and Methods: The medical data of patients who underwent spinal fusion surgery were obtained from the CDW of the five hospitals of Hallym University Medical Center. Clinical features, laboratory findings, perioperative variables, and medication history were compared between patients without POD and with POD. Results: 234 of 3967 patients (5.9%) developed POD. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the risk factors of POD were as follows: Parkinson's disease (OR 5.54, 95% CI 2.15-14.27; p < 0.001), intensive care unit (OR 3.45 95% CI 2.42-4.91; p < 0.001), anti-psychotics drug (OR 3.35 95% CI 1.91-5.89; p < 0.001), old age (≥70 years) (OR 3.08, 95% CI 2.14-4.43; p < 0.001), depression (OR 2.8 95% CI 1.27-6.2; p < 0.001).

Primary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of premium monovision (implantation of the trifocal diffractive Panoptix IOL in the non-dominant eye and the bifocal hybrid refractive-diffractive Restor IOL in the dominant eye), against bilateral myopic monovision (implantation of the monofocal SN60WF IOL targeting −0.50 D in the dominant eye and −1.25 D myopia in the non-dominant one), hybrid monovision (implantation of Panoptix in the non-dominant eye and SN60WF in the dominant eye) and bilateral trifocal implantation (with bilateral Panoptix implantation). Methods: This is a prospective, comparative, clinic-based trial. Cataract patients populated four study groups: Monovision Group (MoG), Multifocal Lens Group (MfG), Hybrid Monovision Group (HmG) and Premium Monovision Group (PmG). Binocular Uncorrected Distance Visual Acuity (UDVA), Uncorrected Reading Acuity and Critical Print Size at 60cm (UIRA, UICPS) and at 40cm (UNRA, UNCPS), contrast sensitivity, vision-related functional impairment, dysphotopsia symptoms and spectacle dependence were evaluated 6 months following the operation of the second eye. A mathematical model was constructed, which calculated the relative efficacy of each surgical intervention. Results: A total of 120 participants were recruited and populated equally the study groups. Significant improvement of preoperative UDVA was observed in all study groups. No significant differences could be detected in postoperative UDVA and UIRA (p = 0.24) among study groups, while significant differences were noticed in UICPS (p = 0.04), UNRA (p = 0.02) and UNCPS (p = 0.01). Dysphotopic phenomena (glare and shadows) were significantly more in the MfG arm followed by the PmG group (p = 0.04 and p = 0.02, respectively), while perceived difficulty and spectacle independence rates were significantly better in PmG group. PmG presented the best overall relative efficacy. Conclusion: All surgical techniques present satisfactory outcomes.

D., Winterer, G.",Functional Connectivity of the Supplementary and Presupplementary Motor Areas in Postoperative Transition Between Stages of Frailty,"BACKGROUND: Frailty is a multietiological geriatric syndrome of run-down physical reserves with high vulnerability to stressors. Transitions between physical robustness and frailty often occur in the context of medical interventions. Studies suggest that neurological disorders contribute to faster progression of frailty. In a previous cross-sectional study we found altered functional connectivity of supplementary motor area (SMA) in (pre)frail compared to robust patients. We analyzed functional connectivity of the SMA and presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA) in patients with postoperative transitions between physical robustness and stages of frailty. METHODS: We investigated 120 cognitively healthy patients (49.2% robust, 47.5% prefrail, 3.3% frail, 37.5% female, median age 71 [65-87] years) undergoing elective surgery from the BioCog project, a multicentric prospective cohort study on postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction. Assessments took place 14 days before and 3 months after surgery, comprising assessments of a modified frailty phenotype according to Fried and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T. The associations between functional connectivity of the SMA and pre-SMA networks, preoperative frailty stages, and postoperative transitions were examined using mixed linear effects models. RESULTS: Nineteen patients showed physical improvement after surgery, 24 patients progressed to (pre)frailty and in 77 patients no transition was observed. At follow-up, 57 (47.5%) patients were robust, 52 (43.3%) prefrail, and 11 (9.2%) frail. Lower functional connectivity in the pre-SMA network was associated with more unfavorable postoperative transition types. An exploratory analysis suggested that the association was restricted to patients who were prefrail at baseline. There was no association of transition type with SMA functional connectivity in the primary analysis. In an exploratory analysis, transition from prefrailty to robustness was associated with higher functional connectivity and progression in robust patients was associated with higher SMA network segregation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings implicate that dysfunctions of cortical networks involved in higher cognitive control of motion are associated with postoperative transitions between frailty stages. The pre-SMA may be a target for neurofeedback or brain stimulation in approaches to prevent frailty.

M.",Comparison of Electronic Frailty Metrics for Prediction of Adverse Outcomes of Abdominal Surgery,"IMPORTANCE: Electronic frailty metrics have been developed for automated frailty assessment and include the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS), the Electronic Frailty Index (eFI), the 5-Factor Modified Frailty Index (mFI-5), and the Risk Analysis Index (RAI). Despite substantial differences in their construction, these 4 electronic frailty metrics have not been rigorously compared within a surgical population. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the associations between 4 electronic frailty metrics and to measure their predictive value for adverse surgical outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study used electronic health record data from patients who underwent abdominal surgery from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2020, at 20 medical centers within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). Participants included adults older than 50 years who underwent abdominal surgical procedures at KPNC from 2010 to 2020 that were sampled for reporting to the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Pearson correlation coefficients between electronic frailty metrics and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of univariate models and multivariate preoperative risk models for 30-day mortality, readmission, and morbidity, which was defined as a composite of mortality and major postoperative complications. RESULTS: Within the cohort of 37 186 patients, mean (SD) age, 67.9 (female, 19 127 [51.4%]), correlations between pairs of metrics ranged from 0.19 (95% CI, 0.18- 0.20) for mFI-5 and RAI 0.69 (95% CI, 0.68-0.70). Only 1085 of 37 186 (2.9%) were classified as frail based on all 4 metrics. In univariate models for morbidity, HFRS demonstrated higher predictive discrimination (AUROC, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.70-0.72) than eFI (AUROC, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.63-0.65), mFI-5 (AUROC, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.57-0.59), and RAI (AUROC, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.57-0.58). The predictive discrimination of multivariate models with age, sex, comorbidity burden, and procedure characteristics for all 3 adverse surgical outcomes improved by including HFRS into the models. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, the 4 electronic frailty metrics demonstrated heterogeneous correlation and classified distinct groups of surgical patients as frail.

Lidocaine patches have shown efficacy in reducing pain in other surgical specialties and mixed results in orthopedic trials. We sought to determine the effectiveness of nonprescription lidocaine patches in reducing postoperative pain after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair Methods: Patients undergoing primary arthroscopic rotator cuff repair were recruited from 3 surgeons at a single institution. All patients of each surgeon were randomized to a lidocaine patch or control group, with crossover occurring at the midpoint. Experimental group patients received 26 4% lidocaine gel-patches. They were provided written and visual instructions to begin wearing the lidocaine patches during daytime on postoperative day (POD) 2. They were to be switched every 8 hours and removed overnight. Control group patients received normal standard of care but did not receive a placebo control. Exclusion criteria included workmen's compensation claims, age <18 years, history of myocardial infarction, and history of lidocaine or adhesive allergies. The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons shoulder survey was completed preoperatively and 2-, 6-weeks, 3-, 4.5-, and 6-months postoperatively. A 14-day visual analog scale pain and medication log was completed three times daily following repair. All patients received interscalene nerve block with bupivacaine and general anesthesia. Results: 80 (40 control, 40 lidocaine) patients were enrolled, with 53 completing follow-up. Groups were demographically similar in age (P = .22), gender (P = .20), and body mass index (P = .77). They were similar in tear pattern (P = .95), concomitant acromioplasty (P = .44), concomitant biceps tenodesis (P = .07), and number of anchors used (P = .25). There was no difference in American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores at any time points (range P = .28-P = .97). Reported 14-day pain logs were not different between study groups at any time points (range P = .07-P = .99). There was no difference in opioid consumption in the first 14 days after surgery (P = .38). The lidocaine group reported less satisfaction with their pain management beginning in the evening of POD 2 (P = .05). This continued until the afternoon of POD 8 (P = .03).

Given this premise, we evaluate the effects of frailty on post-appendectomy outcomes using a national in-hospital registry. METHODS: 2011-2017 National Inpatient Sample was used to isolate inpatient appendectomy cases; the population as stratified using Johns Hopkins ACG clinical frailty, expressed as either binary or ternary (prefrailty, frailty, and without frailty) indicators. The controls were matched to frailty-present groups using propensity score matching and compared to various endpoints, including mortality, length of stay (LOS), hospitalization costs, and postoperative complications. RESULTS: Post-match, there were 11,758 with and without frailty per binary; and 1236 frail, 10,522 pre-frail with respective equal number controls per ternary indicator. Using binary term, frail patients had higher mortality (4.22 vs 1.49% OR 2.92 95%CI 2.45-3.47), LOS (14.3 vs 5.35d p < 0.001), and costs ($160,700 vs $64,141 p < 0.001). In multivariate, frail patients had higher mortality (aOR 2.77 95%CI 2.32-3.31), as well as higher rates of postoperative complications. Using ternary term, frail patients had higher mortality (5.02 vs 2.27% OR 2.28 95%CI 1.45-3.59), LOS (18.9 vs 5.66 day p < 0.001) and costs ($200,517 vs $66,193 p < 0.001). In multivariate, frail patients had higher mortality (aOR 2.16 95%CI 1.35-3.43) and complications. Those with pre-frailty had higher mortality (4.12 vs 1.47% OR 2.88 95%CI 2.39-3.46), LOS (13.8 vs 5.34 day p < 0.001) and costs ($156,022 vs $63,772 p < 0.001). In multivariate, pre-frailty patients had higher mortality (aOR 2.79 95%CI 2.31-3.37) and complications. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty and prefrailty (using the ternary indicator) are associated with increased postoperative mortality and complication in patients who undergo appendectomy; given this finding, it is imperative that these vulnerable patients are identified early in the preoperative phase and are provided risk-modifying measures to ameliorate risks and optimize outcomes.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 9731,Search update 2023-11-13,,

However whether sarcopenia assessment can reclassify an individual patient's risk, which is estimated by Society of Thoracic Surgeons-predicted risk of mortality scores in patients who undergo surgical aortic valve replacement, is unclear. METHODS: This retrospective, single-center, cohort study comprised 874 patients aged ≥65 years who underwent surgical aortic valve replacement between 2009 and 2016. Total skeletal muscle area was calculated using height squared (cm(2)/m(2)) and was measured by preoperative computed tomography at the third lumbar vertebra inferior border using machine learning-based analysis. Sex-specific Z-scores were calculated, and patients in the lowest Z-score tertile were considered to have sarcopenia. The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality, and secondary endpoints were in-hospital events, 1-year mortality, and long-term mortality. RESULTS: Thirty-day mortality, 30-day in-hospital events, and 1-year mortality rates were 4.7%, 17.6%, and 8.0%, respectively. As the Z-score decreased, the odds of an early adverse event showed a stepwise increase. Sarcopenia was independently associated with higher 30-day mortality, 30-day in-hospital events, and 1-year mortality. Reclassification analyses showed improvements in the ability to predict early adverse events after adding the Z-scores over and above The Society of Thoracic Surgeons-predicted risk of mortality scores (all P < .005). CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenic patients had significantly higher risks of early adverse events and long-term mortality after undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement than nonsarcopenic patients.

A recent study attempted to predict preoperative frailty risk using only diagnostic and surgical codes that can be extracted from the electronic medical records system. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to validate whether the prediction model of preoperative frailty risk presented in the previous study is well applied to other medical hospitals' data. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study including 1,557 patients (≥75 years old) who were admitted to a single institution for emergency operations between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2019, for study analysis. The Charlson comorbidity index, Hospital Frailty Risk Score, and the recently developed Operation Frailty Risk Score (OFRS) were calculated using the patient's diagnostic and operation codes. The predictive performances of these calculated risk scores and the American Society of Anesthesiologists-Physical Status classification for postoperative 90-day mortality were compared by using the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. FINDINGS: The predictive performance of the OFRS, Charlson comorbidity index, American Society of Anesthesiologists-Physical Status, and Hospital Frailty Risk Score for postoperative 90-day mortality was 0.81, 0.630, 0.699, and 0.549 on a c-statistics basis, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The OFRS using diagnostic and operation codes may show the best predictive performance for 90-day mortality compared to other risk scores, and it can be the clinically applicable model to evaluate the preoperative frailty risk in elderly patients undergoing emergency surgery.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 11266,Search update 2023-11-13,,

P., Pogliacomi, F., Sabbatini, M.",Delirium risk factors analysis post proximal femur fracture surgery in elderly,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: The increase in the average-age and in the percentage of elderly people implies an exponential increase in fractures of the proximal femur. A common consequence of hip fracture in elderly patients is delirium, characterized by cognitive confusion or a lethargic-type condition. Predisposing factors have been identified, but risk factors assessment useful for managing clinical intervention, has not received unanimous consent. This work aims to identify the potential risk factors for delirium in the elderly operated for hip fracture. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, we included 83 patients aged ≥65 years. Patients undergoing osteosynthesis of the femur and hip replacement for fractures were included. Patients already delusional in the pre-operative period were excluded. At the time, deadlines T0 (pre-operative), and T1,T3,T7 post-operative day, delirium, hematic parameters, blood transfusions, were assessed. RESULTS: Level of delirium was assessed obtaining 80% not delusional and 20% delusional. Glycemia and hemoglobin were not found to be risk factors, although they are known to influence cognitive status; we hypothesize they should be considered predisposing factors. Comorbidities such as atrial fibrillation and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease were found associated with delirium. The most advanced age, anxiolytic drugs, the use of benzodiazepine as anaesthetic, the time surgical waiting, were found significantly associated with delirium. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, findings of this prospective observational study showed that environmental and metabolic risk factors might contribute to make elderly susceptible to develop postoperative delirium following hip surgery.

METHODS: The primary aim of this retrospective observational quality improvement project was to establish the prevalence of burst suppression during spine instrumentation surgery with TIVA. The secondary outcome was the incidence of postoperative delirium. RESULTS: One hundred twelve consecutive patients, aged between 20 and 88 years, underwent spinal instrumentation surgery. Seventy-eight (69.6%) patients experienced inadvertent burst suppression; the maximal degree of burst suppression ratio was 20% to 100%. Median (interquartile range [IQR]) time spent in burst suppression was 44 (77) minutes, and burst suppression was present for 22% (range: 2% to 93%) of the monitoring period. Average (±SD) propofol dose was lower in patients with burst suppression (87±19 vs. 93±15 µg/kg/min, P=0.04). Ten (8.9%) patients experienced postoperative delirium. Intraoperative burst suppression was more prevalent in those that experienced delirium (100% vs. 66.7%, P=0.03, relative risk: 1.5, 95% confidence interval: 1.3-1.7). The proportion of the monitoring period spent in maximal burst suppression (15.3 [25.9]% vs.11.7 [21.7]%) was similar between those that did, and did not, experience delirium. CONCLUSIONS: High rates and prolonged periods of inadvertent burst suppression may be prevalent during spine instrumentation surgery with TIVA. Our findings suggest that usage of electroencephalography alone is incomplete without prompt interpretation and intervention, mandating close communication between neuromonitoring and anesthesia teams. The dose-response relationship between burst suppression, total time spent in maximal burst suppression, and their association with delirium warrants further evaluation.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16984,Search update 2023-11-13,,

L., Herbet, G., Ng, S., Moritz-Gasser, S., Duffau, H.","Cognitive preservation following awake mapping-based neurosurgery for low-grade gliomas: A longitudinal, within-patient design study","Background: Awake surgery with intraoperative electrical mapping emerged as a gold-standard approach in newly diagnosed diffuse low-grade glioma (DLGG) to optimize the extent of resection (EOR) while sparing critical brain structures. However, no study has assessed to what extent cognitive recovery occurs following awake mapping-guided neurosurgery in a large, longitudinal, and homogeneous series of DLGG. Methods: A longitudinal study on the cognitive status of 157 DLGG patients was performed. Neuropsychological assessments were done before and three months after awake mapping-based surgery. Z-scores and variations of Z-scores were computed to determine the number of patients with cognitive deficit(s) or decline. Clinical, surgical, and histopathological variables were studied to investigate factors contributing to neurocognitive outcomes. Results: Eighty-seven patients (55.4%) had preoperative cognitive impairments. Statistical analysis between the preoperative (baseline) and postoperative assessments demonstrated a significant difference in three domains (Executive, Psychomotor Speed and Attention, Verbal Episodic Memory). Eighty-six percent of patients exhibited no postoperative cognitive decline, and among them, 10% exhibited cognitive improvement. The mean EOR was 92.3%±7.8%. The EOR, postoperative volume, and tumor lateralization had a significant association with cognitive decline. No patients demonstrated permanent postoperative neurologic deficits, but 5.8% did not resume their preoperative professional activities. The 5-year survival rate was 82.2%. Conclusions: This is the largest series ever reported with systematic longitudinal neuropsychological assessment. 86% of patients demonstrated no cognitive decline despite large resections and only 5.8% did not return to work. This work supports the practice of awake surgery with cognitive mapping as safe and effective in DLGG patients. © 2021 The Author(s).

A., Issa, M., Kiening, K., Ishak, B., Unterberg, A. W.",Spinal Meningioma Surgery in Octogenarians: Functional Outcomes and Complications over a 2-Year Follow-Up Period,"Background and Objectives: Population aging in industrial nations has led to an increased prevalence of benign spinal tumors, such as spinal meningiomas (SMs), in the elderly. The leading symptom of SM is local pain, and the diagnosis is confirmed after acute neurological decline. However, little is known about the optimal treatment for this frail patient group. Therefore, this study sought to assess the clinical outcome, morbidity, and mortality of octogenarians with SMs and progressive neurological decline undergoing surgery and to determine potential risk factors for complications. Materials and Methods: Electronic medical records dated between September 2005 and December 2020 from a single institution were retrieved. Data on patient demographics, neurological conditions, functional status, degree of disability, surgical characteristics, complications, hospital course, and 90-day mortality were collected. Results: Thirty patients aged ≥80 years who were diagnosed with SMs underwent posterior decompression via laminectomy and microsurgical tumor resection. The patients presented with a poor baseline history (mean CCI 8.9 ± 1.6 points). Almost all SMs were located in the thoracic spine (n = 25; 83.3%). Progressive preoperative neurological decline was observed in 21/30 (n = 21; 70%) patients with McCormick Scores (mMCS) ≥3, and their mean motor score (MS) was 85.9 ± 12.3. in the in-hospital and 90-day mortality rates were 6.7% and 10.0%, respectively. The MS (93.6 ± 8.3) and mMCS (1.8 ± 0.9) improved significantly postoperatively (p < 0.05). The unique risk factor for complications was the severity of comorbidities. Conclusions: Decompressive laminectomy and tumor removal in octogenarians with progressive neurological decline improved patient functional outcomes at discharge. Surgery seems to be the “state of the art” treatment for symptomatic SMs in elderly patients, even those with poor preoperative clinical and neurologic conditions, whenever there is an acceptable risk from an anesthesiological point of view.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16840,Search update 2023-11-13,,

This study was designed to analyze the association between composite risk index, an accumulation of preoperative frailty deficits, and the risk of postoperative complications in older patients recovering from elective digestive tract surgery. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. Baseline and perioperative data of older patients (age ≥ 65 years) who underwent elective digestive tract surgery from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2018 were collected. The severity of frailty was assessed with the composite risk index, a composite of frailty deficits including modified frailty index. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of postoperative complications during hospital stay. The association between the composite risk index and the risk of postoperative complications was assessed with a multivariable logistic regression model. RESULTS: A total of 923 patients were included. Of these, 27.8% (257) developed postoperative complications. Four frailty deficits, i.e., modified frailty index ≥0.27, malnutrition, hemoglobin < 90 g/L, and albumin ≤30 g/L, were combined to generate a composite risk index. Multivariable analysis showed that, when compared with patients with composite risk index of 0, the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) were 2.408 (1.714-3.383, P <  0.001) for those with a composite risk index of 1, 3.235 (1.985-5.272, P <  0.001) for those with a composite risk index of 2, and 9.227 (3.568-23.86, P <  0.001) for those with composite risk index of 3 or above. The area under receiver-operator characteristic curve to predict postoperative complications was 0.653 (95% confidence interval 0.613-0.694, P <  0.001) for composite risk index compared with 0.622 (0.581-0.663, P <  0.001) for modified frailty index.

This study aimed to clarify the association between the severity of preoperative functional impairment and the composite postoperative outcome of major morbidity and mortality in older patients undergoing digestive tract surgery. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. We collected perioperative data of older patients (age ≥ 65 years) who underwent digestive tract surgery in our institution. The severity of functional impairment was assessed using the Barthel Index scale before surgery. The major morbidity and mortality were defined as Clavien-Dindo grade III or greater postoperative complications during hospital stay. The association between the severity of functional impairment and the major morbidity and mortality was assessed using a multivariable logistic regression model. RESULTS: 131 of 1076 patients (12.2%) developed major morbidity and mortality. After controlling for confounding factors, high Barthel Index scores were correlated with decreased risk of major morbidity and mortality (OR 0.986, 95% CI 0.976-0.997, P = 0.011); preoperative severe (OR 2.862, 95% CI 1.172-6.989, P = 0.021), but not mild or moderate (OR 1.019, 95% CI 0.602-1.726, P = 0.943) functional impairment was independently associated with an increased risk of major morbidity and mortality, when compared with independent functional status.

However, compromised general health and poor oral hygiene habits at earlier ages resulted in poor status of preserved teeth. Therefore, tooth extraction is required in many aged people. More knowledge is needed because there are many risk factors during the surgery in frail aged adults. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cardiovascular response of such a population during tooth extraction and analyze risk factors to provide clinical guidance. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on aged patients with systemic diseases who underwent tooth extraction. Data regarding demographic profiles and cardiovascular parameters of heart rate and blood pressure were collected preoperative, when local anesthesia was administered, at the beginning of tooth extraction, 5 min after tooth extraction, and postoperative. The effects of risk factors, including age, sex, and systemic diseases on these parameters were analyzed with a multilevel model. RESULTS: Heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of aged patients increased significantly when performing local anesthesia and tooth extraction. During the operation, the older patients (β = 2.011, P = 0.005) and the diabetics (β = 3.902, P < 0.0001) were associated with higher SBP, while those with more tooth extractions exhibited higher HR (β = 0.893, P = 0.007). Women patients showed both significantly elevated HR (β = 1.687, P < 0.0001) and SBP (β = 2.268, P < 0.0001). However, for coronary artery disease patients, HR (β = -2.747, P < 0.0001) and blood pressure [SBP (β = -4.094, P < 0.0001) and DBP (β = -0.87, P = 0.016)] were markedly lower than those of patients without a diagnosis of coronary artery disease. CONCLUSION: Cardiovascular response of aged outpatients with systemic diseases during tooth extraction is quite significant. Age, sex, systemic diseases, and the number of tooth extraction could be risk factors closely associated with cardiovascular response.

The effects of low-dose esketamine on haemodynamics and postoperative quality of recovery in elderly patients have not been evaluated. To evaluate whether low-dose esketamine can be safely used for anaesthesia induction in the elderly. METHODS: Eighty elderly patients were selected for unilateral total knee replacement under general anaesthesia from February 2021 to August 2021. Patients were randomly divided into two groups (n = 40): control group (C group) and esketamine group (K group). During induction of anaesthesia, the control group was intravenously injected with normal saline of equal volume, and the esketamine group was intravenously injected with 0.2-mg/kg esketamine. Both groups were induced by etomidate, sufentanil and rocuronium and maintained by combined intravenous and inhaled anaesthesia during operation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: HR, SBP, DBP, MAP and BIS values were recorded before induction of anaesthesia (T(0) ), immediately before endotracheal intubation (T(1) ), 1min(T(2) ) and 5min(T(3) ) after endotracheal intubation, surgical skin incision (T(4) ), 1min(T(5) ) and 5min(T(6) ) after surgical skin incision. RESULTS: Compared with the C group, SBP, DBP, MAP, HR and BIS of the K group were significantly higher at T(1) -T(3) (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in SBP, DBP, MAP, HR and BIS between the two groups at T(4) -T(6) (p > 0.05). Compared with T(0) , SBP, MAP and BIS values of the two groups at T(1) -T(6) were decreased (p < 0.05). DBP of the K group at T(2) was not significantly different from DBP at T(0) (p < 0.05), but DBP of the C group decreased from T(1) to T(6) (p < 0.05). Compared with T(0) , HR in both groups decreased at T(1) , T(3) , T(4) , T(5) and T(6) (p < 0.05).

OBJECTIVE: To investigate, in older adults undergoing surgical repair for hip fracture, the effects of regional anesthesia on the incidence of postoperative delirium compared with general anesthesia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized, allocation-concealed, open-label, multicenter clinical trial of 950 patients, aged 65 years and older, with or without preexisting dementia, and a fragility hip fracture requiring surgical repair from 9 university teaching hospitals in Southeastern China. Participants were enrolled between October 2014 and September 2018; 30-day follow-up ended November 2018. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to receive either regional anesthesia (spinal, epidural, or both techniques combined with no sedation; n = 476) or general anesthesia (intravenous, inhalational, or combined anesthetic agents; n = 474). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome was incidence of delirium during the first 7 postoperative days. Secondary outcomes analyzed in this article include delirium severity, duration, and subtype; postoperative pain score; length of hospitalization; 30-day all-cause mortality; and complications. RESULTS: Among 950 randomized patients (mean age, 76.5 years; 247 [26.8%] male), 941 were evaluable for the primary outcome (6 canceled surgery and 3 withdrew consent). Postoperative delirium occurred in 29 (6.2%) in the regional anesthesia group vs 24 (5.1%) in the general anesthesia group (unadjusted risk difference [RD], 1.1%; 95% CI, -1.7% to 3.8%; P = .48; unadjusted relative risk [RR], 1.2 [95% CI, 0.7 to 2.0]; P = .57]). Mean severity score of delirium was 23.0 vs 24.1, respectively (unadjusted difference, -1.1; 95% CI, -4.6 to 3.1). A single delirium episode occurred in 16 (3.4%) vs 10 (2.1%) (unadjusted RD, 1.1%; 95% CI, -1.7% to 3.9%; RR, 1.6 [95% CI, 0.7 to 3.5]). Hypoactive subtype in 11 (37.9%) vs 5 (20.8%) (RD, 11.5; 95% CI, -11.0% to 35.7%; RR, 2.2 [95% CI, 0.8 to 6.3]). Median worst pain score was 0 (IQR, 0 to 20) vs 0 (IQR, 0 to 10) (difference 0; 95% CI, 0 to 0). Median length of hospitalization was 7 days (IQR, 5 to 10) vs 7 days (IQR, 6 to 10) (difference 0; 95% CI, 0 to 0). Death occurred in 8 (1.7%) vs 4 (0.9%) (unadjusted RD, -0.8%; 95% CI, -2.2% to 0.7%; RR, 2.0 [95% CI, 0.6 to 6.5]). Adverse events were reported in 106 episodes in the regional anesthesia group and 102 in the general anesthesia group; the most frequently reported adverse events were nausea and vomiting (47 [44.3%] vs 34 [33.3%]) and postoperative hypotension (13 [12.3%] vs 10 [9.8%]).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Elderly patients with surgery for lower limb fracture under non-general anaesthesia were included. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and platelet-to-white cell ratio (PWR), which were most recently measured preceding surgery and measured within 24h after surgery, were calculated. Delirium was measured with Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) once daily from preoperative day 1 to postoperative day 3 or hospital discharge. RESULTS: The incidence of POD was 32.6% (60/184). Between patients with and those without POD, there were significant differences in preoperative hematological biomarkers (neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, NLR and PWR) and postoperative hematological biomarkers (white cell count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, NLR, PLR and PWR). More obvious changes before and after operation for NLR, PLR and C-reactive protein (CRP) were found in patients with POD. Multivariate logistic regression showed that benzodiazepines (OR, 7.912; 95% CI, 1.884-33.230; p = 0.005), change of CRP (OR, 1.017; 95% CI, 1.007-1.027; p = 0.001) and postoperative NLR (OR, 1.358; 95% CI, 1.012-1.823; p = 0.041) were associated with POD. When the changes of NLR, PLR and PWR entered multivariate logistic regression, older age (OR, 1.073; 95% CI, 1.001-1.149; p = 0.046), benzodiazepines (OR, 6.811; 95% CI, 1.652-28.081; p = 0.008), greater change of CRP (OR, 1.015; 95% CI, 1.006-1.023; p = 0.001) and greater change of NLR (OR, 1.266; 95% CI, 1.035-1.549; p = 0.022) were associated with increased risk of POD. Postoperative NLR had high accuracy to predict POD with area under curve (AUC) of 0.790 (95% CI 0.708 to 0.872). CONCLUSION: Age, benzodiazepines, postoperative NLR, change of NLR and change of CRP were independent predictable markers for POD in elderly patients undergoing surgery for lower limb fracture under non-general anaesthesia. Early postoperative NLR may help to recognize POD as soon as possible.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 7883,Search update 2023-11-13,,

The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive ability of preoperative plasma biomarkers along with cerebral oxygen saturation (SctO2) for the incidence of PND in elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: A total of 210 patients aged 65–80 years undergoing spinal surgery were randomly assigned to three groups (n = 70 each): propofol, sevoflurane, and propofol/sevoflurane as anesthesia maintenance protocols. Propofol was administrated target-controlled infusion of 4 μg/ml (group P), the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of inhalation anesthetic sevoflurane was 1.3 (group S), and propofol was injected with a target-controlled plasma concentration of 1.2 μg/ml, accompanied by sevoflurane inhalation 0.7 MAC (group PS). Cognitive function was evaluated 1 day preoperatively and on the 7th day postoperatively. Preoperative levels of amyloidβ-40 (Aβ-40), Aβ-42, total tau protein (T-tau), phosphorylated tau protein (P-tau), and triggering receptors on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2) were investigated. SctO2 was monitored intraoperatively. Results: Aβ-42 had the strongest significant correlation with preoperative MoCA score. The value of Aβ-42 associated with a high risk of PND was 28.34 pg/ml, and the area under the curve (AUC) was predicted to be 0.711. When the preoperative level of Aβ-42 was 28.34 pg/ml, SctO2max% was 9.92%. The AUC was predicted to be 0.872, and the sensitivity and specificity were 0.833 and 0.841, respectively. Conclusion: Under the conditions of preoperative Aβ-42 less than 28.34 pg/ml, the intraoperative fluctuation range of cerebral oxygen saturation should be maintained within 9.92% to reduce the occurrence of PND in geriatric patients with MCI.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16726,Search update 2023-11-13,,

The aim of the current study was to prospectively examine postoperative changes in nutritional and functional status of patients undergoing surgery for gastric, esophageal, and gastroesophageal junction cancer. METHODS: Participants were prospectively recruited from September 2015 to September 2019. The assessment of malnutrition was based on the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment tool. The functional assessment included the evaluation of muscle strength and physical performance, while muscle mass assessment was based on Skeletal Muscle Mass Index (SMI) derived from the analysis of computed tomography scans. The follow up of patients was scheduled at six months postoperatively. RESULTS: A total of 98 patients were analyzed. Mean patient age was 60.79 ± 10.19 years and 80.6% were males. The mean unintentional weight loss at 6 months was 11.7 ± 8.0%. Patients who underwent McKeown esophagectomy reported the greatest weight loss postoperatively (16.2 ± 9.6%), whereas the lowest rate of weight loss was observed in patients who underwent partial gastrectomy (5.6 ± 6.7%). The rate of severe malnutrition declined at six months postoperatively (39.7% vs 27%). Muscle strength and physical performance were significantly deteriorated at 6 months postoperatively, except for the group of partial gastrectomy, while SMI significantly decreased in all groups of patients except for McKewon esophagectomy group. Finally, the prevalence of low muscle mass increased significantly from 43.5% in the preoperative period to 66.7% at the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed a significant deterioration in gastroesophageal cancer patient nutritional and functional status at six months postoperatively. The high prevalence of malnutrition and low muscle mass requires systematic follow-up and multidirectional monitoring in order to ensure the successful rehabilitation of these patients.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 10025,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Heart and Lung.  2022. 56:1-7","Lim, A., Choi, M., Jang, Y., Lee, H.",Preoperative frailty based on laboratory data and postoperative health outcomes in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery,"Background: Frailty is associated with adverse surgical outcomes. Patients with cardiovascular diseases have many risk factors of frailty; thus, preoperative frailty evaluation is necessary to predict adverse outcomes after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Laboratory data based-frailty assessments are objective and not time-consuming, addressing the need for an accurate but simple frailty screening for patients awaiting CABG surgery. Objectives: This retrospective study aimed to determine the association between laboratory based-frailty and patient health outcomes after CABG surgery. Methods: We evaluated 896 patients who underwent on-pump or off-pump CABG surgery between August 1, 2015 and July 31, 2020 at a tertiary hospital. The frailty index-laboratory (FI-LAB), which comprises 32 laboratory parameters and vital signs, was used for frailty assessment. Results: The patients were divided into three groups according to their preoperative FI-LAB level as low (FI-LAB <0.25, 23.0%), moderate (FI-LAB ≥0.25 to ≤0.4, 54.9%), and high (FI-LAB>0.4, 22.1%) frailty groups. In the confounder-adjusted analysis, the lengths of hospital stay and intensive care unit stay were longer by 2.20 days (p=.023) and by 0.89 days (p=.009), respectively, in the high frailty group than those in the low frailty group. The odds ratio for 30-day readmission was also 2.58 times higher in the high frailty group than that in the low frailty group. Conclusion: A high preoperative FI-LAB score indicates increasing risks of adverse postoperative outcomes among CABG surgery patients. FI-LAB has potential strengths to capture the need for a more thorough frailty assessment for cardiac surgery patients.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16416,Search update 2023-11-13,,

A., Ogan, K.",Low free testosterone is associated with increased mortality in frail surgical patients,"Background: Preoperative frailty has been associated with adverse postoperative outcomes. Additionally, low testosterone has been associated with physical frailty and cognitive decline. However, the impact of simultaneous frailty and low testosterone on surgical outcomes is understudied. Methods: Preoperative frailty status and testosterone levels were obtained in patients undergoing a diverse range of surgical procedures. Preoperative frailty was evaluated independently and in combination with testosterone through the creation of composite risk groups. Relationships between preoperative frailty and composite risk groups with overall survival were determined using Kaplan–Meier and logistic regression analyses. Bivariate analysis was used to determine the associations between frailty and testosterone status on postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, and readmission rates. Results: Median age of the cohort was 63 years, and the median follow-up time was 105 weeks. Thirty-one patients (23%) were frail, and 36 (27%) had low free testosterone. Bivariate analysis demonstrated a statistically significant relationship between preoperative frailty and overall survival (P =.044). In multivariate analysis, coexisting frailty and low free testosterone were significantly associated with decreased overall survival (hazard ratio 4.93, 95% confidence interval, 1.68–14.46, P =.004). Conclusion: We observed preoperative frailty, both independently and in combination with low free testosterone levels, to be significantly associated with decreased overall survival across various surgical procedures. Personalizing the surgical risk assessment through the incorporation of preoperative frailty and testosterone status may serve to improve the prognostication of patients undergoing major surgery.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16417,Search update 2023-11-13,,

General anesthesia has already been associated with the one-year post-operative neurocognitive disorder (PostO-NCD), specifically, a deficit in executive function, measured by the Trail Making Test B (TMT-B), but its long-term effects on cognitive function have not been investigated. We aimed to detect preO-NCD prevalence in patients scheduled for cardiac surgery and further investigate the possible role of previous general anesthesia (pGA) in general preoperative cognitive status [measured via the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)] and/or in executive functioning (measured via TMT-B). Methods: In this observational, prospective study, 151 adult patients scheduled for elective cardiac surgery underwent MoCA and TMT-B. Data on age, education, pGA, comorbidities, and laboratory results were collected. Results: We discovered a general cognitive function impairment of 79.5% and an executive function impairment of 22%. Aging is associated with an increased likelihood (OR 2.99, p = 0.047) and education with a decreased likelihood (OR 0.35, p = 0.0045) of general cognitive impairment, but only education was significantly associated with a decreased likelihood (OR 0.22, p = 0.021) of executive function impairment. While pGA did not significantly affect preO-NCD, a noteworthy interaction between aging and pGA was found, resulting in a synergistic effect, increasing the likelihood of executive function impairment (OR 9.740, p = 0.0174). Conclusion: We found a high prevalence of preO-NCD in patients scheduled for cardiac surgery. General cognitive function impairment is highly associated with advancing age (not pGA). However, older patients with at least one pGA appeared to be at an increased risk of preO-NCD, especially executive function impairment, suggesting that TMT-B should be associated with MoCA in the preoperative cognitive evaluation in this population.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 10855,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Neostigmine, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, can enhance the transmission of cholinergic transmitters in synaptic space, and play an important role in maintaining the normal level of cognition, attention and consciousness. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of neostigmine on POD and clinical prognosis. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind controlled trial was implemented in Qingdao Municipal Hospital Affiliated to Qingdao University. A total of 454 patients aged 40 to 90 years old accepted colon carcinoma surgery were enrolled between June 7, 2020, and June 7, 2021, with final follow-up on December 8, 2021. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups: the neostigmine group (group N) and the placebo group (group P), the patients in group N were injected with 0.04 mg/kg neostigmine and 0.02 mg/kg atropine intravenously. The primary endpoint was the incidence of POD, researchers evaluated the occurrence of POD by the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) twice daily (at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.) during the first 7 postoperative days, POD severity was assessed by the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS). The secondary endpoints were the extubating time, postanesthesia care unit (PACU) time, the incidence of various postoperative complications, length of hospital stays, and 6 months postoperative mortality. RESULTS: The incidence of POD was 20.20% (81/401), including 19.39% (38/196) in group N and 20.98% (43/205) in group P. There was no significant statistical significance in the incidence of POD between group N and group P (P > 0.05); Compared to group P, the extubating time and PACU time in group N were significantly reduced (P < 0.001), the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (POPCs) decreased significantly in group N (P < 0.05), while no significant differences were observed in postoperative hospital stay and mortality in 6 months between the two groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: For patients accepted colon carcinoma surgery, neostigmine did not significantly reduce the incidence of POD, postoperative mortality and postoperative hospital stay, while it indeed reduced the extubating time, PACU time and the incidence of POPCs.

METHODS: A blinded, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study was performed on 60 patients (age range 65-74 years) undergoing lobectomy by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (29 in the dexmedetomidine group; 31 in the placebo group). Dexmedetomidine group patients received dexmedetomidine, and placebo group patients received an equal volume of physiological saline 20 minutes before anesthesia induction. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment 1 day before surgery and on postoperative day (POD)1, POD3, and POD7. The regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO(2)) was monitored continuously by near-infrared spectroscopy before anesthesia. RESULTS: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was significantly different between the two groups on POD1 (dexmedetomidine 26.4  ±  0.73 vs. placebo 25.5 ± 0.96) and POD3 (dexmedetomidine 27.1 ± 0.79 vs. placebo 26.6 ± 0.80). Specifically, attention and orientation scores were increased in the dexmedetomidine group on POD1 and POD3. The rSO(2) was not significantly different between the dexmedetomidine and placebo groups. CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine given before induction of anesthesia could reduce the risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction and might not decrease rSO(2). Hence, dexmedetomidine could be employed in pulmonary surgical procedures, especially for older patients with a high risk of cognitive dysfunction.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16741,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Patients and Methods: This was a prospective double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial conducted in Cangzhou Central Hospital from December 2021 to March 2022. Patients aged 65 and older underwent oral and maxillofacial surgery under general anesthesia. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to dexmedetomidine or control group. Dexmedetomidine was injected intrave-nously from 10 min before induction of anesthesia to 30 min before the end of surgery in dexmedetomidine group, while patients in the control group were given normal saline at the same rate during the same time period. The primary measurement indicators were the incidence and duration of delirium in the first five days after surgery. The secondary measurement indicators were Visual Analogue Score (VAS) for the first 24 hours following surgery, subjective sleep quality score within 24 hours postoperatively and intraoperative adverse reactions. Results: One hundred and twenty patients were randomly assigned. Baseline characteristics were similar between two groups.

C.",Prehabilitative resistance exercise reduces neuroinflammation and improves mitochondrial health in aged mice with perioperative neurocognitive disorders,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction remains a significant problem in vulnerable groups such as the elderly. While experimental data regarding its possible pathogenic mechanisms accumulate, therapeutic options for this disorder are limited. In this study, we evaluated the neuroprotective effect of a period of preconditioning resistant training on aged mice undergoing abdominal surgery. Further, we examined the underlying mechanisms from the perspective of neuroinflammatory state and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. METHODS: 18-month-old C57BL/6N mice were trained for 5 weeks using a ladder-climbing protocol with progressively increasing weight loading. Preoperative baseline body parameters, cognitive performance and neuroinflammatory states were assessed and compared between sedentary and trained groups of 9-month-old and 18-month-old mice. To access the neuroprotective effect of resistance training on postoperative aged mice, both sedentary and trained mice were subjected to a laparotomy under 3% sevoflurane anesthesia. Cognitive performance on postoperative day 14, hippocampal neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction and synaptic plasticity were examined and compared during groups. RESULTS: 18-month-old mice have increased body weight, higher peripheral and central inflammatory status, reduction in muscle strength and cognitive performance compared with middle-aged 9-month-old mice, which were improved by resistance exercise. In the laparotomy group, prehabilitative resistant exercise improved cognitive performance and synaptic plasticity, reduced inflammatory factors and glial cells activation after surgery. Furthermore, resistance exercise activated hippocampal PGC-1α/BDNF/Akt/GSK-3β signaling and improved mitochondrial biogenesis, as well as ameliorated mitochondrial dynamics in postoperative-aged mice. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance exercise reduced risk factors for perioperative neurocognitive disorders such as increased body weight, elevated inflammatory markers, and pre-existing cognitive impairment. Accordantly, preoperative resistance exercise improved surgery-induced adverse effects including cognitive impairment, synaptic deficit and neuroinflammation, possibly by facilitate mitochondrial health through the PGC1-a/BDNF pathway.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 8981,Search update 2023-11-13,,

However, it remains uncertain whether the potential for adrenocortical suppression with etomidate may increase morbidity. OBJECTIVE: To test the primary hypothesis that etomidate vs propofol for anesthesia does not increase in-hospital morbidity after abdominal surgery in older patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter, parallel-group, noninferiority randomized clinical trial (Etomidate vs Propofol for In-hospital Complications [EPIC]) was conducted between August 15, 2017, and November 20, 2020, at 22 tertiary hospitals in China. Participants were aged 65 to 80 years and were scheduled for elective abdominal surgery. Patients and outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation. Data analysis followed a modified intention-to-treat principle. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either etomidate or propofol for general anesthesia by target-controlled infusion. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome was a composite of major in-hospital postoperative complications (with a noninferiority margin of 3%). Secondary outcomes included intraoperative hemodynamic measurements; postoperative adrenocortical hormone levels; self-reported postoperative pain, nausea, and vomiting; and mortality at postoperative months 6 and 12. RESULTS: A total of 1944 participants were randomized, of whom 1917 (98.6%) completed the trial. Patients were randomized to the etomidate group (n = 967; mean [SD] age, 70.3 [4.0] years; 578 men [59.8%]) or propofol group (n = 950; mean [SD] age, 70.6 [4.2] years; 533 men [56.1%]). The primary end point occurred in 90 of 967 patients (9.3%) in the etomidate group and 83 of 950 patients (8.7%) in the propofol group, which met the noninferiority criterion (risk difference [RD], 0.6%; 95% CI, -1.6% to 2.7%; P = .66). In the etomidate group, mean (SD) cortisol levels were lower at the end of surgery (4.8 [2.7] μg/dL vs 6.1 [3.4] μg/dL; P < .001), and mean (SD) aldosterone levels were lower at the end of surgery (0.13 [0.05] ng/dL vs 0.15 [0.07] ng/dL; P = .02) and on postoperative day 1 (0.14 [0.04] ng/dL vs 0.16 [0.06] ng/dL; P = .001) compared with the propofol group. No difference in mortality was observed between the etomidate and propofol groups at postoperative month 6 (2.2% vs 3.0%; RD, -0.8%; 95% CI, -2.2% to 0.7%) and 12 (3.3% vs 3.9%; RD, -0.6%; 95% CI, -2.3% to 1.0%). More patients had pneumonia in the etomidate group than in the propofol group (2.0% vs 0.3%; RD, 1.7%; 95% CI, 0.7% to 2.8%; P = .001). Results were consistent in the per-protocol population. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results of this trial showed that, compared with propofol, etomidate anesthesia did not increase overall major in-hospital morbidity after abdominal surgery in older patients, although it induced transient adrenocortical suppression.

It causes greater difficulty in recovery, longer hospital stays, and consequent delay in returning to work activities. Digital games have a potential neuromodulatory and rehabilitation effect. In this study, a digital game was used as a neuropsychological test to assess postoperative cognitive dysfunction, with preoperative patient performance as control. METHODS: It was a non-controlled study, with patients selected among candidates for elective non-cardiac surgery, evaluated in the pre- and postoperative periods. The digital game used has six phases developed to evaluate selective attention, alternating attention, visuoperception, inhibitory control, short-term memory, and long-term memory. The digital game takes about 25 minutes. Scores are the sum of correct answers in each cognitive domain. Statistical analysis compared these cognitive functions pre- and post-surgery using a generalized linear mixed model (ANCOVA). RESULTS: Sixty patients were evaluated, 40% male and 60% female, with a mean age of 52.7 ± 13.5 years. Except for visuoperception, a reduction in post-surgery scores was found in all phases of the digital game. CONCLUSION: The digital game was able to detect decline in several cognitive functions postoperatively. As its completion is faster than in conventional tests on paper, this digital game may be a potentially recommended tool for assessing patients, especially the elderly and in the early postoperative period.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 5465,Search update 2023-11-13,,

The intraoperative dosage of propofol in group H was lower than that in group L (P < 0.05). Compared with the L group, the plasma IL-6 and IL-10 concentrations in the H group were significantly increased at T2 (P < 0.05), and the plasma IL-10 concentration was significantly increased at T4 (P < 0.05). The plasma concentrations of IL-6 and IL-10 were higher in both groups at T2, T3 and T4 than at T1, while at T4, the concentration of TNF-α in group H was higher than at T1 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: When the BIS value of the depth of anesthesia is 45, the perioperative release of inflammatory factors in elderly patients with laparoscopic radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer is less than BIS 55, and does not affect the prognosis.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16854,Search update 2023-11-13,,

METHODS: Patients who have undergone total hip joint replacement and who were admitted to the hospital from August 1, 2017, to August 1, 2020, were included in this study. After initial screening, 327 out of 385 patients were selected and randomly assigned to either dexmedetomidine (0.1 μg/kg/h, n=163) or placebo (n=164) groups. The occurrence of delirium was examined twice a day for one week by using the Confusion Assessment Method. Furthermore, 30-day all-cause mortality, hospitalization duration and costs, and the presence of any postoperative complications were also evaluated. RESULTS: The postoperative delirium incidence was significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group compared to that in the placebo group (13.8 vs. 29.3%, p<0.01). The hospitalization duration (17.2±6.3 vs. 15.6±4.2, p=0.006) and cost (4.5±0.9 vs. 4.9±1.1, p=0.001) in the dexmedetomidine group were also lower than those in the placebo group. Meanwhile, no significant difference between the 30-day all-cause mortality of the two groups was observed (p=0.60). In terms of safety, no significant differences between the occurrence of hypotension and bradycardia were also observed. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that the dexmedetomidine medication can reduce the postoperative delirium incidence in older total hip joint replacement patients and can subsequently decrease the related hospitalization duration and cost of these patients.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16718,Search update 2023-11-13,,

The association between preoperative frailty and postoperative outcomes in patients with hip fractures is unclear. To address this issue, we performed a meta-analysis to determine the association of frailty with postoperative mortality, complications, and readmission in patients with hip fractures. Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and The Cochrane Library for cohort studies of frailty associated with postoperative adverse events in patients with hip fractures from inception to November 6, 2021. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate the quality of the included literature. Statistical analysis of meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3. Results: Twelve retrospective cohort studies and seven prospective cohort studies involving a total of 62,132 patients met the inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis. Compared with non-frail patients, the pooled results showed that frailty was associated with patient in-hospital mortality (relative risk [RR] = 2.93; 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 2.56–3.34), 30-day mortality (RR = 2.85, 95%CI: 1.67–4.85) and total complications (RR = 1.79, 95%CI: 1.50–2.15). Subgroup analysis showed that the type of study design and frailty assessment tool had no significant effect on the results. Sensitivity analysis showed that the polled results of frailty predicted one-year mortality and 30-day readmission was unstable. Conclusions: In this meta-analysis, we found that preoperative frailty may be associated with postoperative adverse events in patients with hip fractures, including in-hospital mortality, 30-day mortality, and postoperative complications.

Unfortunately, it has high rates of perioperative morbidity and mortality. One of the most important predictors of postoperative outcomes is frailty, while the majority of complications are diversion related. The aim of our study was to evaluate safety of extraperitoneal cystectomy with ureterocutaneostomy in patients considered as frail. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively collected data of frail patients who underwent extraperitoneal cystectomy with ureterocutaneostomy from October 2018 to August 2020 in a single center. We evaluated frailty by assessing patients' age, body mass index (BMI), nutritional status by Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool, overall health by RAI (Risk Analysis Index) and ASA (American Society of Anaesthesiologists) score, and laboratory analyses. We observed intraoperative outcomes and rates of perioperative (within 30 days) and early postoperative (within 90 days) complications (Clavien-Dindo classification). We defined extraperitoneal cystectomy with ureterocutaneostomy as safe if patients did not develop Clavien Dindo IIIb, or worse, complication. RESULTS: A total of 34 patients, 3 female and 31 male, were analyzed. The median age was 77, BMI 26, RAI 28, ASA 3 and the majority had preexisting renal insufficiency. Blood analyses revealed presence of severe preoperative hypoalbuminemia and anemia in half of our cohort. Intraoperative median blood loss was 250 cc, whilst operative time 245 min. During perioperative period 60% of our cohort developed Clavien Dindo II complication and during early postoperative period 32% of patients required readmission. One death occurred during early postoperative period (2.9%). After 12 months of follow-up, we observed stability of the renal function for most patients. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that extraperitoneal cystectomy with ureterocutaneostomy could be considered as a treatment option for elderly and/or frail patients.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16923,Search update 2023-11-13,,

T.","Non-emergent Conditions of the Ankle, Hindfoot, and Midfoot in Elderly Patients Are as Mobility Limiting as Congestive Heart Failure","BACKGROUND: Mobility limitations are well linked to increased morbidity and mortality. Older patients with chronic pathologies of the foot and ankle can suffer from significant mobility limitations; however, the magnitude of limitation experienced by this cohort is not well characterized. Conversely, the effects of congestive heart failure (CHF) on patient mobility are routinely assessed via the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification. New York Heart Association classification is determined by a patient's physical activity limitation and is strongly correlated to functional status. We hypothesized that non-emergent conditions of the foot and ankle would be as mobility limiting as CHF. METHODS: Life-Space Mobility Assessments (LSAs) were prospectively collected from orthopaedic patients at their preoperative visits and from CHF patients at a cardiology clinic. Patients over the age of 50 years were included in this study. Congestive heart failure patients NYHA class II or greater were included. The non-emergent foot and ankle cohort included Achilles tendonitis, ankle joint cartilage defects, ankle arthritis, subtalar arthritis, and midfoot arthritis. Patient demographics and LSA scores were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U and chi-squared tests. RESULTS: A total of 96 elderly, non-emergent foot and ankle operative patients and 45 CHF patients met inclusion criteria. All medical comorbidities, except smoking status, were significantly more prevalent in the CHF cohort. No statistical difference was observed between CHF and preoperative foot and ankle LSA scores (56.1 vs 62.4, P = .320). Life-Space Mobility Assessment scores in the foot and ankle cohort were significantly improved relative to CHF patients, at 6-month and 1-year postoperative visits (P = .028, P < .0001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Non-emergent ankle, hindfoot, and midfoot pathology is associated with similar mobility limitation to that of NYHA class II and III CHF. Older patients undergoing elective foot and ankle procedures exceeded the mobility of CHF patients at 6 months post-operation, and the mobility gains persisted at 1-year post-operation.

The objective of this exploratory study was to conduct a secondary analysis to identify whether there exist novel and reliable serum biomarkers for the prediction of POD. METHODS: A total of 131 adult patients (≥ 65 years) undergoing lower extremity orthopedic surgery with were enrolled in this study. Cognitive function was assessed preoperatively with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Delirium was diagnosed according to the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) criteria on preoperative day and postoperative days 1-3. The preoperative serum levels of a panel of 16 biochemical parameters were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients developed POD, with an incidence of 26.7%. Patients in POD group were older (P = 0.001) and had lower preoperative MMSE scores (P = 0.001). Preoperative serum levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2, P < 0.001), S100β (P < 0.001), glial fibrillary acidic protein (P < 0.001) and neurofilament light (P = 0.002) in POD group were significantly increased. Logistic regression analysis showed that advanced age (OR = 1.144, 95%CI: 1.008 ~ 1.298, P = 0.037), higher serum neurofilament light (OR = 1.003, 95%CI: 1.000 ~ 1.005, P = 0.036) and PGE2 (OR = 1.031, 95%CI: 1.018 ~ 1.044, P < 0.001) levels were associated with the development of POD. In addition, serum level of PGE2 yielded an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.897 to predict POD (P < 0.001), with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 83.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that higher preoperative serum PGE2 level might be a biomarker to predict the occurrence of POD in elderly patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgery.

However, single-agent adjuvant chemotherapy is a valid treatment option in other gastrointestinal malignancies, preferred for elderly and/or frail patients. The current study used a nationwide oncology database to assess the benefit of single-agent adjuvant chemotherapy, specifically in the elderly population. METHODS: Using the National Cancer Database (2004-2016) we identified 1953 individuals with non-metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma who underwent upfront D2 gastrectomy with pathologic stage ≥ T3 or Npos and free surgical margins, and had not received either preoperative chemotherapy or pre-/postoperative radiotherapy. We used IPTW analysis to compare overall survival between individuals receiving either single- or multi-agent adjuvant chemotherapy, or referred to observation alone. RESULTS: Individuals receiving single-agent chemotherapy had an overall survival benefit compared with observation alone, with an HR of 0.70 (95% CI 0.55-0.88, p < 0.001). Individuals over the age of 65 had an OS benefit with an HR of 0.61 (95% CI 0.46-0.82, p < 0.001). Comparing individuals over the age of 65 receiving single- vs. multi-agent chemotherapy, there was no overall survival difference with an HR of 0.87 (95% CI 0.64-1.18, p = 0.38). CONCLUSIONS: Single-agent adjuvant chemotherapy with a fluoropyrimidine in locally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma following D2 gastrectomy can improve overall survival in elderly patients.

We associate a sarcopenia biomarker measured radiographically from computed tomography (CT) of the neck to postoperative adverse events in patients with operable HNC. Patients and methods: A prospective cohort of treatment-naïve HNC patients undergoing surgery with microvascular reconstruction was performed. Cervical paraspinal skeletal muscle index (CPSMI) was calculated using preoperative CT neck imaging and adjusted for height and sex. Postoperative adverse events, including Clavien-Dindo Grade 3+ complications and fistula, were recorded within 30-days of the index surgery. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between CPSMI and postoperative complications. The modified frailty index (mFI) and Risk Assessment Index (RAI) were compared with CPSMI outcomes. Results: A total of 127 patients with mucosal HNC were included in the study. The mean age was 60.5 years, and 87 (68.5%) patients were male. Sixty Clavien-Dindo grade 3+ events occurred; 17 patients developed an oro/pharyngocutaneous fistula. Low CPSMI was independently associated with Clavien-Dindo Grade 3+ events (OR 2.80, 95% CI of 1.18–6.99) and fistula (OR of 6.10, 95% CI of 1.53–24.3) when adjusted for multiple factors.

The objective of this study was to ascertain which factors are most predictive of MPAEs in patients undergoing head and neck surgery. Methods: A cohort study was carried out based on data from patients registered in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) from 2006 to 2018. All patients undergoing non-ambulatory head and neck surgery based on Current Procedural Terminology codes were included. Perioperative factors were evaluated to predict MPAEs within 30-days of surgery. Age was classified as both a continuous and categorical variable. Retained factors were classified by attributable fraction and C-statistic. Multivariate regression and supervised machine learning models were used to quantify the contribution of age as a predictor of MPAEs. Results: A total of 43 701 operations were analyzed with 5106 (11.7%) MPAEs. The results of supervised machine learning indicated that prolonged surgeries, anemia, free tissue transfer, weight loss, wound classification, hypoalbuminemia, wound infection, tracheotomy (concurrent with index head and neck surgery), American Society of Anesthesia (ASA) class, and sex as most predictive of MPAEs. On multivariate regression, ASA class (21.3%), hypertension on medication (15.8%), prolonged operative time (15.3%), sex (13.1%), preoperative anemia (12.8%), and free tissue transfer (9%) had the largest attributable fractions associated with MPAEs. Age was independently associated with MPAEs with an attributable fraction ranging from 0.6% to 4.3% with poor predictive ability (C-statistic 0.60). Conclusion: Surgical, comorbid, and frailty-related factors were most predictive of short-term MPAEs following head and neck surgery.

To test the hypothesis that parathyroidectomy improves frailty, we conducted a prospective cohort comparison of frailty after parathyroid or thyroid surgery. METHODS: The Risk Analysis Index measuring frailty was prospectively administered to patients undergoing curative parathyroid exploration or total thyroidectomy. Risk Analysis Index results at the preoperative, postoperative, and last follow-up visits were assessed longitudinally. RESULTS: Compared to total thyroidectomy patients (n = 142), parathyroid exploration patients (n = 187) were older (P = .001), more often male (P = .05) and had longer surgical follow-up (P < .001).

Prehabilitation may improve outcomes after surgery for older people with frailty by addressing physical and physiologic deficits. The objective of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of home-based multimodal prehabilitation in decreasing patient-reported disability and postoperative complications in older people with frailty having major surgery. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a multicentre, randomised controlled trial of home-based prehabilitation versus standard care among consenting patients >60 years with frailty (Clinical Frailty Scale>4) having elective inpatient major non-cardiac, non-neurologic or non-orthopaedic surgery. Patients will be partially blinded; clinicians and outcome assessors will be fully blinded. The intervention consists of >3 weeks of prehabilitation (exercise (strength, aerobic and stretching) and nutrition (advice and protein supplementation)). The study has two primary outcomes: in-hospital complications and patient-reported disability 30 days after surgery. Secondary outcomes include survival, lower limb function, quality of life and resource utilisation. A sample size of 750 participants (375 per arm) provides >90% power to detect a minimally important absolute difference of 8 on the 100-point patient-reported disability scale and a 25% relative risk reduction in complications, using a two-sided alpha value of 0.025 to account for the two primary outcomes.

Prehabilitation may increase reserve and improve postoperative outcomes. Our objective was to determine if home-based prehabilitation improves postoperative functional recovery in older adults with frailty having cancer surgery. METHODS: This double blind randomised trial enrolled people ≥60 yr having elective cancer surgery and ≥3 weeks from enrolment to surgery as eligible. Participation in a remotely supported, home-based exercise prehabilitation program plus nutritional guidance was compared with standard care plus written advice on age-appropriate activity and nutrition. The primary outcome was 6-min walk test (6MWT) distance at the first postoperative clinic visit. Secondary outcomes included physical performance, quality of life, disability, length of stay, non-home discharge, and 30-day readmission. RESULTS: Of 543 patients assessed, 254 were eligible and 204 (80%) were randomised (102 per arm); 182 (94 intervention and 88 control) had surgery and were analysed. Mean age was 74 yr and 57% were female. Mean duration of participation was 5 weeks, mean adherence was 61% (range 0%-100%).

Analyses using a prespecified adherence definition of ≥80% supported improvements in 6MWT distance, complication count, and disability. CONCLUSIONS: A home-based prehabilitation program did not significantly improve postoperative recovery or other outcomes in older adults with frailty having cancer surgery. Program adherence may be a key mediator of prehabilitation efficacy. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02934230.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16705,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Design: Nested, case-control study. Setting: Cardiac surgical intensive care unit in a single-site hospital setting. Participants: The study comprised 24 older adults (aged >60 years) undergoing major cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: The primary outcome was a positive screen for delirium from postoperative days one through three based on criteria included in the long form of the Confusion Assessment Method. A multiplexed proteomic approach was applied using proximity extension assays to identify and quantify proteins found in serum collected on the day of surgery and postoperative day one in delirious and nondelirious patient cohorts. An increase in serum fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-21 levels was identified in the delirious cohort from a presurgery baseline of (mean ± standard deviation) 5.0 ± 1.1 log2 abundance (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.3-5.7) to 6.7 ± 1.6 log2 abundance (95% CI, 5.7-7.7; p = 0.01) postsurgery. A similar increase was identified in FGF-23 from a presurgery baseline of 1.7 ± 1.3 log2 abundance (95% CI, 0.8-2.5) to 3.4 ± 2.2 log2 abundance (95% CI, 2.0-4.8; p = 0.06) postsurgery. An increase in interleukin-6 serum levels also was identified in the delirious cohort from a presurgery baseline of 3.8 ± 1.1 log2 abundance (95% CI, 3.1-4.5) to 8.7 ± 1.9 log2 abundance (95% CI, 7.5-9.9; p < 0.0001) postsurgery. However, the increase in interleukin-6 serum levels of the nondelirious cohort also met the study's threshold for statistical significance (p < 0.0001). Finally, an increase in monocyte chemotactic protein-3 serum levels was identified in the delirious cohort from a presurgery baseline of 4.1 ± 0.9 log2 abundance (95% CI, 3.6-4.7) to 6.1 ± 2.0 log2 abundance (95% CI, 4.8-7; p = 0.009) postsurgery. Conclusions: FGF-21, FGF-23, interleukin-6, and monocyte chemotactic protein-3 serum levels were increased postoperatively in patients who developed delirium after major cardiac surgery. This study identified two members of the FGF family as potential putative systemic biomarkers for postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery, suggesting a possible role for metabolic recovery in the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying neurocognitive dysfunction.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 11220,Search update 2023-11-13,,

L., Downey, R. J., Vickers, A. J., Korc-Grodzicki, B., Shahrokni, A.",Association of frailty with 90-day postoperative mortality & geriatric comanagement among older adults with cancer,"INTRODUCTION: Geriatric medical comanagement of older surgical patients with cancer is associated with lower 90-day postoperative mortality. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that this association varies on the basis of the degree of a patient's frailty. METHODS: Frailty was assessed using the Memorial Sloan Kettering Frailty Index. Our hypothesis was evaluated using two approaches, both adjusted for age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status, preoperative albumin, operating room duration, and estimated blood loss. A logistic regression was performed with 90-day mortality as the outcome and geriatric comanagement, continuous Memorial Sloan Kettering Frailty Index, and an interaction term between these two variables as the primary predictors. We then categorized frailty into four levels and, within each level, performed logistic regression with geriatric comanagement as the primary predictor and 90-day mortality as the outcome. Finally, we extracted the effect size and used a meta-analytic approach to test for heterogeneity. RESULTS: Of 1687 patients aged ≥75 years who underwent elective cancer surgery with a length of stay of ≥1 day, 931 (55%) received comanagement; 31 patients (3.3%) who received comanagement died within 90 days, compared with 72 (9.5%) who did not. Ninety-day mortality was not statistically significantly different by degree of frailty in either analysis (interaction P = 0.4; test of heterogeneity P = 0.8). CONCLUSION: Geriatric comanagement is valuable for all older surgical patients, not just the frail, and should be provided to as large a portion of the older surgical population as possible. Further research should examine predictors of response to geriatric comanagement.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 6759,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Current treatment is based on revascularization to preserve the leg. In the older, hospitalized chronic limb threatening ischemia patient, delirium is a frequent and severe complication after revascularization. Delirium leads to an increased length of hospital stay, a higher mortality rate and a decrease in quality of life. Currently, no specific guidelines to prevent delirium in chronic limb threatening ischemia patients exist. We aim to evaluate the effect of a multicomponent, multidisciplinary prehabilitation program on the incidence of delirium in chronic limb threatening ischemia patients ≥65 years. DESIGN: A prospective observational cohort study to investigate the effects of the program on the incidence of delirium will be performed in a large teaching hospital in the Netherlands. This manuscript describes the design of the study and the content of this specific prehabilitation program. METHODS: Chronic limb threatening ischemia patients ≥65 years that require revascularization will participate in the program. This program focuses on optimizing the patient's overall health and includes delirium risk assessment, nutritional optimization, home-based physical therapy, iron infusion in case of anaemia and a comprehensive geriatric assessment in case of frailty. The primary outcome is the incidence of delirium. Secondary outcomes include quality of life, amputation-free survival, length of hospital stay and mortality. Exclusion criteria are the requirement of acute treatment or patients who are mentally incompetent to understand the procedures of the study or to complete questionnaires. A historical cohort from the same hospital is used as a control group. DISCUSSION: This study will clarify the effect of a prehabilitation program on delirium incidence in chronic limb threatening ischemia patients. New insights will be obtained on optimizing a patient's preoperative mental and physical condition to prevent postoperative complications, including delirium.

STUDY DESIGN: Case series with planned data collection. SETTING: Two tertiary care academic hospitals. METHODS: The VESPA was administered prospectively in the preoperative setting. Data on patient demographics, ablative and reconstructive procedures, and outcomes including total length of stay, discharge disposition, delay in discharge, or complex discharge planning (delay or change in disposition) were collected via retrospective chart review. VESPA scores were calculated and risk categories were used to estimate risk of adverse postoperative outcomes using multivariate logistic regression for categorical outcomes and linear regression for continuous variables. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients met study inclusion criteria. The mean (SD) age was 66.4 (11.9) years, and 58.4% of patients were male. Nearly one-fourth described preoperative difficulty in either a basic or instrumental activity of daily living, and 17% were classified as low functional status (ie, high risk) according to the VESPA. Low functional status did not independently predict length of stay but was associated with delayed discharge (odds ratio [OR], 5.0; 95% CI, 1.2-21.3; P = .030) and complex discharge planning (OR, 5.7; 95% CI, 1.34-24.2; P = .018). CONCLUSION: The VESPA can identify major head and neck surgical patients with low preoperative functional status who may be at risk for delayed or complex discharge planning. These patients may benefit from enhanced preoperative counseling and more comprehensive discharge preparation.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 5144,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Our objective was to evaluate the association between preoperative frailty and postoperative disability. METHODS: Patients were prospectively evaluated using the Comprehensive Assessment of Frailty score, separating patients into frail and non-frail cohorts. Disability levels were quantified using the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) 2.0 in percentage of the maximum disability score, with disability defined as a value ≥25%. RESULTS: Frail patients had increased median [inter-quartile range] disability scores of 31 [16-45]% preoperatively, 29 [9-54]% at 1 month, and 15 [3-31]% at 3 months postoperatively, compared with disability scores in non-frail patients of 10 [5-17]%, 17 [6-29]%, and 2.1 [0-12.0]%, respectively. Preoperative frailty was associated with a reduced likelihood of patients being free of disability and alive at 3 months; adjusted odds ratio 0.51 (for age, European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II, and WHODAS 2.0: 12-Part Questionnaire score); P=0.045. The trajectory of disability scores, assessed in percentage change from the preoperative baseline, showed non-frail patients had increased disability burden at 1 month, whereas frail patients had reduced disability burden (+4.2% vs -2.1%; P=0.04). Although the disability burden decreased for both groups at 3 months, this was most marked for frail patients (-6.3% vs -10.4%; P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Disability burden in frail patients improves continuously postoperatively, whereas in non-frail patients, it worsens at 1 month before improving at 3 months postoperatively. This positive trajectory of patient-centred outcomes in frail patients should be considered in preoperative decision-making.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 6754,Search update 2023-11-13,,

This study aimed to examine associations of perioperative Barthel index score, a validated measure of ADLs, with survival outcomes following hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: We analyzed data of 492 consecutive patients who underwent hepatectomy for HCC between 2010 and 2018. Pre- and postoperative ADLs were assessed using the Barthel index (range, 0-100; higher scores indicate greater independence). Preoperative Barthel index score ≤85 or postoperative Barthel index score ≤85 was defined as impairment of perioperative ADLs. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) after adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Among the 492 patients, 26 (5.2%) had a preoperative Barthel index score ≤85 and 95 (19%) had a postoperative Barthel index score ≤85. Impairment of perioperative ADLs was independently associated with shorter overall survival (multivariable HR: 1.75, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06-2.81, p = 0.028). The association of impairment of perioperative ADLs with recurrence-free survival was not statistically significant.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between preoperative skeletal muscle evaluation and clinical outcomes in patients undergoing LVAD implantation. METHODS: From January 2010 to December 2017, a total of 63 patients were enrolled in this single-centre study. A retrospective analysis of preoperative abdominal computed tomography (CT) for psoas muscle index (PSMI) and Hounsfield-Units of the Psoas Muscle (PSHU) at the level of the mid-L4 vertebra was performed. RESULTS: Sixty-three patients (male; n = 49, 78%), with a mean age of 58.0 ± 11.8 years, were treated with LVAD due to dilated (32%) or ischemic cardiomyopathy (68%). Among them, 43 patients (68.3%) were categorized in the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support profile I. The survival rate was 73.0% at 30 days and 44.4% at 1 year. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses revealed that PSMI was a significant numeric predictor of 1-year mortality (P = 0.04). In contrast, PSHU displayed a significant predictive potential for pericardial effusion (P = 0.03) and respiratory insufficiency (P = 0.01). In addition, comparative ROC curve analysis revealed no significant difference in the predictive potential of PSMI and PSHU. CONCLUSION: Preoperative PSMI might be a predictor of 1-year mortality in patients undergoing LVAD implantation. In contrast, the PSHU seemed to potentially assume postoperative adverse events in this study.

The purpose of this study was to provide a certain preoperative surgical risk assessment tool for super-elderly people. METHODS: We selected 112 individuals who were super-elderly patients aged >90 years who had surgeries under general anesthesia in our department. Based on the quality of the postoperative outcome of each case, we categorized these patients into two groups: good and poor groups. We evaluated the fundamental examination items, such as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, skeletal muscle mass index and so on, and a couple of the well-known risk score systems represented by Estimation of Physiology Ability and Surgical Stress. RESULTS: A total of 85 of the 112 patients belonged to the good group and the rest belonged to the poor group. The quality of postoperative outcome is well characterized by Estimation of Physiology Ability and Surgical Stress (P = 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis of Estimation of Physiology Ability and Surgical Stress for the quality of postoperative outcome shows sensitivity of 0.83 and specificity of 0.61. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that skeletal muscle mass index and American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status are prominent as the risk determinants affecting the quality of postoperative outcome. A scoring system based on the skeletal muscle mass index, which is a good index of sarcopenia, and American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, named the ""SAP score"" has the following characteristics. P-value <0.001, sensitivity 0.76 and specificity 0.91.

The international, multicenter Geriatric Oncology Surgical Assessment and Functional rEcovery after Surgery (GOSAFE) Study compares QoL before and after surgery and identifies predictors of decline in QoL. METHODS: GOSAFE prospectively collected data before and after major elective cancer surgery on older adults (≥70 years). Frailty assessment was performed and postoperative outcomes recorded (30, 90, and 180 days postoperatively) together with QoL data by means of the three-level version of the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L), including 2 components: an index (range = 0-1) generated by 5 domains (mobility, self-care, ability to perform the usual activities, pain or discomfort, anxiety or depression) and a visual analog scale. RESULTS: Data from 26 centers were collected (February 2017-March 2019). Complete data were available for 942/1005 consecutive patients (94.0%): 492 male (52.2%), median age 78 years (range = 70-95 years), and primary tumor was colorectal in 67.8%. A total 61.2% of all surgeries were via a minimally invasive approach. The 30-, 90-, and 180-day mortality was 3.7%, 6.3%, and 9%, respectively.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, data from the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination database on 96,620 patients who had undergone cholecystectomy at 1060 hospitals from 2018 to 2020 were analyzed. Patients were divided into five age groups: < 75, 75-79, 80-84, 85-89, and ≥ 90 years. Associations between postoperative outcomes and age group were investigated by logistic regression analysis. Mean differences between age groups in time to postoperative recovery and cost were also compared. RESULTS: Older patients had higher rates of poor scores for activities of daily living and preoperative comorbidity. Compared with the youngest age group (< 75 years), the odds ratios for in-hospital mortality were 3.00 (95% confidence interval, 1.74-5.19), 7.54 (4.73-12.01), 13.47 (8.21-22.14), and 27.64 (15.56-49.09), in the 75-79, 80-84, 85-89, and ≥ 90-year-old age group, respectively (all p < 0.001).

The overall incidence rate varies from 5% to 52% of hospitalized surgical patients based on the type of surgery that often began in the postanesthesia care unit and continues up to 5 days post-surgery. Postoperative delirium manifests as a hypoactive, hyperactive and mixed subtype. The mechanism of delirium development is not clear, but it is accepted that delirium is a result of the patient’s underlying vulnerabilities or risk factors combined with an outside stressor such as infection or surgery. Objective: To develop evidence-based recommendations for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of postoperative delirium. Methods: Literature was searched from PubMed, CINAH, Google Scholar, and Cochrane databases that are published from 2010 to 2021 by formulating inclusion and exclusion criteria. Filtering was made depending on methodological quality, outcome, and data on population. Finally, 11 meta-analysis, 11 systematic reviews, 7 interventional studies, 11 observational studies, and recommendations of the previous clinical practice guideline developed by the American and European are included in this review. Results: A total of 43 studies were considered in this evaluation. The development of this guideline was based on nine studies on risk stratification for postoperative delirium, eighteen studies on risk minimization and prevention for postoperative delirium, five studies on diagnosis for postoperative delirium, and eleven studies on treatments for postoperative delirium. Conclusion: Postoperative delirium management can be categorized into risk assessment, risk minimization, early diagnosis, and treatment. Early diagnosis is critical to trigger focused and effective treatment. Non-pharmacological interventions are the first-line management for both hypoactive and hyperactive postoperative with considering contributory factors and underlying causes. Antipsychotics should only be used for hyperactive delirium individuals who try to harm themselves.

Results: The BCTSQ symptom severity scale and functional status scale showed significant improvement following surgery in Group B compared to Group A at 2 weeks,6 weeks and 3 months (p < 0.05). At 6 months and 1 year follow up, both the symptom severity and functional status scale were comparable in both the groups. Grip strength, pillar pain and scar tenderness showed significant improvement in transverse flexor incision group compared to longitudinal palmar incision group at 6 weeks and 3 months and were comparable later on. Conclusion: We conclude that the mini open transverse flexor crease incision technique using the conventional instruments is simple, safe and cost-effective mode of treatment of idiopathic CTS when compared to the limited palmar incision technique. Though the long term outcomes are comparable in both groups, the flexor crease transverse incision group patients had better pain relief, better cosmesis and shorter recovery period than the palmar incision group",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16433,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Physiological age should be a priority when considering the indications for adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery. The primary objective of this study was to determine the characteristics of the postoperative course, surgical outcomes, and complication rates to extend the healthy life expectancy of older ASD patients (≥ 75 years). The secondary objective was to clarify the importance of physiological age in the surgical treatment of older ASD patients, considering frailty. METHODS: A retrospective review of 109 consecutive patients aged ≥ 65 years with symptomatic ASD who underwent a corrective long fusion with lateral interbody fusion from the lower thoracic spine to the pelvis from 2015 to 2019 was conducted. Patients were classified into two groups according to age (group Y [65-74 years], group O [≥ 75 years]) and further divided into four groups according to the ASD-frailty index score (Y-F, Y-NF, O-F, and O-NF groups). To account for potential risk factors for perioperative course characteristics, complication rates, and surgical outcomes, patients from the database were subjected to propensity score matching based on sex, BMI, and preoperative sagittal spinal alignment (C7 sagittal vertical axis, pelvic incidence-lumbar lordosis, and pelvic tilt). Clinical outcomes were evaluated 2 years postoperatively, using three patient-reported outcome measures of health-related quality of life: the Oswestry Disability Index, Scoliosis Research Society questionnaire (SRS-22), and Short Form 36 (SF-36). Additionally, the postoperative time-to-first ambulation, as well as minor, major, and mechanical complications, were evaluated. RESULTS: In the comparison between Y and O groups, patients in group O were at a higher risk of minor complications (delirium and urinary tract infection). In contrast, other surgical outcomes of group O were comparable to those of group Y, except for SRS-22 (satisfaction) and time to ambulation after surgery, with better outcomes in Group O. Patients in the O-NF group had better postoperative outcomes (time to ambulation after surgery, SRS-22 (function, self-image, satisfaction), SF-36 [PCS]) than those in the Y-F group. CONCLUSIONS: Older age warrants monitoring of minor complications in the postoperative management of patients. However, the outcomes of ASD surgery depended more on frailty than on chronological age. Older ASD patients without frailty might tolerate corrective surgery and have satisfactory outcomes when minimally invasive techniques are used. Physiological age is more important than chronological age when determining the indications for surgery in older patients with ASD.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16963,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Methods: Retrospective review of the Society for Vascular Surgery Vascular Quality Initiative, a large, multi-center, registry database was performed. All individuals undergoing EVAR (n = 18,730) and TEVAR (n = 6595) for non-ruptured aortic pathologies between 2014 and 2018 were eligible for analysis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the association of pre-procedure ECOG functional performance status on risk of in-hospital adverse cardiovascular events, vascular events, and mortality. Results: The number of operations complicated by adverse cardiovascular and vascular events was 480 (2.6%) and 190 (1.0%) for EVAR and 733 (11.1%) and 219 (3.3%) for TEVAR, respectively. There were 118 (0.6%) and 240 (3.6%) in-hospital deaths following EVAR and TEVAR, respectively. Patients with ECOG grades 3 or 4 undergoing EVAR were at increased risk of cardiovascular events (OR = 1.62; 95% CI = 1.09, 2.41) and one-year mortality (HR = 2.62; 95% CI = 1.92, 3.57) compared to those with ECOG grade 0. Patients undergoing TEVAR with ECOG grade 3 or 4 were at increased risk for both inpatient death (OR = 2.77; 95% CI = 1.56, 4.9) and one-year mortality (HR = 3.27, 95% CI = 2.06, 5.21). ECOG status was not associated with an increased risk of adverse vascular events following either EVAR or TEVAR. Conclusions: Poor preoperative functional status as assessed by ECOG score is associated with an increased risk of adverse postoperative cardiovascular events following EVAR and a higher mortality risk following both EVAR and TEVAR. Functional status assessment may be useful for risk stratification and determining procedural candidacy prior to EVAR and TEVAR.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16434,Search update 2023-11-13,,

B.",Alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonists for the prevention of delirium and cognitive decline after open heart surgery (ALPHA2PREVENT): protocol for a multicentre randomised controlled trial,"INTRODUCTION: Postoperative delirium is common in older cardiac surgery patients and associated with negative short-term and long-term outcomes. The alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist dexmedetomidine shows promise as prophylaxis and treatment for delirium in intensive care units (ICU) and postoperative settings. Clonidine has similar pharmacological properties and can be administered both parenterally and orally. We aim to study whether repurposing of clonidine can represent a novel treatment option for delirium, and the possible effects of dexmedetomidine and clonidine on long-term cognitive trajectories, motor activity patterns and biomarkers of neuronal injury, and whether these effects are associated with frailty status. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This five-centre, double-blind randomised controlled trial will include 900 cardiac surgery patients aged 70+ years. Participants will be randomised 1:1:1 to dexmedetomidine or clonidine or placebo. The study drug will be given as a continuous intravenous infusion from the start of cardiopulmonary bypass, at a rate of 0.4 µg/kg/hour. The infusion rate will be decreased to 0.2 µg/kg/hour postoperatively and be continued until discharge from the ICU or 24 hours postoperatively, whichever happens first.Primary end point is the 7-day cumulative incidence of postoperative delirium (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition). Secondary end points include the composite end point of coma, delirium or death, in addition to delirium severity and motor activity patterns, levels of circulating biomarkers of neuronal injury, cognitive function and frailty status 1 and 6 months after surgery. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial is approved by the Regional Committee for Ethics in Medical Research in Norway (South-East Norway) and by the Norwegian Medicines Agency. Dissemination plans include publication in peer-reviewed medical journals and presentation at scientific meetings.

Trial outcomes evaluating pain, prescription analgesic use, and patient satisfaction have not yet been reported. OBJECTIVE: To compare pain, analgesic use, and satisfaction after hip fracture surgery with spinal versus general anesthesia. DESIGN: Preplanned secondary analysis of a pragmatic randomized trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02507505). SETTING: 46 U.S. and Canadian hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 50 years or older undergoing hip fracture surgery. INTERVENTION: Spinal or general anesthesia. MEASUREMENTS: Pain on postoperative days 1 through 3; 60-, 180-, and 365-day pain and prescription analgesic use; and satisfaction with care. RESULTS: A total of 1600 patients were enrolled. The average age was 78 years, and 77% were women. A total of 73.5% (1050 of 1428) of patients reported severe pain during the first 24 hours after surgery. Worst pain over the first 24 hours after surgery was greater with spinal anesthesia (rated from 0 [no pain] to 10 [worst pain imaginable]; mean difference, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.12 to 0.68]). Pain did not differ across groups at other time points. Prescription analgesic use at 60 days occurred in 25% (141 of 563) and 18.8% (108 of 574) of patients assigned to spinal and general anesthesia, respectively (relative risk, 1.33 [CI, 1.06 to 1.65]). Satisfaction was similar across groups. LIMITATION: Missing outcome data and multiple outcomes assessed. CONCLUSION: Severe pain is common after hip fracture. Spinal anesthesia was associated with more pain in the first 24 hours after surgery and more prescription analgesic use at 60 days compared with general anesthesia.

This study aimed to identify factors that predict changes in the level of support for activities of daily living and mobility 1 year after colonic cancer surgery. METHODS: This was a multicentre, observational study conforming to STROBE guidelines. The prospective data included pre-and postoperative mobility and need for support in daily activities, co-morbidities, onco-geriatric screening tool (G8), clinical frailty scale (CFS), operative data, and postoperative surgical outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 167 patients aged 80 years or more with colonic cancer were recruited. After surgery, 30 per cent and 22 per cent of all patients had increased need for support and decreased motility. Multivariableanalysis with all patients demonstrated that preoperative support in daily activities outside the home (OR 3.23, 95 per cent c.i. 1.06 to 9.80, P = 0.039) was associated with an increased support at follow-up. A history of cognitive impairment (3.15, 1.06 to 9.34, P = 0.038) haemoglobin less than 120 g/l (7.48, 1.97 to 28.4, P = 0.003) and discharge to other medical facilities (4.72, 1.39 to 16.0, P = 0.013) were independently associated with declined mobility. With functionally independent patients, haemoglobin less than 120 g/l (8.31, 1.76 to 39.2, P = 0.008) and discharge to other medical facilities (4.38, 1.20 to 16.0, P = 0.026) were associated with declined mobility. CONCLUSION: Increased need for support before surgery, cognitive impairment, preoperative anaemia, and discharge to other medical facilities predicts an increased need for support or declined mobility 1 year after colonic cancer surgery. Preoperative assessment and optimization should focus on anaemia correction, nutritional status, and mobility with detailed rehabilitation plan.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16805,Search update 2023-11-13,,

P., Hight, D., Sleigh, J., Kaiser, H. A., García, P. S., Schneider, G., Kreuzer, M.",The First Derivative of the Electroencephalogram Facilitates Tracking of Electroencephalographic Alpha Band Activity During General Anesthesia,"BACKGROUND: Intraoperative neuromonitoring can help to navigate anesthesia. Pronounced alpha oscillations in the frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) appear to predict favorable perioperative neurocognitive outcomes and may also provide a measure of intraoperative antinociception. Monitoring the presence and strength of these alpha oscillations can be challenging, especially in elderly patients, because the EEG in these patients may be dominated by oscillations in other frequencies. Hence, the information regarding alpha oscillatory activity may be hidden and hard to visualize on a screen. Therefore, we developed an effective approach to improve the detection and presentation of alpha activity in the perioperative setting. METHODS: We analyzed EEG records of 180 patients with a median age of 60 years (range, 18-90 years) undergoing noncardiac, nonneurologic surgery under general anesthesia with propofol induction and sevoflurane maintenance. We calculated the power spectral density (PSD) for the unprocessed EEG as well as for the time-discrete first derivative of the EEG (diffPSD) from 10-second epochs. Based on these data, we estimated the power-law coefficient κ of the PSD and diffPSD, as the EEG coarsely follows a 1/fκ distribution when displayed in double logarithmic coordinates. In addition, we calculated the alpha (7.8-12.1 Hz) to delta (0.4-4.3 Hz) ratio from the PSD as well as diffPSD. RESULTS: The median κ was 0.899 [first and third quartile: 0.786, 0.986] for the unaltered PSD, and κ = -0.092 [-0.202, -0.013] for the diffPSD, corresponding to an almost horizontal PSD of the differentiated EEG. The alpha-to-delta ratio of the diffPSD was strongly increased (median ratio = -8.0 dB [-10.5, -4.7 dB] for the unaltered PSD versus 30.1 dB [26.1, 33.8 dB] for the diffPSD). A strong narrowband oscillatory alpha power component (>20% of total alpha power) was detected in 23% using PSD, but in 96% of the diffPSD. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that the calculation of the diffPSD from the time-discrete derivative of the intraoperative frontal EEG is a straightforward approach to improve the detection of alpha activity by eliminating the broadband background noise. This improvement in alpha peak detection and visualization could facilitate the guidance of general anesthesia and improve patient outcome.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16875,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Nutritional intervention may improve the patient's nutritional status and reduce risk, but this is unexplored regarding ASD surgery.Methods.Malnourished patients (i.e., a prognostic nutritional index [PNI] score of <50) scheduled for surgery after November 2018 (Group I) received nutritional intervention consisting of nutritional guidance and supplements on the surgery day. The medical complication rates between Group I and Group NI (malnourished patients who underwent surgery between January 2014 and October 2018; historical controls) were evaluated. The nutritional status courses of Group I and Group NI2 (patients who did not participate in nutritional intervention after November 2018) were assessed.Results.Group I had 24 patients in (mean age, 70 yr), and Group NI had 69 patients (mean age, 68 yr). The mean intervention duration was 41 days. The preoperative PNI score did not differ between the groups, but there was a significant difference in medical complications incidences (Group I: 25%; Group NI: 53.6%; P = 0.015). The nutritional status significantly deteriorated in Group I (PNI: 47-45; P = 0.011) and Group NI2 (61 patients; mean age, 68 yr; PNI: 52-48; P = 0.000), but the PNI changes were significantly smaller in Group I (ΔPNI: Group I: -1.9, Group NI 2: -3.5; P = 0.027).Conclusion.Nutritional intervention with guidance and supplements reduced postoperative medical complications in malnourished patients. The nutritional status of ASD patients requiring surgery also naturally worsened, suggesting that ASD may contribute to malnutrition. Nutritional intervention may reduce the nutritional status deterioration.Level of Evidence: 3.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 12002,Search update 2023-11-13,,

This study aimed to investigate the long-term outcomes of elderly patients 80 years and older after CRC surgery in comparison with younger age groups. The influence of clinical, oncological, and physical parameters on outcome were retrospectively analyzed. Methods: A total of 346 patients underwent CRC surgery with curative intent between January 2013 and December 2017. Patients were divided into three age groups: younger than 60 (n=47), between 60 and 79 (n=218), and 80 and older (n=81). Clinicopathological variables including comorbidity, modified frailty index, prognostic nutrition index (PNI), operative/postoperative data, and outcome including cause of death were compared among age groups. To identify factors associated with death from CRC and other causes, univariate and multivariate analyses using the Cox proportional hazards model were performed. Results: Immediate postoperative morbidity of patients with Clavien-Dindo grades of III or greater (16.0%) and the 30-day mortality rate (2.5%) of patients 80 years and older were not statistically different from those of younger age groups. Long-term disease-free survival was also similar among age groups, suggesting CRC surgery provides oncological benefit to patients irrespective of age. Multivariate analysis revealed that R1 resection, advanced tumor stage, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level of >5 ng/mL, undifferentiated tumor, and longer postoperative hospital stay were risk factors for CRC death. Long-term overall survival was significantly reduced in comparison to younger age groups. Seventy percent of deaths in elderly patients during follow-up were primarily from respiratory failure and cardiovascular disease. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that advanced age, frailty, low PNI, and open procedure were risk factors for other causes of mortality. Conclusions: Elderly patients undergoing CRC surgery appeared to enjoy similar oncological benefits as younger age groups. Since both modified frailty index and PNI were correlated with mortality unrelated to CRC, preoperative assessment of these factors can be important for predicting outcome and selecting patients for prehabilitation. © 2022 AME Publishing Company.

DESIGN: In a randomised approach, a delirium prevention and a standard care group were compared regarding manifestation of postoperative cognitive dysfunction at seven days, three and twelve months postoperatively (primary outcome). To correct for practice effects and age-depended cognitive decline, a control group of age-matched healthy subjects was included. SETTING: The trial was conducted at the University Medical Centre Hamburg between 2014 and 2018, data assessment took place in the Anaesthesia Outpatient Clinic and on the surgical ward. PATIENTS: A total of 609 patients ≥60 years scheduled for cardiovascular surgery were enrolled, allocated treatment was received by 284 patients in the delirium prevention and 274 patients in the standard care group. INTERVENTION: The intervention consisted of a delirium prevention bundle including reorientation measures, sleeping aids and early mobilisation. MEASUREMENTS: Cognitive functions were assessed via neuropsychological testing of attention, executive functions including word fluency, and verbal memory utilizing a computerised test of attentional performance, the trail making test, the digit span subtest from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV, the verbal learning and memory test, and the Regensburg Word Fluency Test. Assessments were performed preoperatively and at three time points postoperatively (one week, three months and 12 months). MAIN RESULTS: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction was defined as a clinically meaningful decline in at least two out of nine chosen test parameters compared to the preoperative level (reliable change index ≤ - 1.96). The rates of postoperative cognitive dysfunction were 25.9% (delirium prevention group, n = 284) vs. 28.1% (standard care group, n = 274) [X(2)(1,n = 433) = 0.245;p = 0.621] at postoperative day seven and declined to 7.8% vs. 6.8% [X(2)(1,n = 219) = 0.081;p = 0.775] and 1.3% vs. 5.6% (p = 0.215, Fisher's exact test) at three and 12 months following surgery, respectively. The postoperative delirium rates did not differ between the two groups (delirium prevention group: 13.4% vs. standard care group: 17.3%). Attentional performance was impaired shortly after surgery, whereas verbal delayed recall was most frequently affected over the whole postoperative period. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that an intervention combining specific measures extracted from established postoperative delirium prevention programs did not reduce the rate of postoperative cognitive dysfunction in older adults.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 8067,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Patients and methods: This single-center, retrospective, observational study included 110 patients who underwent an esophagectomy. We assigned the patients with the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist score ≥ 4 to the POD group. We performed multivariable logistic regression analyses to determine whether the NLR, PLR, MPV, and PDW can be used to predict the development of POD. Results: The POD group had 20 patients; the non-POD group included the other 90 patients. Although only the preoperative NLR in the POD group was significantly higher than in the non-POD group (3.20 [2.52–4.30] vs. 2.05 [1.45–3.02], p = 0.001), multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that the following three parameters were independent predictors of POD: preoperative NLR ≥ 2.45 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 8.68, 95%CI 2.33–32.4, p = 0.001), MPV ≥ 10.4 (aOR: 3.93, 95%CI: 1.37–11.2, p = 0.011), and PDW ≥ 11.8 (aOR: 3.58, 95%CI: 1.22–10.5, p = 0.020). Conclusion: Our analysis results demonstrated that preoperative NLR ≥ 2.45, MPV ≥ 10.4, and PDW ≥ 11.8 were significantly associated with a higher risk of POD after adjustment for possible confounding factors.

Mucociliary clearance was assessed by nasal saccharine transit time (STT). After the preoperative STT measurement, the patients were taken to the operating room, and divided into two equal groups as group 1 and 2 (n= 30 for each group). Midazolam, propofol, and rocuronium were used in all patients. Anesthesia was maintained by sevoflurane at a flow rate of 6 lt/min (50% O2 - 50% N2O) with a minimum alveolar concentration of 1.3-1.5. After the surgical procedure, atropine-neostigmine (20 mcg/kg - 50 mcg/kg) and sugammadex (2 mg/kg) were administered to group 1 and group 2, respectively, and then the patients were extubated. The postoperative STT was measured in postoperative period. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 53 (±16) years, and 56 (93%) of them were male. There were no differences between the groups in terms of age, gender, height, weight, ASA score, and duration of anesthesia, duration of surgery, postoperative period, preoperative STT, and postoperative STT. However, when each group was evaluated separately, there was a statistically significant increase in the postoperative STT compared to the preoperative STT in both groups (p=0.005 for group 1, p<0.001 for group 2).

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data and outcomes of consecutive patients who had undergone elective FB-EVAR from 2007 to 2019 in a single institution. A previously validated 11-item modified frailty index (mFI-11) was derived from the comorbidity and preoperative functional status data. An mFI-11 <0.3 was defined as low risk, 0.3 to 0.5 as medium risk, and >0.5 as high risk. The studied outcomes were 90-day mortality, major adverse events (MAE), and long-term survival. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify the independent predictors of these outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 592 patients (155 women, mean age, 75 ± 8 years) had undergone FB-EVAR. Using the mFI-11, 310 patients (52%) were included in the low-risk, 199 (34%) in the medium-risk, and 83 (14%) in the high-risk group. The 90-day mortality was significantly higher in the high-risk group than in the medium- and low-risk groups (13%, 4%, and 3%, respectively; P < .01). The corresponding MAE rates were 27%, 18%, and 19% (P = .23). As a subgroup, 44 patients in the high-risk group had had chronic kidney disease (CKD). The 90-day mortality for these patients was as high as 23%, and 32% had experienced MAE. On multivariable analysis, the independent risk factors for 90-day mortality were CKD, respiratory disease, and a high mFI-11. The independent risk factors for MAE were female sex, CKD, larger aneurysm diameter, and the high-risk subgroup with CKD. The independent risk factors for long-term mortality were age, a low body mass index, CKD, larger aneurysm diameter, extent I-III thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm, respiratory disease, congestive heart failure, a history of cerebrovascular problems, and higher mFI-11. The estimated survival at 1 year was 91% ± 2% in the low-risk, 88% ± 2% in the medium-risk, and 78% ± 5% in the high-risk group (P < .001). The corresponding 5-year survival estimates were 60% ± 4%, 52% ± 5%, and 32% ± 6%. The mean follow-up time was 2.9 ± 2.3 years. The patients treated during the first quartile of the study period were significantly more frail than were those in the later quartiles. Also, the outcomes of FB-EVAR had improved over time. CONCLUSIONS: Greater frailty was significantly associated with early mortality. Together with CKD, frailty was also associated with MAE and lower patient survival after FB-EVAR.

The modified frailty index 5 (mFI-5) is a concise comorbidity-based scale that has been shown to accurately predict adverse surgical outcomes. In this study, we sought to evaluate the ability of the mFI-5 to predict the risk of postoperative outcomes in breast reconstruction patients. METHODS: Utilizing the 2015-2019 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database, we identified 40,415 patients who underwent breast reconstruction, of which 29,562 were implant-based reconstructions and 10,853 were autologous breast reconstructions. Demographic and preoperative variables as well as 30-day postoperative outcomes, including mortality, operation duration, length of hospital stay, medical and surgical complications, and discharge destination, were extracted. RESULTS: Increases in the mFI score correlated with higher rates of reoperation (mFI≥3: 13.5% vs. mFI=0: 5.9%), unplanned readmission (mFI≥3: 10.8% vs. mFI=0: 3.6%), surgical (mFI≥3: 12.2% vs. mFI=0: 4.3%) and medical complications (mFI≥3: 6.8% vs. mFI=0: 1.2%), and lower rates of home discharge (mFI≥3: 96% vs. mFI=0: 99.5%). Multivariate analysis to control for confounders verified significantly higher rates of reoperation (OR=0.01, 95%CI 0.005-0.016), unplanned readmission (OR=0.009, 95%CI 0.005-0.014), and occurrence of surgical complications (OR=0.014, 95%CI 0.009-0.019) and medical complications (OR=0.005, 95%CI 0.002-0.008). Stratification by age showed that the mFI-5 was a stronger risk predictor in younger patients who are frail. Stratification by type of reconstruction showed that increased mFI scores significantly correlated with complications in both autologous and implant-based reconstruction, but the correlation was greater in autologous procedures. CONCLUSION: The mFI-5 is identified as a powerful risk predictor in breast reconstruction. The application of this easily accessible tool in the preoperative risk stratification of patients undergoing breast reconstruction can enhance treatment planning and support, optimizing patient counseling, informed consent, and decision-making.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16927,Search update 2023-11-13,,

The authors evaluated the effect of epidural anesthesia on arterial maximal flow velocity of the free flap in microvascular lower extremity reconstruction. METHODS: This is a prospective randomized study where patients were allocated to receive either combined general-epidural anesthesia (epidural group, n = 26) or general anesthesia alone (control group, n = 26). After injecting epidural ropivacaine 10 ml in the epidural group, the effect on arterial maximal flow velocity of the free flap was analyzed using ultrasonography. The primary outcome measurement was the arterial maximal flow velocity 30 minutes after establishing the baseline. Intraoperative hemodynamics and postoperative outcomes such as postoperative pain, opioid requirements, surgical complications, intensive care unit admission, and hospital length of stay were also assessed. RESULTS: The arterial maximal flow velocity 30 minutes after the baseline measurement was significantly higher in the epidural group (35.3 ± 13.9 cm/second versus 23.5 ± 8.4 cm/second; p = 0.001). The pain score at 1 hour postoperatively and opioid requirements at 1 and 6 hours postoperatively were significantly lower in the epidural group [3.0 (interquartile range, 2.0 to 5.0) versus 5.0 (interquartile range, 3.0 to 6.0), p = 0.019; 0.0 μg (interquartile range, 0.0 to 50.0 μg) versus 50.0 μg (interquartile range, 0.0 to 100.0 μg), p = 0.005; and 46.9 μg (interquartile range, 0.0 to 66.5 μg) versus 96.9 μg (interquartile range, 41.7 to 100.0 μg), p = 0.014, respectively].

M.",A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Examining the Impact of Age on Perioperative Inflammatory Biomarkers,"BACKGROUND: Dysregulation of immune responses to surgical stress in older patients and those with frailty may manifest as differences in inflammatory biomarkers. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine differences in perioperative inflammatory biomarkers between older and younger patients, and between patients with and without frailty. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and CINAHL databases were searched (Inception to June 23, 2020). Observational or experimental studies reporting the perioperative level or activity of biomarkers in surgical patients stratified by age or frailty status were included. The primary outcome was inflammatory biomarkers (grouped by window of ascertainment: pre-op; post-op: <12 hours, 12-24 hours, 1-3 days, 3 days to 1 week, and >1 week). Quality assessment was conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Inverse-variance, random-effects meta-analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Forty-five studies (4263 patients) were included in the review, of which 36 were pooled for meta-analysis (28 noncardiac and 8 cardiac studies). Two studies investigated frailty as the exposure, while the remaining investigated age. In noncardiac studies, older patients had higher preoperative levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP), lower preoperative levels of lymphocytes, and higher postoperative levels of IL-6 (<12 hours) and CRP (12-24 hours) than younger patients. In cardiac studies, older patients had higher preoperative levels of IL-6 and CRP and higher postoperative levels of IL-6 (<12 hours and >1 week). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate a paucity of frailty-specific studies; however, the presence of age-associated differences in the perioperative inflammatory response is consistent with age-associated states of chronic systemic inflammation and immunosenescence.

RESULTS: Among 31,338 patients who underwent primary hepatopancreatic surgery, 4,259 (13.6%) had an increased level of care at discharge compared to their preadmission care. Patients with increased discharge care had a higher proportion of patients with a modified frailty index of at least 2 (n = 1496; 35.1%) compared with individuals with unchanged care (n = 6,760; 25.0%). In addition, 12.3% (n = 3,858) were discharged to a skilled nursing or rehabilitation facility. Of note, the odds of increased care at discharge were increased by 1.41 (95% confidence interval: 1.32-1.50), 1.11 (95% confidence interval :1.11-1.12), and 1.95 (95% confidence interval:1.86-2.04) times with every unit increase in modified frailty index, age beyond 65 years, and the number of in-hospital complications, respectively. Area under receiver operative curve for the parsimonious model used to develop the risk calculator was 0.7486 (95% confidence interval: 0.7405-0.7566) (all P < .001). CONCLUSION: Approximately, 1 in 7 patients required an increased level of care at the time of discharge compared with their preadmission status. A simplified web-based risk tool can be used in clinical practice as a surgical decision aid in post-discharge planning after complex elective surgery.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16856,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Identifying frailty using a two-step approach, starting with the use of a screening tool (G8) followed by comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), may be useful in guiding treatment decisions and follow-up. This study evaluated the association between G8 and CGA, and the risk of 90-day postoperative complications risk, in oncogeriatric patients. METHODS: Data on geriatric patients with major oncological abdominal surgery was retrospectively collected from our hospital records between 2016 and 2019. Patients with an impaired G8 screening score, who subsequently underwent CGA geriatric screening, were included. Postoperative complications were classified using the Clavien-Dindo classification (CD), and the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI). The association between the individual components of the geriatric assessment tools and the 90-day postoperative complications risk was analyzed. RESULTS: One hundred and twelve patients, aged ≥ 70 years, operated for an intra-abdominal tumor with curative intent, were included. Seventy-six patients (67.9%) presented with an impaired G8, out of whom sixty-six (58.9%) had a CGA performed. On univariate analysis, altered nutritional status assessed by the Mini-Nutritional Assessment-Short Form was the only variable associated with higher postoperative total complication rate (p = 0.01). Patients with an impaired G8 had significantly more postoperative complications and higher 1-year mortality rates than patients with normal G8. Fifteen patients (13.4%) had grade III-IVb complications. A CCI > 50 was recorded in 16 patients (14.3%). All-cause 90-day postoperative mortality was 10.7%. CONCLUSION: Identifying an altered preoperative nutritional status, as part of the CGA, in patients screening positive for frailty, is a potentially modifiable risk factor that can enhance preoperative management and optimize treatment decision making. G8 may be a predictive factor for postoperative complications in oncogeriatric patients.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16938,Search update 2023-11-13,,

METHODS: Adult patients undergoing pancreatic resection from 2019-2021 were enrolled in a pilot prehabilitation program. Three validated measures of physical status were used: the 6-minute walk test, grip strength, and chair-stand test. The prehabilitation program comprised 7,500 steps, 30 grip strength exercises, and 100 chair-stand exercises daily. Patients' frailty score was calculated using the Modified Johns Hopkins Frailty score. Changes in physical status measures after prehabilitation and postoperative outcomes were compared. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients with a median age of 69.0 years (interquartile range = 59.5-76.3 years) were included. Patients' median duration of participation was 21.5 days (interquartile range = 16-29 days). There was a negative correlation between increasing frailty score and baseline the 6-minute walk test (R(2) = 0.17) and chair-stand test (R(2) = 0.18). Patients' mean the 6-minute walk test decreased at the end of the prehabilitation program, while grip strength and chair-stand test were unchanged. When stratified by low or intermediate and high frailty scores, the differences in the 6-minute walk test and chair-stand test were unchanged. Hospital duration of stay, complications, and 90-day readmission rates were not different between frailty groups (P > .05). CONCLUSION: Correlation of physical status measures with frailty score suggests only one of these measures is sufficient to estimate patients' preoperative physical status. A longer, more comprehensive prehabilitation program or an expedited operation are likely the best strategies to improve patient outcomes.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 7351,Search update 2023-11-13,,

M., Bhargavan, R. V., Augustine, P., Thomas, S.",Comparison of preoperative assessment tools in older patients undergoing cancer surgery: A prospective study,"INTRODUCTION: Surgery in older adults with cancer is complex due to multiple age related confounding factors. There are many scoring systems available for preoperative risk stratifications of older patients. Currently very few prospective studies comparing the various commonly used scales are available. This is the first study which compares the established preoperative risk assessment tools of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Scale (ECOG) and American Society of Anaesthesiologists Physical Status Scale (ASA) with frailty scores of Modified Frailty Index (MFI) and Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a prospective observational study of older patients with cancer who underwent oncosurgery in a tertiary cancer centre during the one-year study period. Patients were scored on the CFS, MFI, ASA and ECOG scales. All patients were followed up for 30 days immediately following surgery and their post operative complications were documented. Univariate and multivariate analyses were done and a p value of ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Of the 820 patients studied, 15.6% had prolonged hospital stay, 9.1% had 30-day morbidity, 0.7% had readmission, and mortality was 1.1%. High-risk scores on the ASA and CFS were significantly associated with prolonged postoperative stay, readmission, morbidity, and mortality (p < 0.05). High-risk scores on the ECOG was significantly associated with prolonged hospital stay (p = 0.027), 30-day morbidity (p = 0.003), and mortality (p = 0.001), but not with readmission. There was no significant association between MFI score and the postoperative variables studied (p > 0.05). On multivariate analysis, morbidity was significantly associated only with male gender (p = 0.015), higher cancer stage (p = 0.005), higher ASA score (p = 0.029), and prolonged hospital stay (p = 0.001). Mortality was significantly associated only with emergency surgery (p = 0.012) and prolonged hospital stay (p = 0.004), and prolonged hospital stay was significantly associated with advanced cancer stage (p = 0.001) and emergency surgery (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In older patients undergoing cancer surgery, ASA and CFS are predictors of prolonged postoperative stay, morbidity, mortality, and readmission. A high-risk ECOG score is predictive of prolonged post operative stay, 30-day morbidity, and mortality, but not of readmission. Score on MFI is not a predictor of postoperative outcomes. Newer predictive tools which include cancer- specific factors are required for better management of these patients.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 6818,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Y., Shahrokni, A., Zakeri, K.",Outcomes following head and neck cancer surgery among older adults as determined by an electronic geriatric assessment,"PURPOSE: Older adults with head and neck cancer have increased postoperative complications, longer hospital stays, and higher rates of mortality. Geriatric assessment (GA) provides a measure of overall health status and is preferable to using age alone for assessing fitness for surgery. We sought to determine whether a patient's frailty as determined by a novel electronic GA is associated with outcomes after head and neck cancer (HNC) surgery. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 159 patients aged 75 and older referred to the Geriatrics Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center for pre-operative evaluation prior to undergoing HNC surgery. All patients completed the electronic Rapid Fitness Assessment (eRFA) within 60 days prior to surgery. The accumulated geriatric deficit (AGD) score includes twelve domains from the eRFA with a point assigned for each domain in which there is a deficit and a final point related to comorbidities. Three other metrics were individually assessed: age, Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS), and number of comorbidities. We utilized multivariable linear regression and t-tests to determine whether frailty is associated with longer length of hospital stay, 30-day intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and 30-day and 90-day postoperative mortality. RESULTS: Patients with a higher AGD score spent more time in the hospital post-operatively (1.0 day increase per unit increase in AGD; 95% CI: 0.21-1.9; p = 0.015). Lower KPS was also associated with statistically significant longer length of stay (-2.70 day change per increasing index KPS; 95% CI: -4.30 - -1.00; days; p = 0.002), while age and comorbidity were not found to be statistically associated with length of stay. Higher AGD score remained significantly associated with longer length of stay on multivariable analysis (0.93 day increase per unit increase in AGD; 95% CI 0.15-1.71; p = 0.019). AGD was the only metric associated with increased risk of ICU admission (6.6 vs 5.0 geriatric deficits for those admitted vs not admitted to ICU; p = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is associated with increased length of hospital stay and ICU admission in older adults with HNC undergoing surgery. GA can be used to counsel patients on the expected postoperative course.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 6791,Search update 2023-11-13,,

As patients turn 65 years, greater than 98% of the US population becomes eligible for Medicare, and this represents a time of changing healthcare coverage for many. METHODS: Patients undergoing elective TKA and THA were abstracted from the 2012 to 2018 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. Incidences of TKA and THA (combined and separate) were plotted and assessed by age. To assess factors associated with who ""delayed"" surgery until 65 years, demographic and preoperative characteristics, and postoperative adverse events were compared for the 2 years above and the 2 years below the 65-year-old mark with multivariate analysis. Significance was set at P < 0.05. RESULTS: In total, 515,139 TKA and THA patients were identified (62.04% TKA and 37.95% THA). When the number of procedures was plotted by age, a discontinuity in the bell-shaped curve was noted at age 65 years. Highlighting this finding, the changes in percent population between 63 and 64 years was -1.52%, between 64 and 65 years was +15.36%, and between 65 and 66 years was -2.32%. Relative to those who were 63 and 64 years (n = 36,511), those who were 65 and 66 years (n = 41,671) were more likely to be female, be non-Hispanic White, have a lower body mass index, and have a lower functional status but were not different in the preoperative American Society of Anesthesiologists class. CONCLUSION: In this large national sample, there was a clear step increase in undergoing TKA or THA once patients reached the age of 65 years (Medicare eligibility). This discontinuity in the bell-shaped curve may be evidence for a moral hazard in healthcare markets.

I.",The Association Between Preoperative Independent Ambulatory Status and Outcomes After Open Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repairs,"BACKGROUND: Preoperative functional status is appreciated as a key determinant of decision-making when evaluating patients for complex elective surgeries. We used the Vascular Quality Initiative to analyze the effect of being able to independently ambulate on outcomes after open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repairs. METHODS: We identified all patients who underwent elective or urgent open AAA repairs from January 2013 to August 2019 in the Vascular Quality Initiative registry. We recorded demographic variables, comorbidities, and operative factors such as approach, operative ischemia time, proximal clamp site, and presence of iliac aneurysms. Short-term and long-term outcomes included 30-day mortality, any perioperative complications, failure to rescue (defined as death after a complication), and 1-year all-cause mortality. We dichotomized patients based on their ability to independently ambulate (Ambulatory) or inability to ambulate independently (Non-Ambulatory) and used both multivariable logistic regressions and cox-proportional hazards models to evaluate outcomes. RESULTS: Of 5,371 patients, 328 (6.1%) could not ambulate independently and were more likely to be older (median age 69 vs. 72), female (25% vs. 38%), and have greater comorbidities. Overall outcomes were: 4.3% for 30-day mortality, 38.7% for complications, 10.2% for failure-to-rescue, and 6.9% for 1-year mortality. Univariate analysis showed higher rates of all adverse outcomes in non-ambulatory patients. On adjusted analysis, non-ambulatory patients had increased odds of complications by 46% (OR 1.46 [95%-CI 1.11-1.91]) and 1-year mortality by 46% (HR 1.46 [95%-CI 1.06-1.99]), but not failure to rescue (OR 1.05 [95%-CI 0.67-1.62]) or 30-day mortality (OR 1.22 [95%-CI 0.82-1.81]). Increased hospital volume, age, and increased operative renal ischemia time were independently associated with adverse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Non-ambulatory status was observed in a small percentage of patients undergoing open AAA repair but was associated with higher rates of post-operative complications and 1-year mortality. Ambulatory capacity is one of the key determinants of outcomes following open AAA repair. In patients with poor ambulatory function, a conservative approach is highly recommended over invasive open surgical intervention.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 10828,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Limited orthopedic literature examines the influence that dementia has on patients undergoing elective spinal surgeries. METHODS: Employing the PearlDriver Database, a study population consisting of patients who underwent primary elective ACDF with a prior diagnosis of dementia were selected using Internal Classification Disease-9 (ICD) and ICD-10 codes. Patients with a history of trauma, infection, or malignancy were excluded. Patients with dementia were compared to matched controls via logistical regression accounting for patient demographics, medical comorbidities and levels operated on. Patients were assessed for 90-day outcomes including medical complications, emergency department visits, readmissions, one-year reoperation, hospital length of stay (LOS) and total operative hospitalization costs, and 90-day postoperative cost. RESULTS: There were 4104 patients in the dementia group and 20,269 patients in the matched control group who underwent primary ACDF. Multivariate analysis showed that patients with dementia undergoing ACDF were associated with increased 90-day major and minor medical complications (p < 0.001). Patients with dementia were also associated with an increased risk of dysphagia (p < 0.001), 90-day ER visits(p < 0.001), 90-day readmissions(p < 0.001), and increased LOS(p < 0.001) following ACDF compared to the control group.

METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of female Medicare beneficiaries ≥65 years of age undergoing POP surgery between 2014 and 2016. Primary outcomes were hospital length-of-stay (LOS) ≥3 days, 30-day post-operative complications (excluding urinary tract infections (UTI)), and 30-day UTI. Frailty was quantified using the validated Claims-Based Frailty Index (CFI) and categorized into not frail (CFI<0.15), pre-frail (0.15≤CFI<0.25), mildly frail (0.25≤CFI<0.35), and moderately to severely frail (0.35≤CFI≤1). RESULTS: Among the 107,890 women included (mean age, 73.3±6 years), 91.3% were White as and 4.3% were classified as mildly or moderately to severely frail. Rates of hospital LOS≥3 days and 30-day UTI increased over 7-fold and rates of 30-day complications increased over 3-fold as CFI increased from not frail to moderately to severely frail (all P values <.001). Compared to women who were not frail, women who were moderately to severely frail demonstrated an increased relative risk of hospital LOS≥3 days (aRR 3.1 [95% CI 2.5-3.8,P <.001]), 30-day complications (aRR 2.8 [95% CI 2.2-3.6, P <.001]), and 30-day UTI (aRR 2.5 [95% CI 2.2-3.0, P <.001]). CONCLUSION: Among Medicare beneficiaries undergoing POP surgery in the United States, frailty is strongly associated with increased risk of prolonged hospital stay and 30-day complications.

Knowledge about the course of physical fitness during neoadjuvant therapy and esophagectomy is helpful to determine the needs for interventions during and after curative treatment. This study aims to review the current evidence on the impact of curative treatment on the physical fitness of patients with esophageal cancer. METHODS: A systematic literature search of PubMed, Embase, Cinahl and the Cochrane Library was conducted up to March 29, 2021. We included observational studies investigating the change of physical fitness (including exercise capacity, muscle strength, physical activity and activities of daily living) from pre-to post-neoadjuvant therapy and/or from pre-to post-esophagectomy. Quality of the studies was assessed and a meta-analysis was performed using standardized mean differences. RESULTS: Twenty-seven articles were included. After neoadjuvant therapy, physical fitness decreased significantly. In the first three months after surgery, physical fitness was also significantly decreased compared to preoperative values. Subgroup analysis showed a restore in exercise capacity three months after surgery in patients who followed an exercise program. Six months after surgery, there was limited evidence that exercise capacity restored to preoperative values. CONCLUSION: Curative treatment seems to result in a decrease of physical fitness in patients with esophageal cancer, up to three months postoperatively. Six months postoperatively, results were conflicting. In patients who followed a pre- or postoperative exercise program, the postoperative impact of curative treatment seems to be less.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 10347,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Addressing these concerns requires evaluating the effect of preoperative activity level on patient-reported outcomes and improvement following THA. Methods: Three hundred thirty-five patients (368 hips) who underwent THA with a minimum 6-month (mean 533 ± 271 days) follow-up completed preoperative and postoperative University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) activity score along with various patient-reported measures of function, pain, and mental state. Preoperative UCLA score divided patients into inactive, mild, and active groups. Analysis of covariance controlling for age, sex, body mass index, surgical approach, implant, bilateral cases, conversions, and follow-up time evaluated differences among groups for postoperative outcomes with subsequent Tukey-Kramer pairwise comparisons. Results: Mildly active patients (73:139 male:female) had better postoperative outcomes than inactive patients (40:70 male:female) for UCLA score, EuroQol Visual Analog Scale (EQVAS), Hip Outcome Score (HOS), 12-item Short-Form (SF-12) Physical, and Visual Analog Pain Scale (average/now/worst) (P values <0.001/<0.001/<0.001/<0.001/0.003/<0.001/<0.001). Active patients (32:14 male:female) had better postoperative outcomes than inactive patients for UCLA score, EQVAS, HOS, SF-12 Physical, and Visual Analog Pain Scale Worst (P values <0.001/0.024/0.001/0.001/0.017). No postoperative outcome differences existed between active and mild patients. Inactive patients displayed greater outcome improvements than mildly active patients for UCLA score, Harris Hip Score, and International Hip Outcome Tool (P values <0.001/<0.001/0.013) and active patients for UCLA score, EQVAS, HOS, International Hip Outcome Tool, and SF-12 Physical (P values <0.001/0.008/0.013/0.022/0.004). Conclusions: Inactive patients achieve greater measure improvements following THA. Active patients achieve better absolute outcomes than inactive patients; however, increasing activity levels do not incrementally improve patient-reported outcome measures.

Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), as a form of cognitive dysfunction, may affect patients' short- and long-term recoveries. The identification of meaningful risk factors may help reduce the occurrence of POCD in the future. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to retrospectively investigate the risk factors for early POCD in elderly patients undergoing TKA and to further analyze the relationship between the intensity of risk factors and the level of cognitive function. METHODS: The related indicators and the Montreal Cognitive Function Assessment Scale (MOCA) scores of 105 elderly patients were collected by searching the electronic case system. According to the postoperative MOCA score, patients were divided into three groups: normal group (group N), mild POCD group (group M), and severe POCD group (group S). SPSS 25.0 software was used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: At baseline, the preoperative MOCA score was significantly different in patients with POCD (P ≤ 0.001), while other baseline indicators were not significantly different. In terms of changes in hemoglobin levels, statistically significant differences were observed between group M, group S, and group N (P = 0.039). Among inflammatory indicators, only postoperative CRP levels showed a statistically significant difference in patients with POCD (P = 0.041). Postoperative pain was also significantly different among the three groups (P = 0.009). The multivariate regression analysis revealed that a low preoperative MOCA score and severe postoperative pain were independent risk factors for mild and severe cognitive impairment, while a high postoperative CRP level was only an independent risk factor for mild cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that the level of preoperative cognitive function, postoperative CRP level, and postoperative pain were independent risk factors for POCD. Moreover, the levels of preoperative cognitive function and postoperative pain were more strongly correlated with severe POCD than postoperative CRP levels.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 8788,Search update 2023-11-13,,

We investigated whether combined intraoperative nociception (NOL index) and anaesthesia (BIS index) monitoring during general anaesthesia would reduce anaesthetics consumption and enhance intraoperative safety and postoperative recovery when compared to standard of care monitoring (SOC). METHODS: In this randomised study, we included 60 patients undergoing colonic surgery under desflurane/remifentanil anaesthesia and epidural analgesia. Patients received either standard monitoring or combined BIS + NOL index monitoring. In the monitored group, remifentanil infusion was titrated to achieve a NOL index below 20. Desflurane was adjusted to BIS values (45-55). In the SOC group, remifentanil and desflurane were titrated on vital signs and MAC. The primary outcome was intraoperative desflurane consumption. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients were analysed. Desflurane administration was reduced in the monitored group from 0.25 ± 0.05 to 0.20 ± 0.06 mL kg(-1) h(-1) (p < 0.001). The cumulative time with a BIS under 40 was significantly higher in the SOC group with a median time of 12.6 min (95% CI: 0.6-80.0) versus 2.0 min (95% CI: 0.3-5.83) (p = 0.023). Time for extubation was significantly shorter in the monitored group: 4.4 min (95% CI: 2.4-4.9) versus 6.28 min (95% IC: 5.0-8.2) (p = 0.003). We observed no differences in remifentanil or phenylephrine requirements during anaesthesia or in postoperative outcome measures, such as postoperative pain, opioid consumption, neurocognitive recovery. CONCLUSION: Combined intraoperative monitoring of anaesthesia and nociception during colonic surgery resulted in less desflurane consumption and quicker extubation time compared to standard clinical care monitoring.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16860,Search update 2023-11-13,,

C.",The Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index Predicts Postoperative Outcomes in Bladder Cancer: A Propensity Score-Matched Analysis,"PURPOSE: The Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) is a simple screening tool to predict nutrition-related risk of morbidity and mortality in older patients. We assessed whether preoperative GNRI was associated with 30-day complications after radical cystectomy (RC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database, we identified patients 65 years or older who underwent RC for the treatment of bladder cancer between 2007 and 2019. Patients were dichotomized into at-risk (GNRI ≤98) or no-risk (GNRI >98) groups. Using propensity score matching, the 2 groups were compared for baseline differences and 30-day outcomes. We evaluated GNRI as an independent predictor of postoperative complications using multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: We identified 2,926 patients eligible for analysis. After propensity score matching, patients in the at-risk GNRI group had higher rates of any complication (p=0.017), blood transfusion (p=0.002), extended length of stay (p=0.004) and nonhome discharge (p <0.001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that a decreasing GNRI is an independent prognostic factor for mortality (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.08, p=0.009), blood transfusion (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02-1.04, p <0.001), pneumonia (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.07, p=0.013), extended length of stay (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02-1.05, p <0.001) and nonhome discharge (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.03-1.06, p <0.001).

G.",Effect of Perioperative Opioid Use on Patients Undergoing Hip Arthroscopy,"Background: Opioids are commonly used to treat postoperative pain; however, guidelines vary regarding safe opioid use after hip arthroscopy. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purposes were to (1) identify risk factors for persistent opioid use, (2) assess the effect of opioid use on outcomes, and (3) describe common opioid prescribing patterns after hip arthroscopy. It was hypothesized that preoperative opioid use would affect complication rates and result in greater postoperative opioid use. Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence 3. Methods: The Utah State All Payer Claims Database was queried for patients who underwent hip arthroscopy between January 2013 and December 2017. Included were patients ≥14 years of age at index surgery with continuous insurance. Patients were separated into acute (<3 months) and chronic (≥3 months) postoperative opioid use groups. Primary outcomes included revision surgery, complications (infection, pulmonary embolism/deep venous thrombosis, death), emergency department (ED) visits, and hospital admissions. Multivariate logistic regression was utilized to identify factors associated with the outcomes. Results: Included were 2835 patients (mean age, 47 years; range, 14-64 years), of whom 2544 were in the acute opioid use and 291 were in the chronic opioid use group. Notably, 91% of the patients in the chronic group took opioid medications preoperatively, and they were more than twice as likely to carry a mental health diagnosis (P <.01). Patients in the acute group had a significantly shorter initial prescription duration, took fewer opioid pills, and had fewer refills than those in the chronic group (P <.01 for all). Patients in the chronic group had a significantly higher risk of postoperative ED visits (odds ratio [OR], 2.76; P =.008), hospital admission (OR, 3.02; P =.002), and additional surgery (P =.003), as well as infection (OR, 2.55; P <.001) and hematoma (OR, 2.43; P =.030). Patients who had used opioids before hip arthroscopy were more likely to need more refills (P <.01). A formal opioid use disorder diagnosis correlated significantly with postoperative hospital admissions (OR, 3.83; P =.044) and revision hip arthroscopy (OR, 4.72; P =.003). Conclusion: Mental health and substance use disorders were more common in patients with chronic postoperative opioid use, and chronic postoperative opioid use was associated with greater likelihood of postoperative complications. Preoperative opioid use was significantly correlated with chronic postoperative opioid use and with increased refill requests after index arthroscopy. © The Author(s) 2022.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16448,Search update 2023-11-13,,

M., Spies, C., Koch, S.",Machine-learning model predicting postoperative delirium in older patients using intraoperative frontal electroencephalographic signatures,"Objective: In older patients receiving general anesthesia, postoperative delirium (POD) is the most frequent form of cerebral dysfunction. Early identification of patients at higher risk to develop POD could provide the opportunity to adapt intraoperative and postoperative therapy. We, therefore, propose a machine learning approach to predict the risk of POD in elderly patients, using routine intraoperative electroencephalography (EEG) and clinical data that are readily available in the operating room. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the data of a single-center study at the Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Department of Anesthesiology [ISRCTN 36437985], including 1,277 patients, older than 60 years with planned surgery and general anesthesia. To deal with the class imbalance, we used balanced ensemble methods, specifically Bagging and Random Forests and as a performance measure, the area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC). We trained our models including basic clinical parameters and intraoperative EEG features in particular classical spectral and burst suppression signatures as well as multi-band covariance matrices, which were classified, taking advantage of the geometry of a Riemannian manifold. The models were validated with 10 repeats of a 10-fold cross-validation. Results: Including EEG data in the classification resulted in a robust and reliable risk evaluation for POD. The clinical parameters alone achieved an AUC-ROC score of 0.75. Including EEG signatures improved the classification when the patients were grouped by anesthetic agents and evaluated separately for each group. The spectral features alone showed an AUC-ROC score of 0.66; the covariance features showed an AUC-ROC score of 0.68. The AUC-ROC scores of EEG features relative to patient data differed by anesthetic group. The best performance was reached, combining both the EEG features and the clinical parameters. Overall, the AUC-ROC score was 0.77, for patients receiving Propofol it was 0.78, for those receiving Sevoflurane it was 0.8 and for those receiving Desflurane 0.73. Applying the trained prediction model to an independent data set of a different clinical study confirmed these results for the combined classification, while the classifier on clinical parameters alone did not generalize. Conclusion: A machine learning approach combining intraoperative frontal EEG signatures with clinical parameters could be an easily applicable tool to early identify patients at risk to develop POD.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16815,Search update 2023-11-13,,

BACKGROUND: Frailty predicts clinical events in orthopaedic patients aged over 65. However, the strengths and limitations of different approaches to measuring frailty in this population are rarely discussed. As such, a comprehensive review to address the gap is needed. DESIGN: Scoping review using Arksey and O'Malley framework. METHODS: PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus and EMBASE databases were searched to identify studies published from 2006 to 2020 regarding frailty instruments in older orthopaedic patients. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses were followed. RESULTS: The initial search resulted in 1,471 articles. After review against inclusion and exclusion criteria, a final set of 31 articles containing 15 unique frailty instruments were evaluated. Most of the articles were from Western countries. Fried's phenotype and Frailty Index were commonly used. The frailty index was mostly modified to measure frailty. In hip fracture, physical function items were frequently modified in the measurement of frailty. Trained physicians and nurses administered most frailty instruments. Frailty screening was commonly conducted at hospital admission and used to prognosticate both postoperative complications and hospital outcomes. Most instruments could be completed within 10 min. Reported psychometrics had acceptable reliability and validity. CONCLUSION: Many reliable frailty measures have been used in the inpatient orthopaedic settings; however, evidence is still lacking for a gold standard frailty instrument. More research is needed to identify the best-performing measure. Frailty evaluation in patients with physical limitations is challenging with existing instruments. Clinical context, resources required and instrument quality are essential factors in selecting a frailty instrument. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Musculoskeletal symptoms in older patients may bias frailty assessment. Proactive frailty screening with valid and practical instruments is vital to strengthen preoperative risk stratification and improve post-surgical outcomes.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 5229,Search update 2023-11-13,,

METHODS: Within the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database we identified 25,545 patients treated with PN from 2000 to 2015. We used the Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups (ACG) frailty-defining indicator and we examined the rates of frailty over time, as well as its effect on overall complications, major complications, blood transfusions, non-home-based discharge, length of stay (LOS) and THCs. Time trends and multivariable logistic, Poisson and linear regression models were applied. RESULTS: Overall, 3574 (14.0%) patients were frail, 2677 (10.5%) were older than 75 years and 2888 (11.3%) had Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) ≥ 2. However, the vast majority of frail patients were neither elderly nor comorbid (83%). Rates of frail patients treated with PN increased over time, from 8.3 in 2000 to 18.1% in 2015 (all p &lt; 0.001). Frail patients showed higher rates of overall complications (43.5 vs. 30.3%), major complications (16.6 vs. 9.8%), blood transfusions (11.6 vs 8.3%) and non-home-based discharge (9.9 vs. 5.4%). longer LOS [4 (IQR: 3-6) vs. 4 (IQR: 2-5) days] and higher THCs ($43,906 vs. $38,447 - all p &lt; 0.001). Moreover, frailty status independently predicted overall complications (OR: 1.73), major complications (OR: 1.63), longer LOS (RR: 1.07) and higher THCs (RR: +$7506). Finally, a dose-response on the risk of suboptimal surgical outcomes was shown in patients with multiple risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: One out of seven patients is frail at time of surgery and this rate is on the rise. Moreover, frailty is associated with adverse outcomes after PN. In consequence, preoperative assessment of frailty status should be implemented, to identify patients who may benefit from pre- or postoperative measures aimed at improving surgical outcomes in this patient population.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 10886,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Geriatric patients, patients undergoing cardiac surgery, and intensive care patients are at a high risk of developing postoperative delirium. Gold standard assessments or biomarkers to predict risk factors for delirium, cognitive decline, and dementia in patients undergoing cardiac surgery are not yet available. METHODS: The FINDERI trial (FINd DElirium RIsk factors) is a prospective, single-center, observational study. In total, 500 patients aged ≥ 50 years undergoing cardiac surgery at the Department of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery of the University of Göttingen Medical Center will be recruited. Our primary aim is to validate a delirium risk assessment in context of cardiac surgery. Our secondary aims are to identify specific preoperative and perioperative factors associated with delirium, cognitive decline, and accelerated dementia after cardiac surgery, and to identify blood-based biomarkers that predict the incidence of postoperative delirium, cognitive decline, or dementia in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. DISCUSSION: This prospective, observational study might help to identify patients at high risk for delirium prior to cardiac surgery, and to identify important biological mechanisms by which cardiac surgery is associated with delirium. The predictive value of a delirium screening questionnaire in cardiac surgery might be revealed. Finally, the identification of specific blood biomarkers might help to predict delirium, cognitive decline, and dementia in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

To date it is unknown if a specific anesthetic regime can affect the incidence of delirium after surgery. Our objective was to examine the effect of volatile anesthetics on post-operative delirium. DESIGN: Single Center Observational Study. SETTING: Post Anesthesia Care Units at a German tertiary medical center. PATIENTS: 30,075 patients receiving general anesthesia for surgery. MEASUREMENTS: Delirium was assessed with the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale at the end of the recovery period. Subgroup-specific effects of volatile anesthetics on post-operative delirium were estimated using generalized-linear-model trees with inverse probability of treatment weighting. We further assessed the age-specific effect of volatiles using logistic regression models. MAIN RESULTS: Out of 30,075 records, 956 patients (3.2%) developed delirium in the post anesthesia care unit. On average, patients who developed delirium were older than patients without delirium. We found volatile anesthetics to increase the risk (Odds exp. (B) for delirium in the elderly 1.8-fold compared to total intravenous anesthesia. Odds increases with unplanned surgery 3.0-fold. In the very old (87 years or older), the increase in delirium is 6.2-fold. This result was confirmed with internal validation and in a logistic regression model. CONCLUSIONS: Our exploratory study indicates that early postoperative delirium is associated with the use of volatile anesthetics especially in the sub-cohort of patients aged 75 years and above.

We sought to determine whether smoking status is independently associated with delirium and pain outcomes. METHODS: This was a prospective, observational cohort study of 442 older adults (65 to 90 years) admitted for traumatic hip fracture at five trauma centers. The primary exposure was smoking status (n = 43, 10%). Additional risk factors included demographics, injury characteristics, and medical interventions. Delirium (primary) and analgesia-related complications were examined with multivariable logistic regression, while analysis of covariance models were used to examine preoperative and postoperative pain scores and opioid consumption (oral morphine equivalents). RESULTS: Smokers had significantly worse outcomes compared with nonsmokers: delirium incidence was 16.3% versus 5.0% (adjusted odds ratio, 4.23; P = 0.005), analgesia complications developed in 30.2% versus 14.8% (adjusted odds ratio, 2.63; P = 0.01), and postoperative opioid consumption was greater (53 mg versus 33 mg, adjusted P = 0.04). Adjusted pain scores were not different between groups. DISCUSSION: Smoking status is associated with markedly worse outcomes in older adults with traumatic hip fracture.

(Pre-)frailty is present in up to 42% of the older surgical population, with an increased risk for peri- and postoperative complications. Consequently, these patients often suffer from a delayed or limited recovery, loss of autonomy and quality of life, and a decrease in functional and cognitive capacities. Since frailty is modifiable, prehabilitation may improve the physiological reserves of patients and reduce the care dependency 12 months after surgery. METHODS: Patients ≥ 70 years old scheduled for elective surgery or intervention will be recruited in this multicenter, randomized controlled study, with a target of 1400 participants with an allocation ratio of 1:1. The intervention consists of (1) a shared decision-making process with the patient, relatives, and an interdisciplinary and interprofessional team and (2) a 3-week multimodal, individualized prehabilitation program including exercise therapy, nutritional intervention, mobility or balance training, and psychosocial interventions and medical assessment. The frequency of the supervised prehabilitation is 5 times/week for 3 weeks. The primary endpoint is defined as the level of care dependency 12 months after surgery or intervention. DISCUSSION: Prehabilitation has been proven to be effective for different populations, including colorectal, transplant, and cardiac surgery patients. In contrast, evidence for prehabilitation in older, frail patients has not been clearly established. To the best of our knowledge, this is currently the largest prehabilitation study on older people with frailty undergoing general elective surgery.

M.",Development of a Preoperative Clinical Risk Assessment Tool for Postoperative Complications After Hysterectomy,"Study Objective: To develop a preoperative risk assessment tool that quantifies the risk of postoperative complications within 30 days of hysterectomy. Design: Retrospective analysis. Setting: Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative hospitals. Patients: Women who underwent hysterectomy for gynecologic indications. Interventions: Development of a nomogram to create a clinical risk assessment tool. Measurements and Main Results: Postoperative complications within 30 days were the primary outcome. Bivariate analysis was performed comparing women who had a complication and those who did not. The patient registry was randomly divided. A logistic regression model developed and validated from the Collaborative database was externally validated with hysterectomy cases from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, and a nomogram was developed to create a clinical risk assessment tool. Of the 41,147 included women, the overall postoperative complication rate was 3.98% (n = 1638). Preoperative factors associated with postoperative complications were sepsis (odds ratio [OR] 7.98; confidence interval [CI], 1.98–32.20), abdominal approach (OR 2.27; 95% CI, 1.70–3.05), dependent functional status (OR 2.20; 95% CI, 1.34–3.62), bleeding disorder (OR 2.10; 95% CI, 1.37–3.21), diabetes with HbA1c ≥9% (OR 1.93; 95% CI, 1.16–3.24), gynecologic cancer (OR 1.86; 95% CI, 1.49–2.31), blood transfusion (OR 1.84; 95% CI, 1.15–2.96), American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System class ≥3 (OR 1.46; 95% CI, 1.24–1.73), government insurance (OR 1.3; 95% CI, 1.40–1.90), and body mass index ≥40 (OR 1.25; 95% CI, 1.04–1.50). Model discrimination was consistent in the derivation, internal validation, and external validation cohorts (C-statistics 0.68, 0.69, 0.68, respectively). Conclusion: We validated a preoperative clinical risk assessment tool to predict postoperative complications within 30 days of hysterectomy. Modifiable risk factors identified were preoperative blood transfusion, poor glycemic control, and open abdominal surgery. © 2021 AAGL",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16457,Search update 2023-11-13,,

T., Burg, M. M., Mathis, M., Kheterpal, S., Akhtar, S., Shah, N., Bardia, A.",Association of propofol induction dose and severe pre-incision hypotension among surgical patients over age 65,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: We aimed to study the association between propofol induction dose (mg/kg) and pre-incision severe hypotension (Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) ≤ 55 mmHg) among patients ≥65 years of age. DESIGN: Retrospective Observational. SETTING: 40 centers participating in the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group consortium. PATIENTS: Patients ≥65 years of age undergoing non-cardiac, non-vascular surgery who received propofol for general anesthetic induction prior to endotracheal intubation between January 2014 and December 2018. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS: The primary exposure was total propofol induction dose in mg/kg, and the primary outcome was occurrence of severe hypotension (MAP≤55 mmHg) prior to surgical incision, stratified by non-invasive vs. invasive blood pressure monitoring type. MAIN RESULTS: Among 320,585 total patients, 22.6% experienced the outcome of pre-incision severe hypotension (MAP≤55 mmHg). When stratified by blood pressure monitoring type, 20.7% with non-invasive blood pressure measurements, and 35.0% with invasive blood pressure measurements had the outcome. After controlling for a variety of patient and procedural factors, there was a significant independent association between propofol induction dose and pre-incision hypotension (Non-invasive blood pressure cohort odds ratio (OR) 1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 1.13; p < 0.001; and Invasive blood pressure cohort OR 1.15; 95%CI 1.10 to 1.21; adjusted p < 0.001). The association was robust to alternative definitions of the outcome, including less severe hypotension (MAP≤65 mmHg) and blood pressure drop from baseline as a continuous measure. Although no threshold safe induction dose was identified at which hypotension was avoided, an analysis of propofol dose greater or less than 1.5 mg/kg (i.e. the maximum FDA-defined typical induction dose) demonstrated that doses in excess of the FDAs threshold were positively associated with odds of severe hypotension (Non-invasive cohort: OR 1.05; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.08; p < 0.001; Invasive cohort: OR 1.11; 95%CI 1.05 to 1.17; adjusted p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In a multicenter cohort of geriatric surgical patients receiving propofol for general anesthetic induction and endotracheal intubation, severe pre-incision hypotension (MAP ≤55 mmHg) that has previously been associated with postoperative morbidity was common. The dose of propofol used was significantly associated with increased odds of this outcome after controlling for a number of clinically relevant factors. Future studies that are designed to test different approaches to anesthesia induction for reducing severe post induction pre-incision hypotension are warranted.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 7278,Search update 2023-11-13,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cardiac surgery was performed in 218 patients (mean age 72 years). Preoperative evaluation involved AQT, MMSE and Hospital Anxiety And Depression Scale (HADS). Postoperative delirium was assessed using Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (Nu-DESC) and Confusion Assessment Method-ICU (CAM-ICU). Logistic regression was performed to detect predictors of postoperative delirium and receiver operator characteristic curves (ROC) with area under the curve (AUC) to determine the accuracy. RESULTS: Postoperative delirium occurred in 47 patients (22%) who had lower MMSE scores (median (range), 27 (19-30) vs 28 (20-30), p=0.009) and slower AQT (median (range), 76 (48-181) vs 70 (40-182) seconds, p=0.030) than patients without delirium. Predictive power measured as AUC (95% CI) was 0.605 (0.51-0.70) for AQT and 0.623 (0.53-0.72) for MMSE. Logistic regression (OR, 95% CI) showed MMSE <27 points (2.72, 1.27-5.86), AQT >70 sec (2.26, 1.03-4.95), HADS-D >4 points (2.60, 1.21-5.58) and longer cardiopulmonary bypass-time (1.007, 1.002-1.013) to be associated with postoperative delirium. Combining these parameters yielded an AUC of 0.736 (0.65-0.82). CONCLUSION: The ability of predicting delirium using AQT was similar to MMSE, and only slightly higher by combining AQT and MMSE. Adding HADS-D and cardiopulmonary bypass-time to MMSE and AQT increased the predictive power to a borderline acceptable discriminatory value. Preoperative cognitive tests and screening for depressive symptoms may help identify patients at risk of postoperative delirium. Yet, there is still a need to establish useful preoperative tests.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16950,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Cognitive status is important for operative management, especially in elderly populations. This study aims to investigate preoperative and postoperative cognitive function assessment tools in geriatric patients following acute trauma and associated outcomes, including functional status, postdischarge disposition, mortality, and hospital length of stay (H-LOS). METHODS: A literature search was conducted using Medline/PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, JAMA Networks, and Cochrane databases for studies investigating the use of cognitive assessment tools for geriatric patients with acute trauma. The last literature search was conducted on November 13, 2021. RESULTS: Ten studies were included in this review, of which five focused on preoperative cognitive assessment and five focused on postoperative. The evidence suggests patients with preoperative cognitive impairment had worse functional status, mortality, and postdischarge disposition along with increased LOS. Acute trauma patients with postoperative cognitive impairment also had worse functional status, mortality, and adverse postdischarge disposition. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative and postoperative cognitive impairment is common in geriatric patients with acute trauma and is associated with worse outcomes, including decreased functional status, increased LOS, and adverse discharge disposition. Cognitive assessment tools such as MMSE, MoCA, and CAM are fast and effective at detecting cognitive impairment in the acute trauma setting and allow clinicians to address preoperative or postoperative cognitive impairments to improve patient outcomes.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 7000,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Melatonin has been suggested as a low-risk pharmacological intervention to help prevent POD. A previous systematic review found limited high-quality evidence to support the use of melatonin in the prevention of POD. Several further randomised studies have since been published. This systematic review aims to synthesise the evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining the effect of melatonin on the prevention of POD in older adults. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A systematic search of RCTs of melatonin (any dose and formulation) in POD will be run across Embase, Medline, CINAHL and PsychInfo. RCTs published from January 1990 until the end of February 2022 and reporting outcomes for melatonin use to prevent POD in patients will be included. Screening of search results and data extraction from included articles will be performed by two independent reviewers. The primary outcome will be incidence of POD in older adults undergoing surgery. Secondary outcomes are delirium duration and length of hospital stay. The review will also describe the dosage, timing and administration regimes of melatonin therapy and as well as the scales and definitions used to describe POD. A registry review of ongoing trials will be also be performed. For the meta-analysis, data will be pooled using a random effects model to generate a forest plot and obtain an odds ratio (OR) for the incidence of POD. Results will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No ethical approval is required. This review will be disseminated via peer-reviewed manuscript and conferences. The results will be used as the basis of work to optimise this intervention for future trials in surgical populations.

This study hence aimed to investigate the effects of general anesthesia with isoflurane and propofol on the quality of recovery (QoR) in patients undergoing an abdominal hysterectomy. METHODS: This clinical trial was conducted on 80 women aged 30-65 years who visited Ayatollah Rouhani Hospital of Babol for an elective abdominal hysterectomy in 2020. Based on a randomized block design (4 blocks of 20), the participants were equally assigned to two groups of propofol (P) and isoflurane (I). The QoR-15 scale was employed to measure the QoR in terms of physical and mental dimensions, as primary outcomes, and duration of anesthesia, duration of surgery, response time, quality of extubation, changes in blood pressure and heart rate, length of stay in the recovery unit, Aldrete score, pain score, and prevalence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: The results showed that there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of postoperative physical and mental changes (P = 0.142), except for the second night after surgery (P = 0.001). The QoR, both physically and mentally, significantly changed in both groups over time (P ＜ 0.05). The results also indicated that response time (P ＜ 0.001), quality of extubation (P = 0.01), prevalence of PONV (P = 0.001), and increase in blood pressure (P = 0.02) were significantly lower in the propofol group (P) than in the isoflurane group (I). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the length of stay in the recovery unit (P = 0.44), pre-discharge Aldrete score (P = 0.31), pain score (P = 0.18), duration of anesthesia (P = 0.30), duration of surgery (P = 0.64), and heart rate (P = 0.30). CONCLUSIONS: Propofol outperformed isoflurane in terms of response time, quality of extubation, prevalence of PONV, and increase in blood pressure.

The present study was done to compare the efficacy of dexmedetomidine nebulization with intravenous dexmedetomidine and fentanyl in laparoscopic surgeries under general anesthesia. METHODS: A prospective, double blind study was conducted, and 90 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I and II patients of either gender between 18-65 years undergoing laparoscopic surgeries under general anesthesia were randomized into three groups. (1) Group N (n = 30) received dexmedetomidine nebulization 1 mcg/kg in 3 mL of 0.9% saline 15 minutes before induction and 10 mL of intravenous 0.9% saline over 10 minutes at the time of induction of anesthesia. (2) Group I (n = 30) received 0.9% saline nebulization 3 mL and intravenous dexmedetomidine 1 mcg/kg in 10 mL of 0.9% saline. (3) Group F (n = 30) received 0.9% saline nebulization 3 mL and intravenous fentanyl 2 mcg/kg in 10mL of 0.9% saline. Heart rate, blood pressure, propofol requirement, and opioid consumption were monitored throughout surgery and for 1 hour in post-operative period. Statistical analysis was done by using analysis of variance test, chi-square test. P value ＜ 0.05 was considered signifi cant. RESULTS: Suppression of hemodynamic response following intubation and pneumoperitoneum by dexmedetomidine nebulization was compared to intravenous dexmedetomidine and fentanyl. Opioid requirement was significantly lower in dexmedetomidine group than fentanyl group (P ＜ 0.05). Propofol requirement was lower with intravenous and nebulized dexmedetomidine than intravenous fentanyl.

Frailty is a strong predictor of adverse outcomes in surgical patients. Our objective is to systematically review the association of frailty with postoperative mortality and other adverse outcomes in adult patients who have undergone nonemergency cancer surgery. METHODS: After registration (CRD42020171163), we systematically reviewed PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases to identify all studies reporting an association between a preoperative frailty measurement and a relevant outcome (primary: all-cause mortality in-hospital or within 30 days of surgery; secondary outcomes: postoperative complications, length of stay, discharge disposition, mortality between 30 days and 1 year, postoperative function, and delirium). All stages of the review were completed in duplicate. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality in Prognostic Studies (QUIPS) tool. Metaanalysis was used to pool effect estimates using random-effects models. RESULTS: A total of 2877 studies were identified, and 71 were included. Frailty was significantly associated with mortality within 30 days (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 3.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.77-5.15), adverse discharge disposition (adjusted OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.52-3.02), postoperative complications (adjusted OR 2.39, 95% CI 1.64-3.49), longer-term mortality (unadjusted OR 4.32, 95% CI 2.15-8.67), and length of stay (mean difference 2.30, 95% CI 1.10-3.50). The number of studies presenting adequately adjusted estimates was small. Findings may be limited due to publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: In adults having elective cancer surgery, frailty is strongly associated with adverse health outcomes.

Design: Retrospective analysis of data collected from a randomized study. Setting: Tertiary care university hospital. Participants: A total of 436 patients age ≥55 years undergoing cardiac surgery. Intervention: None. Measurements and Main Results: Neuropsychological testing was performed before and one month after surgery, using a standard battery. Individual Z-scores calculated from the mean and standard deviation of tests at baseline were combined into domain-specific scores. Anemia (hemoglobin <130 g/L for men, <120 g/L for women) was present in 41% of patients. Preoperative anemia had little impact on preoperative cognition. There were no differences in the change in cognitive performance one month after surgery from baseline between patients with and without preoperative anemia. However, in a sensitivity analysis using multiple imputation for missing cognitive test scores, significant associations were observed between preoperative anemia and change in postoperative processing speed (p = 0.016), change in executive function (p = 0.049), and change in fine motor speed (p = 0.016). Nadir hemoglobin during cardiopulmonary bypass, which was lower in anemic than nonanemic patients, was associated with decrements in performance on tests of verbal fluency (p = 0.007), processing speed (p = 0.042), and executive function (p = 0.10) one month after surgery but not delayed neurocognitive recovery (p = 0.06).

It has been reported that the incidence of postoperative neurocognitive impairment after noncardiac surgery in patients older than 65 at 1 week was 25.8∼41.4%, and at 3 months 9.9∼12.7%. PNDs will last months or even develop to permanent dementia, leading to prolonged hospital stays, reduced quality of life, and increased mortality within 1 year. Despite the high incidence and poor prognosis of PNDs in the aged population, no effective clinical prediction model has been established to predict postoperative cognitive decline preoperatively. To develop a clinical prediction model for postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction, a prospective observational study (Clinical trial registration number: ChiCTR2000036304) will be performed in the Shanghai General Hospital during January 2021 to October 2022. A sample size of 675 patients aged >65 years old, male or female, and scheduled for elective major noncardiac surgery will be recruited. A battery of neuropsychological tests will be used to test the cognitive function of patients at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months postoperatively. We will evaluate the associations of PNDs with a bunch of candidate predictors including general characteristics of patients, blood biomarkers, indices associated with anesthesia and surgery, retinal nerve-fiber layer thickness, and frailty index to develop the clinical prediction model by using multiple logistic regression analysis and least absolute shrinkage and the selection operator (LASSO) method. The k-fold cross-validation method will be utilized to validate the clinical prediction model.

Here, we investigated the efficacy and safety of RT for general anesthesia in cirrhotic patients undergoing EVL. Methods: Patients undergoing EVL were randomly classified into the remimazolam tosilate (group R) and the propofol group (group P). RT was administered as a slow bolus of 0.2 mg/ kg for induction and followed by 1.0–2.0 mg/kg/h for maintenance of general anesthesia. Propofol was started at 2 mg/kg, followed by 4–10 mg/kg/h until the end of surgery. Flumazenil was routinely administered to group R and the same volume of saline was given to group P immediately after surgery. The efficacy and safety of RT for general anesthesia during EVL were compared with propofol. Results: All patients in the two groups had satisfactory anesthetic effects and the efficacy rates were 100%. The time to loss of consciousness (LoC) was longer in group R than in group P (P > 0.05). The return of consciousness (RoC) time, extubation time, and transfer time in group R were significantly shorter than that in group P (P < 0.05). The incidence of intraoperative hypotension and postoperative low SpO2 in group R were lower than that in the group P (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to the satisfaction degree of patients and operators (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Remimazolam tosilate can provide satisfactory anesthetic effects for surgery. Group R patients recovered faster and had a shorter PACU stay time than group P patients. Moreover, RT decreased the incidence of hypotension and low SpO2. RT was a safer and more effective alternative for general anesthesia in cirrhotic patients undergoing EVL than propofol. © 2022 Shi et al.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16462,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Few studies have investigated the impact of cardiac surgery on the trajectory of postoperative frailty. We hypothesized that cardiac surgery in frail patients would improve frailty postoperatively. METHOD: This study included 71 patients over 65 years old who were scheduled for cardiac surgery via sternotomy or thoracotomy. Frailty was prospectively evaluated using the Kihon Checklist (KCL) at 1 and 3 months postoperatively. Patients were divided into three groups based on the preoperative KCL score: nonfrail, prefrail, and frail. The interaction between the degree of preoperative frailty and the trajectory of postoperative KCL scores was assessed. RESULTS: The KCL score changed significantly over time (P < 0.001), and the KCL score trajectory differed significantly according to the degree of preoperative frailty (P for interaction = 0.003). In the frail group, the KCL score was significantly lower 3 months postoperatively than preoperatively (median 8, interquartile range [5, 9] versus median 9, interquartile range (9, 13), P = 0.029). CONCLUSION: The trajectory of postoperative KCL scores differed significantly depending on the degree of preoperative frailty. At 3 months after cardiac surgery, the KCL score of frail patients was significantly improved, while that in nonfrail patients was significantly deteriorated.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 6661,Search update 2023-11-13,,

The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of women ≥70 years who underwent hysterectomy. One hundred and twenty-one patients met the inclusion criteria. The median age among the cohort was 75 years (range: 70-91), and 52% underwent robotic surgery. The five-year overall survival (OS) rate was 67%. The five-year cumulative incidence of recurrence was 19%. Based on univariate analysis, white race, lower ASA score, higher pre-operative and post-operative haematocrit, lower estimated blood loss, stage I and robotic surgery were associated with improved OS. On multivariable analysis, ASA score, preoperative haematocrit, estimated blood loss and stage were associated with survival.Survival rates among older women were low and disease recurrence was high. Robotic surgery was safe and appeared to improve perioperative outcomes in older women with endometrial cancer.Impact StatementWhat is already known on this subject? Endometrial cancer is the most common gynaecologic cancer with an overall survival above 90%. Surgery is the cornerstone of treatment. With an ageing population, an increased incidence of endometrial cancer is also expected. Increased frailty and comorbid conditions may prevent this population from undergoing surgery; consequently, these patients are often undertreated for a potentially curable disease.What do the results of this study add? Older women with endometrial cancer have low survival rates and high disease recurrence rates. Elderly women can tolerate robotic surgery to reduce the risk of adverse events.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? It is important to develop best practices to optimise patients for minimally invasive surgery. The benefits of robotic surgery may encourage patients and surgeons to partake in this approach. A multidisciplinary approach with geriatric evaluation may improve post-operative care and survival.

BMC Geriatr.  2022. 22:585","Sieber, F., Gearhart, S., Bettick, D., Wang, N. Y.",Edmonton frailty scale score predicts postoperative delirium: a retrospective cohort analysis,"BACKGROUND: Frailty has been associated with postoperative delirium (POD). Studies suggest that the Fried phenotype has a stronger association with POD than the Edmonton Frailty Scale (EFS) criteria. Although phenotypic frailty is recognized as a good predictor of delirium, the EFS has higher ratings for feasibility in the surgical setting. Thus, our aim was to determine the association between EFS-assessed vulnerability and POD in an elective surgical population of older adults. A secondary aim was to determine which domains assessed by the EFS were closely associated with POD. METHODS: After IRB approval was received, electronic medical records of surgical patients at our institution were downloaded from 12/1/2018 to 3/1/2020. Inclusion criteria included age ≥ 65 years, preoperative EFS assessment within 6 months of surgery, elective surgery not scheduled for intensive care unit (ICU) stay but followed by at least 1 day postoperative stay, and at least two in-hospital evaluations with the 4 A's test (arousal, attention, abbreviated mental test-4, acute change [4AT]) on the surgical ward. Vulnerability was determined by EFS score ≥ 6. Patients were stratified into two groups according to highest postoperative 4AT score: 0-3 (no POD) and ≥ 4 (POD). Odds of POD associated with EFS score ≥ 6 were evaluated by using logistic regression adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: The dataset included 324 patients. Vulnerability was associated with higher incidence of POD (p = 0.0007, Fisher's exact). EFS ≥6 was consistently associated with POD in all bivariate models. Vulnerability predicted POD in multivariable modeling (OR = 3.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 11.5). Multivariable analysis of EFS domains revealed an overall trend in which higher scores per domain had a higher odds for POD. The strongest association occurred with presence of incontinence (OR = 3.8, 95% CI 1.2 to 11.0). CONCLUSIONS: EFS criteria for vulnerability predict POD in older, non-ICU patients undergoing elective surgery.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16751,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Dexmedetomidine, by its anti-inflammatory properties and other effects, can attenuate postoperative delirium. AIMS: The aim of this work was to study the incidence of delirium after coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and to compare the effects of dexmedetomidine and propofol on the incidence of postoperative delirium in coronary artery bypass graft surgery patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective, observational study was conducted on 180 consecutive patients undergoing off-pump or on-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The patients were administered either intravenous dexmedetomidine (n = 90) or propofol (n = 90) after hemostasis was achieved, till they were ready for weaning from the ventilator. The Confusion Assessment Method was used to assess the incidence of postoperative delirium. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 25 (13.8%) patients developed delirium after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Sedation with dexmedetomidine was associated with a significantly reduced incidence of postoperative delirium (8.9% v 18.9% propofol, P = 0.049). Subgroup analyses showed reduced incidence of postoperative delirium in off-pump patients compared to on-pump coronary artery bypass graft patients (3.3% vs. 20%, P = 0.009 dexmedetomidine group and 11.6% vs. 33.3%, P = 0.047 propofol group respectively).

Surgical series reporting treatment results often lack homogeneity, as these are collected over long time spans and their analysis is plagued by surgical learning curves and inconsistent use of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM). The authors report the oncological and functional long-term outcomes in a modern series of 100 consecutive ISCEs that were resected between 2000 and 2015 by a surgically experienced team that consistently utilized IONM. METHODS In this retrospective study, the authors tailored surgical strategy and multimodal IONM, including somatosensory evoked potentials, muscle motor evoked potentials (mMEPs), and D-waves, with the aim of gross-total resection (GTR). Preservation of the D-wave was the primary objective, and preservation of mMEPs was the second functional objective. Functional status was evaluated using the modified McCormick Scale (MMS) preoperatively, postoperatively, and at follow-up. RESULTS Preoperatively, 89 patients were functionally independent (MMS grade I or II). A GTR was achieved in 89 patients, 10 patients had a stable residual, and 1 patient underwent reoperation for tumor progression. At a mean follow-up of 65.4 months, 82 patients were functionally independent, and 11 lost their functional independence after surgery (MMS grades III–V). Muscle MEP loss predicted short-term postoperative worsening (p < 0.0001) only, while the strongest predictors of a good functional long-term outcome were lower preoperative MMS grades (p < 0.0001) and D-wave preservation. D-wave monitorability was 67%; it was higher with lower preoperative MMS grades and predicted a better recovery (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS In this large series of ISCEs, a high rate of GTR and long-term favorable functional outcome were achieved. Short- and long-term functional outcomes were best reflected by mMEPs and D-wave monitoring, respectively. © AANS 2022",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16463,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Quality of recovery is an important component of health care quality, but there is no published randomized control trial focused on the quality of recovery in patients undergoing total intravenous anesthesia with remimazolam. METHODS: This parallel-group, single-blind randomized control trial at a tertiary care medical center in South Korea was conducted to determine the difference in the quality of recovery between the patients administered remimazolam and those administered an inhalant anesthetic agent. A total of 168 patients aged 19-65 years who underwent elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy or robotic gynecologic surgery were considered for enrollment. Randomization was performed using sealed envelopes containing computer-generated random allocation sequences. Remimazolam was administered for the maintenance of anesthesia in the remimazolam group (Group R), and desflurane was administered in the desflurane group (Group D). The induction protocol and the target value of the bispectral index were identical in both groups. Patients were blinded to the drug that was administered until they finished the postoperative questionnaire. The main outcome measure was the decrement of the QoR-40 score on postoperative day 1 compared to the QoR-40 score on the day before surgery. RESULTS: A total of 165 patients were analyzed. The preoperative and postoperative global QoR-40 scores were 183 and 152 (IQR 173-192 and 136-169), respectively. The perioperative decrement of the global QoR-40 score was 29.96 ± 22.49. The decrement of the QoR-40 score was smaller in Group R than in Group D (26.99 versus 32.90, respectively; mean difference 5.91, 95% confidence interval -0.96-12.79). After adjustment for sex, the type of surgery and surgical time, the administration of remimazolam resulted in a 7.03-point (95% CI 0.35-13.72) less decrement of the QoR-40 score than desflurane. There were no severe adverse events in either group. CONCLUSION: Total intravenous anesthesia maintained with remimazolam provides a better quality of recovery than anesthesia maintained with an inhalant agent in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. Additionally, postoperative nausea and vomiting were largely reduced with remimazolam.

TRIAL DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Double-blind, parallel randomised control trial at a tertiary care medical centre in South Korea. Initially, 140 women aged 20-65 years who underwent general anaesthesia and had an American Society of Anesthesiology physical status classification of I or II were randomly assigned to the intervention group or the control group, and 134 patients (intervention n=65; control n=69) completed the study. INTERVENTION: Intramuscular administration of midazolam (0.05 mg/kg) or placebo (normal saline 0.01 mL/kg) on arrival at the preoperative holding area. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was the patient's overall satisfaction with the anaesthesia experience as determined by questionnaire responses on the day after surgery. Satisfaction was defined as a response of 3 or 4 on a five-point scale (0-4). The secondary outcomes included blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen desaturation, recovery duration and postoperative pain. RESULTS: Patients who received midazolam were more satisfied than those who received placebo (percentage difference: 21.0%, OR 3.56, 95% CI 1.46 to 8.70).

However, the effect of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) on this process is poorly understood. We aimed to evaluate preoperative and postoperative cognitive function changes in asymptomatic patients after CEA. METHODS: A systematic review of the existing reports in PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochran databases was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis statement recommendations. All original retrospective or prospective studies (including cohort, cross-sectional, case-control, pilot studies, etc) and clinical trials that compared pre and postoperative neurocognitive function in asymptomatic patients with carotid stenosis after CEA, which were published from January 2000 to April 2021 were identified and considered eligible for inclusion in the study. RESULTS: Thirteen studies (502 CEAs) comparing cognitive function changes before and after CEA were identified. In 7 studies with a total 272 patients, a mean age range of 67.3 ± 4.8 to 76.35 years old, and follow-up ranging between 1 and 12 months, overall cognitive function improved after CEA.

C., Bernersen, Ø, Ballangrud, R.",Effectiveness of the advisory display SmartPilot® view in the assessment of anesthetic depth in low risk gynecological surgery patients: a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Assessment of appropriate anesthetic depth is crucial to prevent harm to patients. Unnecessary deep anesthesia can be harmful, potentially causing acute renal failure, myocardial injury, delirium, and an increased mortality rate. Conversely, too light anesthesia combined with muscle relaxants can result in intraoperative patient awareness and lead to serious psychological trauma. This trial aimed to ascertain the effectiveness of the advisory display SmartPilot® View (SPV), as a supplemental measure in the assessment of anesthetic depth in low risk gynecological surgery patients. The hypothesis was that the use of the SPV would increase the precision of assessment, and result in a higher mean arterial pressure. METHODS: This trial used a randomized, controlled, single-blind design with a homogeneous sample. Patients undergoing minor, low risk gynecological surgery were randomly assigned to two groups: a test group wherein current standards were supplemented with the advisory display SPV and a control group assessed using only the current standards. Female patients aged between 18 and 75 years with American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System scores of 1-3 undergoing planned general anesthesia using the total intravenous anesthetic method, combining propofol and remifentanil, were included. The exclusion criteria included a body mass index ≥ 35 kg/m(2), a history of alcoholism, drug intake affecting propofol and remifentanil dynamics, and inability to consent. The independent sample t-test and chi-square test or Fisher's exact test were used to assess the statistical significance of differences between the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 114 patients were included in the analysis (test group n = 58, control group n = 56). No significant differences in the mean arterial pressure, heart rate, bispectral index, extubation delay, or post-anesthesia care unit stay were found between groups.

In this report, we describe experience in surgical management of patients with advanced diastolic heart failure symptoms after adequate transaortic septal myectomy for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Methods: We identified adult patients who presented with heart failure symptoms after previous transaortic septal myectomy for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and underwent repeat sternotomy for transapical myectomy to enlarge a small left ventricular cavity. Functional recovery after hospital dismissal was assessed through a questionnaire-based survey. Results: Six patients with previous septal myectomy presented with New York Heart Association functional class III symptoms. Preoperative transthoracic Doppler echocardiography confirmed adequate relief of subaortic outflow tract obstruction with only trivial or mild mitral valve regurgitation; left atrial volume index was increased at 46 mL/m2 (range, 44-47 mL/m2). Following transapical myectomy, the left ventricular diameter was enlarged from 23 mm (range, 21-27 mm) to 29 mm (range, 27-31 mm) at end-systole and from 40 mm (range, 38-42 mm) to 43 mm (range, 42-50 mm) at end-diastole. All the patients were alive after a median follow-up of 0.6 years (range, 0.4-3.5 years), and 5 patients responded to a postoperative survey and indicated improvement in their heart condition compared with functional status before the repeat myectomy. Conclusions: Patients with diastolic heart failure after septal myectomy for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may present with systolic cavity obliteration due to excessive myocardial hypertrophy. Repeat transapical myectomy can enlarge the left ventricular chamber and augment the diastolic volume, which results in improved physical capacity and patient-perceived functional status. © 2021 The Author(s)",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16471,Search update 2023-11-13,,

J., Partridge, J. S. L.",Evidence-based strategies to reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium: a narrative review,"Delirium is one of the most commonly occurring postoperative complications in older adults. It occurs due to the vulnerability of cerebral functioning to pathophysiological stressors. Identification of those at increased risk of developing delirium early in the surgical pathway provides an opportunity for modification of predisposing and precipitating risk factors and effective shared decision-making. No single delirium prediction tool is used widely in surgical settings. Multi-component interventions to prevent delirium involve structured risk factor modification supported by geriatrician input; these are clinically efficacious and cost effective. Barriers to the widespread implementation of such complex interventions exist, resulting in an ‘implementation gap’. There is a lack of evidence for pharmacological prophylaxis for the prevention of delirium. Current evidence suggests that avoidance of peri-operative benzodiazepines, careful titration of anaesthetic depth guided by processed electroencephalogram monitoring and treatment of pain are the most effective strategies to minimise the risk of delirium. Addressing postoperative delirium requires a collaborative, whole pathway approach, beginning with the early identification of those patients who are at risk. The research agenda should continue to examine the potential for pharmacological prophylaxis to prevent delirium while also addressing how successful models of delirium prevention can be translated from one setting to another, underpinned by implementation science methodology.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 7516,Search update 2023-11-13,,

The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of osteopenia as a risk factor for severe postoperative complications in elderly patients who underwent emergency gastrointestinal surgery. Methods: This study comprised 103 elderly patients who underwent emergency gastrointestinal surgery. Osteopenia was diagnosed by measuring bone mineral density, which was calculated as the average pixel density in the midvertebral core at the 11th thoracic vertebra on the preoperative plain computed tomography image. We retrospectively investigated the relationship between preoperative osteopenia and severe postoperative complications (Clavien–Dindo classification ≥III). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the risk factors for severe postoperative complications. Results: Twenty-three patients (22.3%) developed severe postoperative complications.

The univariate analysis revealed that the American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status of ≥3 (P =.0084), hemoglobin levels (P =.0026), albumin levels (P <.001), sarcopenia (P =.015), and osteopenia (P <.001) were significantly associated with severe postoperative complications. The multivariate analysis showed that osteopenia (P =.014) was an independent risk factor for severe postoperative complications. Conclusion: Osteopenia may be a risk factor for severe postoperative complications in elderly patients after emergency gastrointestinal surgery.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16472,Search update 2023-11-13,,

It has been validated mostly by retrospective studies, which often failed to follow the framework as recommended due to their retrospective nature. This study aims to validate GLIM with a large prospective study and investigate its role in predicting short-term surgical outcomes. Methods: Patients who underwent abdominal surgery for digestive cancer in our center were prospectively included between January 2020 and December 2020. Data collected included demographic information, clinical and pathological information, lab results, and computed tomography scans. Muscle strength, physical performances, quality of life and cancer symptom burden were evaluated upon admission. Multiple tools for nutritional risk screening were used. Nutritional status was evaluated with Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) and GLIM. Postoperative outcomes collected included return of gastrointestinal function, postoperative length of stay, complications, 30-day readmission and 30-day mortality. Results: A total of 1115 patients were evaluated with GLIM criteria. Inter-rater reliability was good [k = 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.72–0.80]. The accuracy of GLIM diagnosis compared to the semi-gold standard SGA varied with the screening method used. GLIM with MNA-SF screening [area under the curve (AUC): 0.78] and GLIM without screening (AUC: 0.77) were the two most accurate protocols, and there was no significant difference between the two from a clinical perspective. GLIM can predict preoperative nutritional status, functional status, symptom burden and quality of life. It can also predict complications after surgery [odds ratio (OR) = 2.31, 95% CI: 1.67–3.21], especially infection related complications (OR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.38–3.49) and wound healing related complications (OR = 2.54, 95% CI: 1.38–4.71). Conclusions: GLIM malnutrition criteria showed good inner-rater reliability and moderate agreement with SGA. GLIM can be used to predict preoperative nutritional status, functional status, cancer related symptoms, and quality of life. It can also predict postoperative outcomes especially complications that are related to infection and wound healing. In surgical candidates, the screening process could potentially be skipped so that GLIM assessment can be faster, more accessible, and more sensitive. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16473,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Herein, we aimed to evaluate safety including cognition recovery of RT administered in elderly patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and assess its safety dosage. METHODS: Ninety-nine patients presenting for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were randomized to receive 0.1 mg/kg RT (R1) or 0.2 mg/kg RT (R2), or propofol (P). Cognitive functions (memory, attention, and executive function) were measured via neuropsychological tests conducted before sedation and 5 min after recovery to full alertness. Adverse events were also assessed. RESULTS: There were no statistical differences between postoperative and baseline results for R1 group and P group, whereas those for R2 group revealed worsened postoperative cognitive functions (immediate recall and short delay recall) than baseline (P < 0.05). Compared with P group, Scores demonstrated worse restoration of immediate recall in R1 group, immediate recall, short-delayed recall, and attention function in R2 group (P < 0.05). Patients in R2 group had a longer sedation time (12.09 vs 8.27 vs 8.21 min; P < 0.001) and recovery time (6.85 vs 3.82 vs 4.33 min; P < 0.001) than that in R1 group and P group. Moreover, the incidence of hypotension was 3.0% in R1 group, whereas it was 21.2% in R2 group and 48.5% in P group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The addition of 0.1 mg/kg RT as an adjunct to opiate sedation for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy not only achieves more stable perioperative hemodynamics but also achieves acceptable neuropsychiatric functions in elderly patients.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 9157,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Therefore, it is very important to search for preventive drugs. Previous studies have demonstrated that perioperative use of dexmedetomidine resulted in a decrease the incidence of POD and POCD. But the specific effect of dexmedetomidine on elderly patients undergoing hepatic lobectomy and its potential mechanism are not clear. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of intraoperative use of dexmedetomidine on preventing POD and POCD in elderly patients undergoing hepatic lobectomy and the influence on the balance between proinflammation and anti-inflammation. METHODS: This trial was designed as a single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled study. One hundred and twenty hospitalized patients from January 2019 to December 2020, aged 60-80 years old with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) II-III and scheduled for hepatic lobectomy, were randomly allocated into 3 groups (n=40) using a random number table: A C group, a Dex1 group, and a Dex2 group. After anesthesia induction, saline in the C group, dexmedetomidine [0.3 μg/(kg·h)] in the Dex1 group, and dexmedetomidine [0.6 μg/(kg·h)] in the Dex2 group were infused until the end of operation. The incidences of hypotension and bradycardia were compared among the 3 groups. Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) for assessing POD and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) for evaluating POCD were recorded and venous blood samples were obtained for the determination of neuron specific enolase (NSE), TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-10 at the different time below: the time before anesthesia (T0), and the first day (T1), the third day (T2), the fifth day (T3), and the seventh day (T4) after operation. RESULTS: Compared with the C group, the incidences of bradycardia in the Dex1 group or the Dex2 group increased (both P<0.05) and there was no difference in hypotension in the Dex1 group or the Dex2 group (both P>0.05). The incidences of POD in the C group, the Dex1 group, and the Dex2 group were 22.5%, 5.0%, and 7.5%, respectively. The incidences of POD in the Dex1 group or the Dex2 group declined significantly as compared to the C group (both P<0.05). However, there is no difference in the incidence of POD between the Dex1 group and the Dex2 group (P>0.05). The incidences of POCD in the C group, the Dex1 group, and the Dex2 group were 30.0%, 12.5%, and 10.0%, respectively. The incidences of POCD in the Dex1 group and the Dex2 group declined significantly as compared to the C group (both P<0.05). And no obvious difference was seen in the incidence of POCD in the Dex1 group and the Dex2 group (P>0.05). Compared with the C group, the level of TNF-α and IL-1β decreased and the level of IL-10 increased at each time points (from T1 to T4) in the Dex1 group and the Dex2 group (all P<0.05). Compared with the Dex1 group, the level of IL-1β at T2 and IL-10 from T1 to T3 elevated in the Dex2 group (all P<0.05). Compared with the T0, the concentrations of NSE in C group at each time points (from T1 to T4) and in the Dex1 group and the Dex2 group from T1 to T3 increased (all P<0.05). Compared with the C group, the level of NSE decreased from T1 to T4 in the Dex1 group and the Dex2 group (all P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative dexmedetomidine infusion can reduce the incidence of POCD and POD in elderly patients undergoing hepatic lobectomy, and the protective mechanism appears to involve the down-regulation of TNF-α and IL-1β and upregulation of IL-10 expression, which lead to rebalance between proinflammation and anti-inflammation.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 6801,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Prior studies have shown mixed results. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of preoperative embolization in patients undergoing spine surgery for metastatic RCC with consideration of multiple confounders. We aim to assess blood loss and other outcomes reflective of functional status and postoperative complications. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted for 43 patients that underwent surgery for metastatic spinal RCC and either received preoperative embolization (n = 29) or did not (n = 14). Mann Whitney tests were run for initial analyses. Multivariate regression models were then used to predict outcomes while controlling for multiple demographic and preoperative variables. Results: Mann Whitney tests revealed a significant difference between the mean age of patients undergoing preoperative embolization in comparison to those that did not (59.2 years versus 52.4 years; p = 0.044). We found that preoperative embolization was not significantly associated with decreased blood loss (2257 mL versus 2000 mL; p = 0.97). There were also no significant differences between groups in post-procedural complications (34.5% versus 14.3%; p = 0.097), last follow-up Nurick score (β = 0.72, p = 0.18; 2.1 versus 1.6) or operative duration (β = 28, p = 0.66; 408 min versus 353 min). The female gender was found to be significantly associated with higher last follow-up Nurick scores (β = 1.24, p = 0.033).

METHODS: Patients undergoing BTR were queried from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSIQP) for the years 2015 to 2019. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to evaluate the independent associations between frailty tools (age, 5-factor modified frailty score [mFI-5], and RAI-A) on postoperative complications and discharge outcomes. RESULTS: We identified 30,951 patients who underwent craniotomy for BTR; the median age of our study sample was 59 (IQR 47-68) years old and 47.8% of patients were male. Overall, increasing RAI-A score, in an overall stepwise fashion, was associated with increasing risk of adverse outcomes including in-hospital mortality, non-routine discharge, major complications, Clavien-Dindo Grade IV complication, and extended length of stay. Multivariable regression analysis (adjusting for age, sex, BMI, non-elective surgery status, race, and ethnicity) demonstrated that RAI-A was an independent predictor for worse BTR outcomes. The RAI-A tiers 41-45 (1.2% cohort) and > 45 (0.3% cohort) were ~ 4 (Odds Ratio [OR]: 4.3, 95% CI: 2.1-8.9) and ~ 9 (OR: 9.5, 95% CI: 3.9-22.9) times more likely to have in-hospital mortality compared to RAI-A 0-20 (34% cohort). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Increasing preoperative frailty as measured by the RAI-A score is independently associated with increased risk of complications and adverse discharge outcomes after BTR. The RAI-A may help providers present better preoperative risk assessment for patients and families weighing the risks and benefits of potential BTR.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16849,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Minimized opioid use due to surgery has been shown to have a better effect on patient recovery after surgery. In this study we evaluate the effect of opioid free anesthesia for postoperative nausea and vomiting in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Materials and methods: 80 patients aged 20-65 years old were included in this randomized, clinical and prospective trial. The patients belonged to the ASA classifications 1 and 2 and were scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Patients were classified into two groups: group 1 (fentanyl group- FG), which included 40 patients who received opioid anesthesia, and group 2 (opioid free anesthesia group-OFAG) which included 40 patients who received opioid free anesthesia. In patients from group 1 (fentanyl group -FG) introduction to general anesthesia consisted of giving midazolam at 0.04 mg/kg, fentanyl at 0.002 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg of propofol and 0.6 mg/kg of rocuronium bromide. These patients received fractionated bolus doses of fentanyl during surgery. Prior to general anesthesia these patients did not receive dexamethasone. The patients from group 2 (opioid free anesthesia group - OFAG) received dexamethasone at 0.1 mg/kg and 1 g of paracetamol before introduction to anesthesia as a pre-emptive analgesia. Introduction to anesthesia consisted of giving midazolam at 0.04 mg/kg, lidocaine at 1 mg/kg, propofol at 2 mg/kg, ketamine at 0.5 mg/kg, and 0.6 mg/kg of rocuronium bromide. Immediately after intubation, continuous intravenous infusion with lidocaine at 2 mg/kg/h and magnesium sulfate at 1.5 g/h was given. In this group, fentanyl was not given either during the introduction of anesthesia or during the intraoperative period. Immediately after extraction of the gallbladder patients from group 2 (OFAG) received 2.5 g of metamizole intravenously. PONV were recorded in the postoperative period of 24 hours after surgery. Results: There was no significant difference with respect to age, weight, sex, duration of surgery, and anesthesia time. PONV at different time intervals were statistically not significant at all postoperative time points - 1 hr, 4 hr, 8 hr, 12 hr and 24 hr after surgery in fentanyl group compared to opioid free anesthesia group. Even not statistically significant, PONV have occurred more often in patients who received opioid anesthesia. Conclusion: Postoperative nausea and vomiting occurs more often in patients who received opioids during laparoscopic cholecystectomy compared to patients who received opioid free anesthesia, but without statistical significance.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16766,Search update 2023-11-13,,

T.",Is Multimodal Anesthesia Effecting Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting in Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy?,"Background: Multimodal anesthesia represents a technique that can improve analgesia and lower the occurrence of opioid side effects in the postoperative period, such as postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). It can be achieved by providing different types of medication during the intraoperative period which can decrease the need for opioids. PONV happens more often in patients who have received large amounts of opioids during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In this study, our aim was to observe the occurrence of PONV between three different groups of patients who received lidocaine, ketamine and magnesium sulfate in combination with fentanyl in the intraoperative period. We also observed any additional nausea and vomiting in the three groups as well as the amount of fentanyl given to these groups during operation. Materials and methods: 120 patients aged 20-65 years old were included in this randomized and prospective study, ASA classification 1 and 2, scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Patients were classified into three groups randomly: Group 1 (lidocaine group-LG), these patients received lidocaine at 1 mg/kg during induction to general anesthesia and 2 mg/kg/h after intubation in continuous intravenous infusion; Group 2 (ketamine group-KG) these patients received ketamine at 0.5 mg/kg during induction to general anesthesia; and Group 3 (magnesium group-MG) these patients received magnesium sulfate at 1.5 gr/hr as a continuous intravenous infusion after intubation. In all three groups, patients additionally received bolus doses of fentanyl. Postoperative nausea and vomiting were monitored in all three groups at 1, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after surgery as a primary objective, and if patients had complainant of vomiting, they were treated with 10 mg of metoclopramid. Between the five control time points, additional nausea and vomiting was recorded as well, as a secondary objective. The third objective was to measure of the total amount of fentanyl given in the intraoperative period. Results: Patients from the lidocaine group experienced less PONV and they received less fentanyl compared to patients of ketamine and magnesium groups. Patients from the ketamine group had more nausea than other groups. In the magnesium group, the rate of vomiting was higher, and they received higher amounts of fentanyl during surgery. Additional nausea and vomiting occurred in 3 patients in the LG, 2 in the KG, and 3 in the MG between the five control time points. The patients from the magnesium group received the highest dose of fentanyl during surgery (307.50 ± 130.4), followed by the patients from the ketamine group (292.50 ± 60.5), and then patients from the lidocaine group (258.75 ± 60.9). The doses of fentanyl that patients received during surgery in all three groups were not statistically significant. Conclusion: Multimodal anesthesia has been shown to lower PONV 24 hours after laparoscopic cholecystectomy and can lower need for opioids during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16767,Search update 2023-11-13,,

DESIGN AND SETTINGS: The authors' research was a single-center, prospective, observational study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03736499). PARTICIPANTS & INTERVENTIONS: The authors examined 252 patients who underwent elective cardiac surgery. Preoperative thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (fT3), free thyroxine (fT4), prolactin, and testosterone levels were collected and analyzed after the surgery. The Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI), Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT), and Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI) were all calculated as a sum and groups. Frailty was calculated based on the modified Frailty Index-11. The primary outcome was overall mortality. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 64.23 years (standard deviation: 11.07 years). Thirty-three patients (13.01%) died during the median follow-up time of 20.48 months (interquartile range: 18.90-22.98 months). Thyroid hormones were examined as continuous variables and also in 3 groups based on low, normal, and high hormone levels. Continuous TSH (p = 0.230), continuous fT3 (p = 0.492), and continuous fT4 (p = 0.657) were not significantly associated with total mortality. After adjustment for the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II and postoperative complications, the following nutritional scores were associated with total mortality: GNRI < 91 (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR]: 4.384; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.866-10.303, p = 0.001), the higher CONUT group (AHR: 1.736; 95% CI: 1.736-2.866, p = 0.031), and a PNI < 48 points (AHR: 3.465; 95% CI: 1.735-6.918, p < 0.001). The modified Frailty Index-11 was not associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Before cardiac surgery, nutritional status should be assessed because the findings may help to decrease mortality.

We conducted a multi-center prospective study to evaluate the role of the G8 as a screening tool in the assessment of intra and post-operative complications of elderly patients (≥70 y.o.) undergoing surgery for kidney cancer. A total of 162 patients were prospectively enrolled between January 2015 to January 2019 and divided into two study groups (frail vs. not-frail) according to their geriatric risk profile based on G8 score. Several factors (i.e., age, CCI, ASA score, preoperative anemia, RENAL score, surgical procedures, and techniques) were analyzed to identify whether any of them would configure as a statistically significant predictor of surgical complications. According to the G8 Score, 90 patients were included in the frail group. A total of 52 frail patients vs. 4 non-frail patients developed a postoperative complication of any kind (p < 0.001).

F.",Using the risk analysis index to assess frailty in a veteran cohort undergoing endovascular aortic aneurysm repair,"OBJECTIVE: Surgical frailty is strongly associated with increased perioperative morbidity and mortality. The risk analysis index (RAI) is a validated frailty score system, which has been shown to predict for short-term outcomes and long-term mortality in various surgical subspecialties. In the present study, we applied the frailty score to a veteran aneurysm population who had undergone nonemergent endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR). METHODS: After obtaining institutional review board approval, the Veteran Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Program data were queried for endovascular repair of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm or dissection using the Current Procedural Terminology codes 34,800, 34,803, and 34,805 from 2001 to 2018. The preoperative variables were used to calculate the RAI score. The patients were placed into six cohorts according to the RAI score (≤20, 21-25, 26-30, 31-35, 35-40, and ≥41). The χ(2) test and analysis of variance test were used compare the cohorts. Forward logistic regression modeling was used to determine the risks of each cohort. RESULTS: From 2001 to 2018, 5568 patients had undergone EVAR. Of the 5568 patients, 99.6% were male, with a mean age of 71 ± 8 years. Of these patients, 4.5%, 43.8%, 33.9%, 11.7%, 4.2%, and 1.8% were included in the following RAI groups: ≤20, 21 to 25, 26 to 30, 31 to 35, 35 to 40, and ≥41, respectively. Frailty was associated with increased rates of overall complications, death, and an increased length of stay. When risk adjusted, frailty at the highest vs lowest level was associated with 2.7 times the odds of any complication developing and 4.4 times the odds of mortality ≤30 days. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty, as determined by the RAI, was associated with postoperative outcomes in a dose-dependent manner. Frailty was associated with higher rates of major cardiac (myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest), pulmonary (pneumonia, failure to wean from ventilation, reintubation), renal (renal failure), overall complications, length of stay, and death.

This research is designed to probe into the influence of Narcotrend- (NT-) assisted anesthesia in-depth monitor on cognitive impairment of elderly patients under general anesthesia (GA). Methods. One hundred and forty-four elderly patients with GA in our hospital from October 2020 to April 2021 were randomized into two groups, namely, NT group (supervised anesthesia under NT monitoring) and group C (anesthesia according to doctors' experience). The heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and central venous pressure (CVP) were recorded before surgery (T0), at the beginning of surgery (T1), at the end of surgery (T2), and 1 day after surgery (T3). Serum of patients was obtained at these four time points for measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and cortisol (Cor) levels using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The alterations in cognitive function pre- and post-anesthesia were assessed using the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), and adverse events (AEs) during anesthesia recovery, postoperative recovery, and dosage of anesthetics were recorded. Results. At T1 and T2, MAP was higher and CVP was lower in NT group, versus group C. NT group presented higher CRP, IL-6, and Cor than group C at T1-T3. MMSE scores were higher in TN group than in group C at 12, 24, and 48 h after surgery. The incidence rates of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) and total AEs in group C were noticeably higher than those in NT group. Compared with group C, the time of anesthesia recovery, extubation, and postanesthesia care unit (PACU) residence in NT group reduced remarkably. Conclusions. NT has little effect on the physical condition of elderly patients under GA, and can reduce the dosage of narcotic drugs and promote the recovery of patients from anesthesia, which has high clinical value.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16806,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Acta Medica Mediterranea.  2022. 38:921-926","Türkmen, S., Mutlu, M.",EFFECT OF POSTOPERATIVE PAIN AFTER INGUINAL HERNIORRHAPHY ON POSTOPERATIVE COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION,"Introduction: Inguinal herniorrhaphy is one of the most common operations in general surgery, frequently performed under general anesthesia due to a lack of experience with regional anesthesia. General anesthetic affects central nervous system functions to varying degrees and durations, apart from the acute loss of consciousness. This psychomotor function disorder observed after operations are defined as postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). The mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) are the methods most frequently used for POCD assessment. Objective: This study evaluates the correlation between early-period cognitive functions and postoperative pain scores in patients operated for inguinal hernia. Methodology: The study included 100 patients aged 18-70 years, with ASA I-III, undergoing unilateral inguinal herniorrhaphy. Fifty sequential patients with TAP block performed were included in the TABP group (TG), while 50 patients choosing multimodal analgesia were included in the control group (CG). The patients' pain scores were evaluated with VAS, and for POCD evaluation, MMSE was performed before the operation to assess postoperative cognitive dysfunction during the study. The correlation between postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) scores and MMSE was evaluated in both groups. Results: VAS scores at the 15th min, 30th min, 2nd h, 12th h, and 24th h were lower in TG than the CG cases with statistical significance (Table 3, p=0.001; p<0.01). Although the 6th h VAS score of TG cases was lower than those in CG, it was not statistically significant (Table 3, Figure 1, p>0.05). There were no statistically significant differences observed between MMSE scores between the patients in both groups (p>0.05, Table 4). But there were statistically significant differences between the preoperative and postoperative MMSE scores in both groups (p=0.001; p<0.01). Conclusions: POCD and MMSE scores were associated more with the anesthesia method selected in our study of general anesthesia. There was no significant correlation between the postoperative VAS scores and the POCD.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16478,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Although curative surgery is the treatment of choice for resectable colorectal cancer (CRC), it is still debated whether elderly frail patients should undergo major cancer surgery due to the increased risk of postoperative and long-term mortality. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the impact of age and comorbidities on postoperative mortality/morbidity and long-term outcomes, looking for potential age-related survival differences. Methods: A total of 1,482 patients operated for CRC at our institution between January 2005 and October 2020 were analysed. The independent effect of age and comorbidities on postoperative complications was assessed by a logistic model, while the effect on overall survival (OS) and cancer-related survival (CRS) was estimated by a Cox regression model. Results: The median age in the cohort was 67.8 years. Postoperative mortality was very low in the whole cohort (0.8%) and contained even in older age groups (3.2% in patients aged 80–84 years, 4% in the 85–90-year age group). The cumulative incidence of postoperative complications was doubled in patients with comorbidities (32.8% vs. 15.1%, p = 0.002). With regard to OS, as expected, it exponentially decreased with advancing age. Conversely, differences in CRS were less pronounced between age groups and absent in patients with stage 0–I CRC. Analysis of all causes and cancer-related mortality revealed a peak within 2 years from surgery, suggesting a prolonged impact of surgery. In patients aged 75 years and above, all-cause mortality showed a steep increase 1 year after surgery, while cancer-related mortality plateaued at about 4 years after surgery. On multivariable analysis, OS, but not CRS, was significantly influenced by age. Conclusions: Although acceptable results of surgery in elderly patients, OS is strongly dependent on age: older people die more from competing causes than cancer-related treatments compared to younger age classes. The preoperative identification of risk factors for low OS may help the selection of those elderly patients who would benefit from curative CRC surgery.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16808,Search update 2023-11-13,,

BACKGROUND: The development of delirium following hip fracture is common among older patients. According to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 30% of delirium cases are preventable. The prevention of delirium, a multifactorial syndrome, can be achieved through a multicomponent care protocol that targets specific risk factors for delirium. DESIGN: A randomised controlled study was conducted according to the CONSORT 2010 guidelines. The Clinical Trial Registry number is NCT04188795. METHODS: A total of 84 patients were assigned to two groups by block randomisation. The intervention group (n = 41) received nursing care according to a protocol and the control group (n = 43) received standard nursing care. Study data were collected using the demographic information form, the Confusion Assessment Method-Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU), the Barthel Index, the Mini Nutritional Assessment-short form and the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ). The pain of the patients was assessed by using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 80.6 years (standard deviation 8.0; range 65.0- 97.5 years), and the percentage of the male patients were 36.3%. No statistically significant differences were found between the groups in terms of pain and functional status in the preoperative period, on the first postoperative day, or in the predischarge period (p > 0.05 for each). The sleep quality of patients in the intervention group was significantly better than in the control group for all three time measurements (p < 0.05 for each). While 15% of patients in the control group developed delirium, no patient in the intervention group developed delirium (x(2) =6.486, p = 0.026). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that a delirium prevention care protocol may reduce the incidence of delirium and improve sleep quality.

We present a review focused on preventing pulmonary complications in the interventional NORA setting. RECENT FINDINGS: NORA locations should function as independent, autonomous ambulatory units. We discuss a strategic plan involving a thorough preoperative evaluation of patients, including recognizing high-risk patients and their anesthetic management. Finally, we offer guidance on the challenges of conducting sedation and anesthesia in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or a history of COVID-19. SUMMARY: The demands on the interventional NORA anesthesia team are increasing. Strategic planning, checklists, consistent staffing assignments, and scheduled safety drills are valuable tools to improve patient safety.

Surgery is the main treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC) but has been associated with a loss of HRQL in older patients. This study aimed to identify determinants for a decreased HRQL at three months after CRC diagnosis. METHOD: This multi-centre observational cohort study (NCT04443816) included 273 patients aged ≥70 years diagnosed with non-metastatic CRC. A multi-domain frailty screening was performed in each patient. A decreased HRQL was defined as a mean difference ≥ 10 on the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire between baseline and three months after CRC diagnosis. Determinants of a decreased HRQL were analysed using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: A decrease in HRQL occurred in 63 patients (23.1%). Non-surgical patients had the highest risk of decreased HRQL three months after diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 6.4 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.0-19.8)). The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) (aOR 2.3 (95% (CI) 1.2-4.2)), the American Association of Anesthesiologists class (aOR 2.6 (95%CI 1.4-4.9)), impaired daily functioning (aOR 2.7 (95%CI 1.3-5.6)) and dependent living (aOR 1.9 (95%CI 1.1-4.5)) were associated with a decreased HRQL, mainly caused by non-surgical patients. In surgical patients, a major postoperative complication was a strong determinant of decreased HRQL and was associated with preoperative comorbidity and cognitive impairment (aOR 4.0 (95%CI 1.9-8.8)). CONCLUSION: Frailty characteristics are highly prevalent in older patients at time of CRC diagnosis but not strongly associated with a decreased HRQL after three months. Non-surgical patients and patients with major postoperative complications had the highest risk of decreased HRQL.

P.",Cognition and Cognitive Reserve in Cochlear Implant Recipients,"At present, dementia is a hot topic. Hearing loss is considered to be a modifiable risk factor for cognitive decline. The underlying mechanism remains unclear and might be mediated by socioeconomic and psychosocial factors. Cochlear implantation has been shown not only to restore auditory abilities, but also to decrease mental distress and to improve cognitive functions in people with severe hearing impairment. However, the promising results need to be confirmed. In a prospective single-center study, we tested the neurocognitive abilities of a large group of 71 subjects with bilateral severe hearing impairment with a mean age of 66.03 (SD = 9.15) preoperatively and 6, 12, and 24 months after cochlear implantation using a comprehensive non-auditory computer-based test battery, and we also assessed the cognitive reserve (CR) [Cognitive Reserve Index (CRI)], health-related quality of life (QoL) (Nijmegen Cochlear Implant Questionnaire), and depression (Geriatric Depression Scale-15). Cognitive functions significantly increased after 6 months in attention (p = 0.00004), working memory (operation span task; p = 0.002), and inhibition (p = 0.0002); and after 12 months in recall (p = 0.003) and verbal fluency (p = 0.0048), and remained stable up to 24 months (p ≥ 0.06). The CR positively correlated with cognitive functions pre- and post-operatively (both p < 0.005), but postoperative improvement in cognition was better in subjects with poor CR (p = 0.003). Depression had only a slight influence on one subtest. No correlation was found among cognitive skills, quality of life, and speech perception (each p ≥ 0.05). Cochlear implantation creates an enriched environment stimulating the plasticity of the brain with a global positive impact on neurocognitive functions, especially in subjects with poor preoperative cognitive performance and low cognitive reserve.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16803,Search update 2023-11-13,,

We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the effect of perioperative MMA on the prevention for POD. This meta-analysis is registered in the PROSPERO (CRD42020164900). We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library through August 1, 2020 to identify randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed MMA for the prevention for POD in adult patients undergoing surgery. The primary outcome was POD. Relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was pooled using a random-effects model. Nine RCTs with 1452 patients were included. The incidence of POD was 23.8% (173/726) and 24.4% (177/726) in the MMA and placebo groups, respectively.

Methods: The participants were selected from the Perioperative Neurocognitive Disorder Risk Factor and Prognosis (PNDRFAP) study and the Perioperative Neurocognitive Disorder and Biomarker Lifestyle (PNDABLE) study. The logistic regression equation was used to analyze the risk factors and protective factors of POD. The interaction term (SUA × Sex) was introduced into the linear model to explore the potential modification effects of sex on the identified correlations. We analyzed the mediating effects of Alzheimer-related biomarkers. Finally, we constructed the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the nomogram model to evaluate the efficacy of SUA and Alzheimer-related biomarkers in predicting POD. Results: Patients with POD had elevated SUA level (PNDRFAP: p = 0.002, PNDABLE: p < 0.001). Preoperative SUA level was positively correlated with CSF phosphorylated tau (P-tau) (p = 0.027) and β-amyloid42 (Aβ42)/P-tau (p = 0.023). Interaction analysis did not find any modification effect of sex. The relationship between SUA and POD was partially mediated by CSF P-tau (15.3%). ROC curve showed that the model combining SUA and Alzheimer-related biomarkers had better performance in predicting POD [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.880; p < 0.001], and the predictive model is accurate. Conclusions: High SUA may enhance CSF P-tau level, thus increasing the risk of POD, and the model combining SUA and Alzheimer-related biomarkers can accurately predict the occurrence of POD.

The objective was to determine whether administering remifentanil-propofol combined with dexmedetomidine during general anesthesia would decrease the incidence and severity of postoperative emergence agitation, anxiety, and depression without affecting cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients. METHODS: A total of 120 elderly patients scheduled for ureteroscopic holmium laser lithotripsy were randomly allocated to the PR group and administered normal saline, and the PRD group was administered dexmedetomidine 0.4 μg kg(-1) h(-1) intravenously after the induction of anesthesia and stopped 30 min before the end of surgery. The primary outcome was the Mini-Mental State Examination score. The secondary outcomes were the Richmond Agitation Sedation, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale scores; the memory span for Arabic numerals; the duration of surgery; and the time to spontaneous respiration, recovery, and extubation. RESULTS: The MMSE scores were lower at T(1-2) in the two groups (P < 0.001). The dosage of propofol and remifentanil decreased more significantly in the PRD group than in the PR group (P < 0.001). Both the RASS scores and the incidence of emergence agitation (EA) in the PRD group were significantly lower than those in the PR group at t(1-3) (P < 0.001). Compared to the PR group, the ZSDS scores and STAI scores at T(1-2) were lower in the PRD group (P < 0.005). The number of the Arabic numbers that were accurately recalled from memory was lower at T(2) in the PR group than in the PRD group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine administration has no influence on postoperative cognitive dysfunction but could reduce both the dosage of remifentanil and propofol needed during ureteroscopic holmium laser lithotripsy and the incidence and severity of postoperative emergence agitation, anxiety, and depression in elderly patients.

Elderly patients with compromised cardiovascular compensatory reserve are more susceptible to hypotension after induction of general anesthesia. This study investigated whether the carotid artery corrected flow time (FTc) and respiratory variation of peak blood flow velocity in the common carotid artery (ΔVpeak) could predict postinduction hypotension in elderly patients. METHODS: This prospective observational study included elderly patients aged 65 to 75 who were scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia with ASA physical status class of I-II, without cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, or obesity. Anesthesia was induced by midazolam, sufentanil, and etomidate and was maintained by sevoflurane. The carotid artery FTc and ΔVpeak were measured by ultrasound before induction of anesthesia. Hemodynamic data were recorded before induction and then during the first 10 min after induction. RESULTS: Ninety-nine patients were included in the final analysis, of whom 63 developed postinduction hypotension. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves was 0.87 (0.78 to 0.93) for carotid artery FTc and 0.67 (0.56 to 0.76) for ΔVpeak, respectively. The optimal cutoff value for predicting postinduction hypotension was 379.1 ms for carotid artery FTc, with sensitivity and specificity of 72.2 and 93.7%, respectively. The best cutoff value was 7.5% for ΔVpeak, with sensitivity and specificity of 55.6 and 75.0%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The carotid artery FTc is a reliable predictor of postinduction hypotension in elderly patients with ASA status of I or II, without cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, or obesity. Elderly patients with a carotid artery FTc less than 379.1 ms before anesthesia have a higher risk of postinduction hypotension.

Design: Sub-analysis of the DECADE multi-center randomized trial. Setting: Patients who had cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass at the Cleveland Clinic. Interventions: In the underlying trial, patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to dexmedetomidine or normal saline placebo. Measurements: Intraoperative mean arterial pressures were recorded at 1-min intervals from arterial catheters or at 1–5-min intervals oscillometrically. Postoperative blood pressures were recorded every half-hour or more often. The co-primary outcomes were atrial fibrillation and delirium occurring between intensive care unit admission and the earlier of postoperative day 5 or hospital discharge. Delirium was assessed twice daily during the initial 5 postoperative days while patients remained hospitalized with the Confusion Assessment Method for the intensive care unit. Assessments were made by trained research fellows who were blinded to the dexmedetomidine administration. Main results: There was no significant association between intraoperative hypotension and delirium, with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.81, 1.09; P = 0.419) for a doubling in AUC of mean arterial pressure (MAP) <60 mmHg. An increase in intraoperative AUC of MAP <60 mmHg was not significantly associated with the odds of atrial fibrillation (adjusted odds ratio = 0.99; 95% CI: 0.87, 1.11; P = 0.819).

Secondary outcomes include the day of postoperative delirium onset, duration (time from first to last delirium-positive day), and total delirium-positive days among patients who developed delirium; tracheal intubation time in PACU; the length of stay in PACU; the rate of postoperative shivering; the rate of postoperative nausea and vomiting; the rate of emergence agitation; pain severity; QoR40 at the first day after surgery; the length of stay in hospital after surgery; and the incidence of non-delirium complications within 30 days after surgery. DISCUSSION: The primary objective of this study is to compare the impact of propofol and sevoflurane on the incidence of postoperative delirium for elderly patients undergoing spine surgery. The results may help inform strategies to the optimal selection of maintenance drugs for general anesthesia in elderly patients undergoing spine surgery.

The degree of cognitive impairment was divided into POCD positive group (n=141, 20.52%) and POCD negative group (n=546, 79.48%). The general data of the two groups were compared. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the risk factors for POCD in elderly gastric cancer patients after radical surgery. A risk prediction model was established. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the ffectiveness of the model. Results: Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that preoperative ASA classification (OR=4.674, 95% CI: 1.610-12.651, P=0.020, age (OR=3.130, 95% CI: 1.307-8.669, P=0.001), operation time (OR=2.724, 95% CI: 1.232-7.234, P=0.031), preoperative PG-SGA score (OR=4.023, 95% CI: 1.011-10.883, P=0.048), and preoperative hemoglobin (OR=4.158, 95% CI: 2.255-8.227, P=0.001) were independent risk factors for POCD.

Platelet count has been proved to be an essential factor in inflammation. However, as far as we know, the relationship between platelet count and PND is not clear yet in the orthopedic area. PND could be a long-term disease, which sometimes lasts for several years, and it is meaningful to find a biomarker of PND at the early stage. Thus, we designed this study to find out the association between perioperative platelet count and occurrence of PND, and determine whether preoperative platelet count could be a biomarker of the early stage of PND. METHODS: A prospective observational study was performed on the patients who would take total knee arthroplasty or total hip arthroplasty. Their peripheral platelets were counted by blood routine examination 1 day before and 3 days after the surgery. And we assessed their neurocognitive functions 1 day before and 3 days after the surgery. These data were recorded and analyzed to find out the relationship between platelet count and the occurrence of PND. RESULTS: Eventually, 70 patients finished the whole process, and 14 of them developed PND. The median preoperative platelet count in the PND group was significantly higher than that in the non-PND group (239 vs 168 × 10^9/L, p = 0.009). Preoperative platelet count was an independent risk factor for PND (odds ratio = 1.014, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.000-1.027, P = 0.043) in the logistic multivariable regression, while the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve of the prediction model was 0.796 (95% CI 0.676-0.916). CONCLUSIONS: The higher preoperative and postoperative level of platelet count in the peripheral blood were associated with the early stage of PND, and preoperative platelet count could be a potential predictor of the early stage of PND in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgeries.

This study investigated the association between RAI-rev and postoperative MMM in older patients undergoing abdominal surgery. It also assessed the predictive value of RAI-rev combined with other preoperative risk factors. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study reviewed the medical records of all patients aged 65 and older who underwent abdominal surgery between January 2018 and December 2019. The primary outcome was the postoperative MMM during hospitalization, and its association with preoperative RAI-rev scores was assessed using multivariable logistic regression analysis. The prediction of postoperative outcomes was used the receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS: A total of 2225 older patients were analyzed, and 258 (11.6%) developed postoperative MMM. After adjusting for confounders, each unit increase in RAI-rev scores resulted in a 2.3% increase in the MMM risk and a 3.0% increase in the odds of life-threatening complications and mortality (both P < 0.05).

S-ketamine has neuroprotective properties as a dissociative anaesthetic. Emerging literature has indicated that S-ketamine can reduce cognitive impairment in patients with depression. However, the role of S-ketamine in preventing POD remains unknown. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effect of intraoperative prophylactic S-ketamine compared with that of dexmedetomidine on the incidence of POD in elderly patients undergoing non-cardiac thoracic surgery. Methods and analysis This will be a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, positive-controlled, non-inferiority trial that enrolled patients aged 60-90 years undergoing thoracic surgery. The patients will be randomly allocated in a ratio of 1:1:1 to S-ketamine, dexmedetomidine or normal saline placebo groups using computer-generated randomisation with a block size of six. The primary outcome will be the incidence of POD within 4 days after surgery and this will be assessed using a 3-Minute Diagnostic Confusion Assessment Method two times per day. The severity and duration of POD, the incidence of emergence delirium, postoperative pain, quality of sleep, cognitive function, and the plasma concentrations of acetylcholine, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, tumour necrosis factor-α and incidence of adverse events will be evaluated as secondary outcomes.

Postoperative pain is an important factor in the development of delirium, and effective pain management can reduce the risk of POD. Thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) can effectively relieve postoperative pain and inhibit the perioperative stress and inflammatory response. We investigated whether the combination of TPVB with general anesthesia reduced the occurrence of POD following thoracoscopic lobectomy. METHODS: A total of 338 elderly patients, aged 65-80 years, who underwent elective surgery for video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy (VATS) were randomly assigned to either a patient-controlled intravenous analgesia group (PIA) or a patient-controlled paravertebral-block analgesia group (PBA). POD was evaluated using the 3-min diagnostic confusion assessment method (3D-CAM). The postoperative quality of recovery (QoR) was assessed with Chinese version of QoR-40 scale. Pain intensity was measured using the visual analog scale (VAS) score. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and neurofilament light (NFL) levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. RESULTS: Delirium occurred in 47 (28%) of 168 cases in the PIA group and 28 (16.5%) of 170 cases in the PBA group (RR 1.7, p = 0.03). PBA was also associated with a higher rate of overall recovery quality at day 7 after surgery (27.1% vs. 17.3%, P = 0.013) compared with PIA. The incremental change in surgery-induced TNF-α and NFL was greater in the PIA group than PBA group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Thoracic paravertebral block analgesia is associated with lower incidence of postoperative delirium, probably due to its anti-neuroinflammatory effects. Furthermore, as a component of multimodal analgesia, TPVB provides not only superior analgesic but also opioid-sparing effects.

I.",Functional Improvement Trajectories After Surgery (FIT After Surgery) study: protocol for a multicentre prospective cohort study to evaluate significant new disability after major surgery in older adults,"INTRODUCTION: Older adults prioritise surviving surgery, but also preservation of their functional status and quality of life. Current approaches to measure postoperative recovery, which focus on death, complications and length of hospitalisation, may miss key relevant domains. We propose that postoperative disability is an important patient-centred outcome to measure intermediate-to-long recovery after major surgery in older adults. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Functional Improvement Trajectories After Surgery (FIT After Surgery) study is a multicentre cohort study of 2000 older adults (≥65 years) having major non-cardiac surgery. Its objectives are to characterise the incidence, trajectories, risk factors and impact of new significant disability after non-cardiac surgery. Disability is assessed using WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) 2.0 instrument and participants' level-of-care needs. Disability assessments occur before surgery, and at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after surgery. The primary outcome is significantly worse WHODAS score or death at 6 months after surgery. Secondary outcomes are (1) significantly worse WHODAS score or death at 1 year after surgery, (2) increased care needs or death at 6 months after surgery and (3) increased care needs or death at 1 year after surgery. We will use multivariable logistic regression models to determine the association of preoperative characteristics and surgery type with outcomes, joint modelling to characterise longitudinal time trends in WHODAS scores over 12 months after surgery, and longitudinal latent class mixture models to identify clusters following similar trajectories of disability. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The FIT After Surgery study has received research ethics board approval at all sites. Recruitment began in December 2019 but was placed on hold in March 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Recruitment was gradually restarted in October 2020, with 1-year follow-up expected to finish in 2023.

P., Major, S., Spies, C., Lachmann, G., Koch, S.",Increased Direct Current-Electroencephalography Shifts During Induction of Anesthesia in Elderly Patients Developing Postoperative Delirium,"Background: Changes in the direct current (DC) electroencephalography (EEG), so-called DC shifts, are observed during hypoxia, hypo-/hypercapnia, anesthetic administration, epileptic seizures, and spreading depolarizations. They are associated with altered cerebral ion currents across cell membranes and/or the blood–brain barrier (BBB). Here, we measured DC shifts in clinical practice during hyperventilation (HV) and anesthesia induction, and investigated whether such DC shifts correlate with the occurrence of postoperative delirium (POD) in older patients. Methods: In this prospective observational study (subproject of the BioCog study, NCT02265263; EA2/092/14), a continuous pre- and perioperative DC-EEG was recorded in patients aged ≥65 years. The preoperative DC-EEG included a 2 min HV with simultaneous measurement of end-tidal CO2. Of the perioperative recordings, DC-EEG segments were chosen from a 30 s period at the start of induction of anesthesia (IOA), loss of consciousness (LOC), and during a stable anesthetic phase 30 min after skin incision (intraOP). The DC shift at Cz was determined in μV/s. All patients were screened twice daily for the first seven postoperative days for the occurrence of POD. DC-EEG shifts were compared in patients with (POD) and without postoperative delirium (noPOD). Results: Fifteen patients were included in this subproject of the BioCog study. DC shifts correlated significantly with concurrent HV, with DC shifts increasing the more end-tidal CO2 decreased (P = 0.001, Spearman’s rho 0.862). During the perioperative DC-EEG, the largest DC shift was observed at LOC during IOA. POD patients (n = 8) presented with significantly larger DC shifts at LOC [POD 31.6 (22.7; 38.9) μV/s vs. noPOD 4.7 (2.2; 12.5) μV/s, P = 0.026]. Conclusion: DC shifts can be observed during HV and IOA in routine clinical practice. At anesthesia induction, the DC shift was greatest at the time of LOC, with POD patients presenting with significantly stronger DC shifts. This could indicate larger changes in gas tensions, hypotension and impaired cerebral autoregulation or BBB dysfunction in these patients.

We accessed the effect of intraoperative intravenous dexmedetomidine on postoperative sleep quality in patients with endoscopic sinus surgery.  METHODS: This single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial enrolled a total of 110 participants aged 18 years to 65 years who were scheduled to receive endoscopic sinus surgery. Placebo (normal saline) or dexmedetomidine infusion (load dose 0.5 μg kg(-1) over 10 min, followed by maintenance dose 0.2 ug kg(-1) h(-1)) during surgery. The primary outcome was postoperative sleep quality. Secondary outcomes were postoperative Ramsay sedation scores, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores, serum cortisol, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and hypocretin, delirium, and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). RESULTS: Among enrolled 110 patients, 55 were randomized to administer intraoperative dexmedetomidine and placebo. In total, 14 patients (7 in each group) were excluded because of protocol deviations, and 96 patients (48 in each group) were included in the per-protocol analysis. The dexmedetomidine group had a significantly higher sleep efficiency index(SEI) (66.85[3.00] vs 65.38[3.58]), the ratio of rapid eye movement sleep to total sleep(REM)(13.63[1.45] vs 12.38[2.11]) and lower arousal index (AI) (7.20[1.00] vs 8.07[1.29]), higher Ramsay sedation score at post-operation 1 h, 12 h point, lower VAS scores at post-operation 1 h, 12 h, 24 h point, lower cortisol, higher 5-HT and hypocretin in serum than the placebo group.

However, the mechanisms of action of dexmedetomidine during the neuroinflammatory response that underlies POCD remain largely unknown. We found that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced substantial inflammatory responses in primary and BV2 microglial cells. The screening of differentially expressed miRNAs revealed that miR-103a-3p was downregulated in these cell culture models. Overexpression of miR-103a-3p mimics and inhibitors suppressed and enhanced the release of inflammatory factors, respectively. VAMP1 expression was upregulated in LPS-treated primary and BV-2 microglial cells, and it was validated as a downstream target of miR-103-3p. VAMP1-knockdown significantly inhibited the LPS-induced inflammatory response. Dexmedetomidine treatment markedly inhibited LPS-induced inflammation and the expression of VAMP1, and miR-103a-3p expression reversed this inhibition. Moreover, dexmedetomidine mitigated microglial activation and the associated inflammatory response in a rat model of surgical trauma that mimicked POCD. In this model, dexmedetomidine reversed miR-103a-3p and VAMP1 expression; this effect was abolished by miR-103a-3p overexpression.

To date, the development of PND biomarkers remains a challenge. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 (hnRNPA2/B1) is an RNA-binding protein whose prion-like structure is prone to mutation and hence leads to neurodegenerative diseases, but its expression changes in PND remains unclear. Here, we detect the preoperative hnRNPA2/B1 level in patients with PND, and to explore its value in the prediction and diagnosis of PND. Methods: The study included 161 elderly patients undergoing lumbar decompression and fusion in Nankai University Affinity the Third Central Hospital from September 2021 to July 2022. Neuropsychological and psychometric evaluations were performed before surgery, 1 week and 3 months after surgery to diagnose the occurrence of PND, then the peripheral blood was collected from patients before induction of anesthesia. The concentration in plasma of hnRNPA2/B1 and amyloid-β 42 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The median fluorescence intensity and mRNA levels of hnRNPA2/B1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was detected by indirect intracellular staining flow cytometry and quantitative real-time PCR, respectively. Results: The preoperative hnRNPA2/B1 level in patients with PND was higher both in short-time and long-time follow-up. We found significantly higher concentrations of hnRNPA2/B1 in PND at 7 days after surgery (median, 72.26 pg/mL vs. 54.95 pg/mL, p = 0.022) compared with patients without PND, and so as 3 months after surgery (median, 102.93 pg/mL vs. 56.38 pg/mL, p = 0.012). The area under the curve (AUC) was predicted to be 0.686 at 7 days after surgery and 0.735 at 3 months. In addition, when combining several clinical information, the diagnostic efficiency of hnRNPA2/B1 for PND could further increase (AUC, 0.707 at 7 days, 0.808 at 3 months).

METHODS: About 168 patients, aged 65-80 years and scheduled for laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery, were randomized to 2 mg/kg methylprednisolone (Group M, n = 84) or equivalent dose of placebo (Group C, n = 84). The primary outcome was the incidence of delirium during the first 5 days after surgery, assessed by the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). POD severity was rated daily using CAM-Severity (CAM-S). Levels of syndecan-1, heparan sulfate, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were measured at baseline, 1 day, and 3 days after surgery. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, methylprednisolone greatly reduced the incidence of delirium at 72 hours following surgery (9 [10.7%] vs 20 [23.8%], p = .03, OR = 2.22 [95% CI 1.05-4.59]). No between-group difference was found in the cumulative CAM-S score (p = .14). The levels of heparan sulfate, syndecan-1, and TNF-α in Group M were lower than that in Group C (p < .05 and p < .01), while the level of BDNF in Group M was higher than that in Group C (p < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative administration of methylprednisolone does not reduce the severity of POD, but may reduce the incidence of delirium after gastrointestinal surgery in older patients, which may be related to a reduction in circulating markers of endothelial degradation, followed by the increase of BDNF level.

H.",Dexmedetomidine Combined with Femoral Nerve Block Provides Effective Analgesia Similar to Femoral Nerve Combined with Sciatic Nerve Block in Patients Undergoing Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Randomized Controlled Study,"BACKGROUND: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a severe traumatic procedure, and femoral nerve block (FNB) combined with a sciatic nerve block (SNB) is widely used in TKA. However, injury of the sciatic nerve is clinically reported. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) could reduce stress and inflammation, as well as improve pain in TKA. This study aims to observe the analgesic impact of DEX combined with FNB in TKA. METHODS: Eighty-eight patients undergoing TKA were included and randomly divided into two groups: DF group (FNB combined with DEX 0.6μg/kg before surgery, followed by DEX 0.2-0.4μg/kg/h until articular closure) and SF group (FNB combined with SNB). Each nerve was blocked with 0.375% ropivacaine 20mL, and all patients received general anesthesia routinely. The primary endpoint was the pain visual analog scale (VAS) score during activities at postoperative 24 hours. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference in the pain VAS scores at any time point. The mean duration of analgesia for patients with rescue analgesic requests was comparable between the two groups: 25.4 ± 6.3 hours in the DF group vs 24.8 ± 6.4 hours in the SF group (two-sample t-test, p=0.738). The total dose of sufentanil was similar between groups (P=0.355). The maintenance dose of propofol and dose of rescue analgesics were comparable (all P>0.05). There were no statistical differences in the incidence of adverse events. However, the time to extubate in the DF group was significantly longer than those in the SF group (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: DEX combined with FNB could provide effective analgesia similar to SNB combined with FNB in TKA.

The impact of regional anesthesia (RA) techniques on CPSP remains conflicting. In this propensity score-matched cohort study, we aimed to investigate the effect of preoperative single-shot erector spinae plane block (ESPB) adding to general anesthesia (GA) on the incidence of CPSP at 1 year following BCS. Methods: Data of adult female patients who underwent unilateral BCS between October 2019 and June 2020 were retrospectively collected. Patients were grouped to ESPB combined with GA (ESPB + GA) and GA alone, respectively. All patients were prospectively followed up at 1 year after surgery. CPSP and neuropathic pain (NP) were measured using the brief pain inventory–short form (BPI-SF) and ID Pain scale. Eleven confounding factors were managed by propensity score matching (PSM) to achieve between-group balance. The primary outcome was the incidence of CPSP at 1 year after BCS. The secondary outcomes include proportion of NP, severity, and interference of CPSP at 1 year after surgery, acute postoperative pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), hospital length of stay (LOS), and adverse events. Results: After PSM, data for 194 patients were available for analysis (97 in each group). No significant difference in the incidence of CPSP (P = 1.000) nor percentage of patients with NP (P = 0.442) was found between the two groups. Both matched groups had similar intensity of CPSP (P = 0.547) measured by BPI-SF as well as the rates of moderate to severe CPSP (P = 1.000). A significant decrease in acute pain scores (P = 0.043) and rates of rescue analgesics demand (P = 0.042) were observed in the ESPB + GA group compared to the GA group. Multivariate logistic regression on the total study cohort showed that axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) (OR 3.541, 95% CI: 1.273–9.851, P = 0.015), radiotherapy (OR 1.918, 95% CI: 1.067–3.448, P = 0.029) and acute postoperative pain within 24 h (OR 2.109, 95% CI: 1.097–4.056, P = 0.036) were independent risk factors for the development of CPSP. Conclusions: We found that preoperative single-shot ESPB was not associated with reduced incidence of CPSP at 1 year after BCS. ALND, radiotherapy, and acute postoperative pain within 24 h were independent risk factors for the development of CPSP after BCS.

Lower preoperative serum uric acid level may be a risk factor for postoperative delirium in older patients undergoing hip fracture surgery: a matched retrospective case-control study.

The mechanism of POD may be associated with the oxidative stress process. Uric acid has been shown to provide a neuroprotective effect in various neurodegenerative diseases through its antioxidant properties. However, it is unclear whether lower preoperative serum uric acid levels are associated with the development of POD after hip fracture surgery. Therefore, this study assessed the association of lower preoperative uric acid levels in patients with POD during hospitalization. METHODS: This is a matched retrospective case-control study that included 96 older patients (≥65 y) who underwent hip fracture surgery. POD was diagnosed using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. Patients diagnosed with POD (cases) were matched 1:1 with patients without POD (controls) on the basis of age, sex, and anesthesia type. The relationship between preoperative uric acid and POD was analyzed by multivariable analysis. RESULTS: The POD and non-POD groups each had 48 patients. In the univariate analysis, lower log preoperative serum uric acid value, higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and cerebrovascular disease were more likely in patients with POD than in those with no POD. Multivariable conditional logistic regression analysis showed that lower log preoperative serum uric acid (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.028; confidence interval [CI], 0.001-0.844; p = 0.040), higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (aOR, 1.314; 95% CI, 1.053-1.638; p = 0.015), and increased surgery duration (aOR, 1.034; 95% CI, 1.004-1.065; p = 0.024) were associated with increased risk of POD. CONCLUSIONS: Lower preoperative serum uric acid levels may be an independent risk factor for POD after adjustment for possible confounding factors. However, large prospective studies are needed to confirm this finding.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16919,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Methods: This retrospective study analyzed data of 60 elderly patients treated with unilateral artificial THA from January 2021 to February 2022. Among them, 30 patients anesthetized using Dex-assisted ultrasound-guided lower extremity nerve block were regarded as the research group (RG), and 30 patients anesthetized with the use of subarachnoid block were considered as the control group (CG). Serum interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) levels were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (Elisa) in patients. Also, the heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured before, 10 min and 60 min after the anesthesia. The cognitive function was evaluated before anesthesia, as well as 2 h, 6 h and 36 h after anesthesia. The adverse reactions during hospitalization were recorded, and the incidence of adverse reactions was calculated. Results: IL-1β and IL-6 levels in both groups after operation were higher than those before operation (P>0.05), but those in the RG were lower than those in the CG (P<0.05). The HR and MAP at 10 min after anesthesia were lower than those before anesthesia (P<0.05). After anesthesia, the HR and MAP at 60 min in the RG were higher than those at 10 min in the CG, while the two in the RG were lower than those in the CG at 60 min (P<0.05). In addition, the postoperative pain score of the RG was lower than that of the CG, while the cognitive score of the RG was higher than that of the CG (P<0.05). There was no marked difference in the incidence of adverse reactions between the two groups (P>0.05). Conclusion: Dex-assisted ultrasound-guided lower extremity nerve block can effectively inhibit the postoperative inflammation, improve the cognitive function, and benefit the postoperative rehabilitation in elderly patients undergoing THA.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16830,Search update 2023-11-13,,

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 260 patients who underwent ACDF with the Zero-P Implant System and had at least 2 year of follow-up were performed. All patients were divided into a non-dysphagia group and a dysphagia group. Sex, age, body mass index (BMI), intraoperative time, estimated blood loss, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking, alcohol consumption, prevertebral soft-tissue thickness, the levels of surgery, O-C(2) angle, C(2-7) angle, T(1) slope and segmental angle were analyzed. The Modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scoring system was used to determine functional status. NDI was used to evaluate neck pain and disability. The Bazaz grading system was chosen to evaluate dysphagia after surgery. Postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage, infection, and dysphagia were recorded in both groups. An independent t-test was used to compare quantitative variables, a chi-square test was used to compare qualitative data between the two groups. To eliminate the influence of confounding factors, logistic regression was performed for multifactor regression of factors. The results were regarded as significant when the P-values were less than 0.05 in this study. RESULTS: In total, the non-dysphagia group comprised 70 patients and the dysphagia group comprised 190 patients, with an average age of 58.33 ± 4.68 years (ranging, 42-82 years). These patients were followed up for 28.5 ± 3.5 months (range, 24-32 months). For clinical outcomes, both groups demonstrated significant improvement in the NDI and JOA scores (P < 0.001). According to the Bazaz dysphagia grading system, mild, moderate, and severe dysphagia were found in 50, 17, and 3 patients, respectively. In total, 37.1% (n = 26) had resolved by 3 month, 38.6% (n = 27) by 6 months, and 17.1% (n = 12) by 12 months. Chi-square test results indicated that number of operated levels, operation time dT1 slope, dO-C(2) angle, dC(2-7) angle, segmental angle and dPSTT were associated with a high incidence of dysphagia. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that number of operated levels, operation time, dC(2-7) angle and dPSTT were significantly associated with postoperative dysphagia. CONCLUSIONS: More operated levels, more operation time, more dC(2-7) angle and dPSTT were the risk factors for postoperative dysphagia. In additional, sufficient preoperative preparation, evaluation combined with proficient and precise surgical treatment were suggested to reduce the incidence of postoperative dysphagia when ACDF was performed.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 10391,Search update 2023-11-13,,

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a machine learning model to predict the postoperative outcome of decompression surgery for patients with LSS. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: A multicentered retrospective study. PATIENT SAMPLE: A total of 848 patients who underwent decompression surgery for LSS at an academic hospital, tertiary center, and private hospital were included (age 71±9 years, 68% male, 91% LSS, level treated 1.8±0.8, operation time 69±37 minutes, blood loss 48±113 mL, and length of hospital stay 12±5 days). OUTCOME MEASURES: Baseline and 2 years postoperative health-related quality of life. METHODS: The subjects were randomly assigned in a 7:3 ratio to a model building cohort and a testing cohort to test the models' accuracy. Twelve predictive algorithms using 68 preoperative factors were used to predict each domain of the Japanese Orthopedic Association Back Pain Evaluation Questionnaire and visual analog scale scores at 2 years postoperatively. The final predictive values were generated using an ensemble of the top five algorithms in prediction accuracy. RESULTS: The correlation coefficients of the top algorithms for each domain established using the preoperative factors were excellent (correlation coefficient: 0.95-0.97 [relative error: 0.06-0.14]). The performance evaluation of each Japanese Orthopedic Association Back Pain Evaluation Questionnaire domain and visual analog scale score by the ensemble of the top five algorithms in the testing cohort was favorable (mean absolute error [MAE] 8.9-17.4, median difference [MD] 8.1-15.6/100 points), with the highest accuracy for mental status (MAE 8.9, MD 8.1) and the lowest for buttock and leg numbness (MAE 1.7, MD 1.6/10 points). A strong linear correlation was observed between the predicted and measured values (linear correlation 0.82-0.89), while 4% to 6% of the subjects had predicted values of greater than±3 standard deviations of the MAE. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully developed a machine learning model to predict the postoperative outcomes of decompression surgery for patients with LSS using patient data from three different institutions in three different settings. Thorough analyses for the subjects with deviations from the actual measured values may further improve the predictive probability of this model.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16888,Search update 2023-11-13,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a total of 415 consecutive patients who underwent major urologic cancer surgery and were screened preoperatively using the G8 and the IADL-modified G8 at our institution between January 2020 and July 2021. For both the G8 and the IADL-modified G8, a cut-off value of 14 was used. All patients underwent perioperative management according to the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery protocol formulated at our institution. Delirium was diagnosed using the Confusion Assessment Method. The relationship between these screening tests and clinical variables was examined. Predictive accuracy was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). To determine the risk factors for the occurrence of postoperative delirium, univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of the 415 patients, 160 (39%) were assigned to the low G8 (score ≤ 14) group and 166 (40%) to the low IADL-modified G8 (score ≤ 14) group. The median age of the patients was 72 years. Postoperative delirium occurred in 31 patients (7%). The AUC values for predicting postoperative delirium were 0.69 for the G8 and 0.71 for the IADL-modified G8. Multivariate analysis for the G8 showed that G8 ≤ 14 (odds ratio [OR] = 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2-6.0; P = 0.02), preoperative use of benzodiazepine (OR = 3.8; 95% CI = 1.6-8.6; P = 0.002), and operative time ≥ 237 min (OR = 3.3; 95% CI = 1.5-7.1; P = 0.003) were independent risk factors for postoperative delirium.

To explore the effect of combined etomidate-ketamine anesthesia on perioperative electrocardiogram (ECG) and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) of elderly patients with rheumatic heart valve disease (RHVD) undergoing heart valve replacement. Methods. The data of 100 elderly RHVD patients treated in our hospital from May 2019 to May 2020 were selected for the retrospective analysis, and by adopting the double-blind method, the patients were divided into the ketamine group (n = 50) and the combined group (n = 50) according to the anesthesia methods. During the induction of anesthesia, the patients of the two groups were given a small dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) at 5 μg/kg/min continuously via pump injection until the end of surgery, and on this basis, with the same anesthesia measures, those in the combined group were given etomidate (0.3 mg/kg) additionally. The patients' perioperative ECG indicators, POCD scores, and Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) scores were compared between the two groups. Results. Compared with the ketamine group, the combined group presented significantly lower incidence of ST-T wave changes after anesthesia induction and at the time of intubation and skin incision (P<0.05), significantly lower average magnitude of ST-segment depression after anesthesia induction (P<0.001), significantly lower average magnitude of ST-segment elevation after anesthesia induction and extubation (P<0.001), significantly lower POCD incidence (6.%, P<0.05), and significantly better NRS score after surgery (P<0.001).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective database analysis was performed based on Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 2005 to 2014. Patients who underwent THA were included. Patient demographics, hospital characteristics, length of stay (LOS), total charges during hospitalization, in-hospital mortality, preoperative comorbidities, and perioperative complications were assessed. RESULTS: The general incidence of HAPUs after THA was 0.05%, with a fluctuating trend annually. Patients suffered from HAPUs were older, less likely through elective admission, more likely in large hospital, more usage of Medicare, and less possibly paying via Private insurance. Additionally, the occurrence of HAPUs was associated with more preoperative comorbidities, longer LOS, extra total charges, and higher in-hospital mortality. Risk factors associated with HAPUs included advanced age (≥75 years), large hospital, multiple comorbidities (n ≥ 3), diabetes with chronic complications, drug abuse, liver disease, fluid and electrolyte disorders, metastatic cancer, peripheral vascular disorders, psychoses, chronic renal failure, peptic ulcer disease, and weight loss. Besides, HAPUs were associated with inflammatory arthritis and femoral neck fracture (compared with primary/secondary osteoarthritis), frailty/senility, osteoporosis, acute renal failure, pneumonia, postoperative delirium, urinary tract infection, deep vein thrombosis, sepsis/septicemia, wound dehiscence/non-healing surgical wound, periprosthetic joint infection, and mechanical prosthesis-related complications.

After adjusting for all covariates, frailty was significantly associated with postoperative complications in hospital by FRAIL [odds ratio: 5.11, 95% CI: 1.41–18.44, P = 0.013], by FI [OR: 4.25, 95% CI: 1.21–14.90, P = 0.024] and by CFS [OR: 5.10, 95% CI: 1.52–17.17, P = 0.008]. The area under the curve (AUC) for SASA was 0.768 (95% CI: 0.702–0.826). Addition of frailty assessment (FRAIL, FI and CFS) increased the AUC to 0.787 (95% CI: 0.722–0.842), 0.798 (95% CI: 0.734–0.852), and 0.815 (95% CI: 0.753–0.867), respectively. Compared to SASA, only addition of CFS had a significant difference (P = 0.0478). Conclusion: Frailty is an effective predictor of postoperative complications in elderly Chinese patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery. Frailty assessment of CFS can better improve the predictive ability of SASA. © 2022 Yin et al.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 10963,Search update 2023-11-13,,

We assessed whether there is a difference in postoperative delirium and composite morbidity between patients receiving GA with PNB and GA alone using a national clinical database in Japan. Methods We compared the outcomes of patients receiving GA with PNB and GA alone from April 2016 to October 2019. The primary outcome was postoperative delirium, defined as a status requiring newly prescribed antipsychotic drugs or that given the code of a reimbursable disease after the surgery date. The secondary outcome was morbidity incidence as the occurrence of at least one of any of the following life-threatening complications. We conducted propensity score-matched analyses using covariates for patients who underwent any surgical procedure. We used instrumental variables and restricted the definition of postoperative delirium and subgroup for sensitivity analyses. Results Of 653,759 patients, 90,358 received GA-PNB and 563,401 received only GA. After 1:4 propensity score matching, 89,754 patients were included in the GA-PNB and 359,015 in the GA.

A Cochrane Review found no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative delirium between total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and inhalational anesthesia (IA). This study evaluated the differences in postoperative delirium and morbidity between patients who underwent either TIVA or IA. METHODS: A nationwide Japanese inpatient database was used to retrospectively compare differences in postoperative delirium and composite morbidity between patients older than 65 years, who underwent general anesthesia (TIVA or IA). The primary outcome was postoperative delirium. The secondary outcomes were: morbidity incidence, length of hospital stay, and mortality. A 1:3 propensity score analysis of patients who underwent all surgical procedures was conducted according to covariates, to calculate odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Sensitivity analyses were conducted using an instrumental variable analysis of the proportion of TIVA by hospital scale, stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting analyses, limiting the definitions of postoperative delirium, and subgroup analysis. RESULTS: Of 738,600 patients, 149,540 received TIVA and 589,060 received IA.

Anaesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine.  2022. 23:702-706","Young, S., Basavaraju, A.",General anaesthesia for ophthalmic surgery,"The majority of ophthalmic surgeries are performed as day cases under topical or regional anaesthesia with or without intravenous sedation. However, general anaesthesia is necessary in certain circumstances e.g. local anaesthetic allergy or patients who are unable to cooperate or to lie flat or still. Patients for ophthalmic surgery are frequently elderly with multiple comorbidities, such as diabetes and hypertension. Patients with rare genetic syndromes may present for eye surgery. Therefore adequate preoperative evaluation and preparation will minimize perioperative complications. The goals of general anaesthesia are smooth induction and emergence, with stable intra-ocular pressure (IOP) and akinesia of the globe. These can be achieved with a combination of intravenous and inhalational agents with or without muscle relaxants and opiates. Use of the laryngeal mask airway has the advantage of causing a smaller rise in IOP on insertion and less coughing on emergence. Total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol and remifentanil has the advantages of causing less postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), reduced stress response to airway intervention, rapid recovery and smooth emergence. Some eye procedures require special consideration, for example, strabismus and vitreoretinal surgery involves traction of the rectus muscles producing a higher incidence of oculocardiac reflex and PONV. Most ophthalmic surgery produces mild to moderate pain amenable to non-opioid analgesics. Intraoperative topical and regional anaesthesia reduce postoperative pain and opiate requirement. Open globe injury and a full stomach present unique challenges to prevent increase in IOP as well as protecting the airway.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 13412,Search update 2023-11-13,,

However, influence of Dex on postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in the elderly remains unknown. Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effect of Dex on POCD. Relevant studies were obtained by search of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane's Library databases. A random-effect model was used to pool the results. Results: Fourteen RCTs including 1626 adults of 60 years or older who received surgery with general anesthesia were included. Because methodologically diverse scales were used for POCD, eight RCTs with POCD diagnosed with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were included in the meta-analysis, while the remaining six RCTs with POCD diagnosed with other scales were qualitative synthesized. Pooled results of RCTs with MMSE showed that Dex significantly reduced the incidence of POCD (risk ratio: 0.47, 95% confidence interval: 0.37–0.60, p < 0.001) with no significant heterogeneity (I2 = 0%) or publication bias (p for Egger's regression test = 0.579). For the remaining six RCTs with POCD diagnosed with other scales, three of them showed that Dex was associated with a significantly lower incidence of POCD, while the other three RCTs did not show a significant difference. Conclusions: Dex is associated with a reduced risk of POCD in elderly patients receiving surgeries with general anesthesia, and the results were mainly obtained in studies with POCD diagnosed with MMSE. Based on these findings, Dex may be considered as a preventative measure for POCD in elderly patients.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16740,Search update 2023-11-13,,

However, the stability of hemodynamics during anesthesia induction in patients undergoing valve replacement surgery is difficult to maintain due to their impaired cardiac function. Remimazolam, a novel and ultrashort-acting intravenous sedative-hypnotic, may be beneficial to stable hemodynamics, but the evidence is limited. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effect of remimazolam induction on hemodynamics compared with midazolam and etomidate in patients undergoing valve replacement surgery. METHODS: This is a prospective, multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT). Three hundred and sixty-three non-obese adult patients aged 45 to 80 years old undergoing valve surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass will be randomly allocated to receive remimazolam tosilate, midazolam, or etomidate during anesthetic induction. The primary outcome is the incidence of hypotension within 20 min after the administration of investigated drugs. The hypotension is defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 90 mmHg or a 30% reduction in SBP from baseline or the application of vasoactive drugs. Secondary outcomes include incidence of successful sedation, time to successful sedation, incidence of delirium and postoperative low cardiac output syndrome within 7 days after surgery, hospital mortality, mechanical ventilation time, ICU length of stay, and hospital length of stay. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first prospective RCT to investigate the efficacy and safety of remimazolam induction in adult cardiac surgery compared with midazolam and etomidate. This study will provide important information on the application of remimazolam in cardiac surgery in the future. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry chictr.org.cn ChiCTR2100050122.

Postoperative neurocognitive disorders can exhibit as short-term postoperative delirium and/or long-term postoperative cognitive dysfunction. In addition, postoperative neurocognitive disorders may result in poor outcomes in patients, and are a leading cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality, particularly in elderly patients. Recently, there has been a heightened interest in mechanisms and clinical treatments for postoperative neurocognitive disorders. Though some influencing factors and mechanisms of postoperative neurocognitive disorders have been revealed, they remain troublesome problems in clinical departments. Dexmedetomidine is a commonly used anesthetic adjuvant that may help improve postoperative cognitive impairment, especially the conditions of a postoperative acute event (postoperative delirium, within 1 week after operation) and delayed neurocognitive recovery (postoperative cognitive dysfunction, up to 30 days). In the recent literature, dexmedetomidine has been shown to exert positive effects on cognitive impairment in clinical and animal studies, especially for postoperative neurocognitive disorders. However, not all clinical findings support this efficacy. Though some mechanisms of dexmedetomidine on postoperative neurocognitive disorders have been proposed, such as signaling pathways associated with inflammation and apoptosis, this evidence is fragmentary and disputed in the literature. Therefore, this article aims to review the potential biological mechanisms underlying dexmedetomidine's effects on postoperative neurocognitive disorders, providing a reference for future studies.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16722,Search update 2023-11-13,,

We designed this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the effect of TPVB on blood coagulation in patients after thoracoscopic lobectomy. Patients and Methods: Sixty patients scheduled for thoracoscopic lobectomy were randomly allocated to two groups. Patients underwent ultrasound-guided TPVB with 0.33% ropivacaine (T group) or 0.9% saline (C group) at the end of the surgery under general anesthesia. Patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) was administered for both group after the surgery. The primary outcome was the thromboelastogram (TEG) parameters before anesthesia (T0), at the end of operation (T1) and in 1 day (T2) and 2 days (T3) after the operation, the second outcomes were the analgesic effect and the amount of intraoperative opioid consumption, operation time, infusion volume, blood loss and urine volume. Results: The visual analog scale (VAS) scores in group T were lower than group C (P < 0.05).

However, evidence for recommending screening of dehydration is insufficient and its relation with frailty and mortality is unclear. We tested the hypothesis that postoperative HD is associated with frailty and increased mortality. METHODS: We recruited 625 older (>65 years) patients surgically treated for hip fracture and co-managed by an orthogeriatric team over one year in 2017. Pre- and postoperative HD (serum osmolarity > 300 mmol/L) was diagnosed. Frailty and associated mortality risk were assessed by the Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI). RESULTS: The prevalence of preoperative HD was 20.4%. Compared with no-HD, MPI was similar in HD patients despite higher (p < 0.05) prevalence of polypharmacy, arterial hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and heart failure. After surgery the incidence of HD decreased to 16.5%, but increased (p = 0.003) in the MPI high-risk subgroup. Postoperative HD was associated with more complications and was an independent determinant of adjusted hospital length of stay (LOS) and of 60- to 365-days mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Older frail patients with hip fracture are prone to developing postoperative HD, which independently predicts prolonged hospital LOS and mortality. Systematically screening older patients for frailty and dehydration is advisable to customize hydration management in high-risk individuals.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 6727,Search update 2023-11-13,,

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 78 patients with bladder cancer who underwent robot-assisted radical cystectomy with intracorporeal urinary diversion at Fujita Health University between 2011 and 2021. Baseline characteristics and perioperative outcomes were compared between the cohorts with and without ileus. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the risk factors for postoperative ileus. RESULTS: Out of the 78 patients included in this study, 20 (25.6%) developed postoperative ileus. The ileus cohort was associated with a significantly lower Geriatric-8 score (P = 0.003) and a higher rate of previous abdominal/pelvic surgery (P = 0.04) compared with those of the nonileus cohort. Significantly longer intestinal tract reconstruction time, hospital stay, time to mobilization, fluid intake, solid intake, flatus, and stool were observed in the ileus cohort. According to the results of the logistic regression analysis, the Geriatric-8 sum (P = 0.009), time to mobilization (P = 0.03), and time to fluid intake (P = 0.004) were independent predictors of postoperative ileus. In the model predicting postoperative ileus, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.716, and the cutoff value of the Geriatric-8 sum was 13. CONCLUSIONS: Early mobilization and fluid intake and low Geriatric-8 scores were significant risk factors for postoperative ileus.

Probably not,"Introduction: Delayed neurocognitive recovery (DNR) is a common post-surgical complication among the elderly. Cognitive frailty (CF) is also an age-related medical syndrome. However, little is known about the association between CF and DNR. Therefore, this study aimed to study whether CF is associated with DNR in elderly patients undergoing elective noncardiac surgery, as well as to explore the potential risk factors for DNR in frail elderly individuals and construct a prediction model. Methods: This prospective cohort study administered a battery of cognitive and frailty screening instruments for 146 individuals (≥65 years old) scheduled for elective noncardiac surgery. Screening for CF was performed at least one day before surgery, and tests for the presence of DNR were performed seven days after surgery. The association between CF and DNR was investigated. Moreover, the study subjects were randomly divided into a modeling group (70%) and a validation group (30%). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed to analyze the modeling group data and identify the independent risk factors for DNR. The R software was used to construct DNR's nomogram model, verifying the model. Results: In total, 138 individuals were eligible. Thirty-three cases were diagnosed with DNR (23.9%). No significant difference in the number of patients with CF was observed between the DNR and non-DNR groups (P > 0.05). Multivariate analysis after adjusting relevant risk factors showed that only the judgment of line orientation (JLOT) test score significantly affected the incidence of DNR. After internal validation of the constructed DNR prediction model, the area under the curve (AUC) of the forecast probability for the modeling population (n = 97) for DNR was 0.801, and the AUC for the validation set (n = 41) was 0.797. The calibration curves of both the modeling and validation groups indicate that the prediction model has good stability. Conclusion: Cognitive frailty is not an independent risk factor in predicting DNR after noncardiac surgery in frail elderly individuals. The preoperative JLOT score is an independent risk factor for DNR in frail elderly individuals. The prediction model has a good degree of discrimination and calibration, which means that it can individually predict the risk probability of DNR in frail elderly individuals.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16712,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Recently, vitamin D was shown to improve cognitive dysfunction caused by Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. This study aims to explore the correlation between preoperative serum vitamin D and postoperative cognitive disorder (POCD) occurrence in elderly patients with gastrointestinal tumors to guide perioperative medication use and promote early patient recovery. Methods: This study recruited 238 elderly patients (65 ≤ age ≤ 85) who underwent gastrointestinal tumor surgery; 117 cases were enrolled, and 55 controls of the same age and education level as the cases were included. Blood samples were taken preoperatively and at 7, 15, 30, and 90 days postoperatively, and plasma vitamin D (25OH-D3) and glutathione (GSH) was measured. Different from the previous diagnosis of POCD was obtained by telephone interview through Cognitive Status Modified Telephone Interview (TICS-m), mainly for memory impairment, a series of neuropsychological tests was used to evaluate cognitive function, Picture Recollect Test, Stroop Color-word Test, and Digit Symbol Substitution Test were used to comprehensively evaluate the three domains of cognitive function of patients, namely memory, attention and information processing ability. All neuropsychiatric assessments were performed at the bedside and completed face-to-face by the assessment staff and the patient. Results: A total of 65.8% (77/117) of elderly patients undergoing gastrointestinal tumor surgery had preoperative vitamin D deficiency (serum 25OH-D concentration < 12 ng/ml), of whom 46.7% (36/77, 7 days after surgery), 31.2% (24/77, 15 days after surgery), 15.6% (12/77, 30 days after surgery), and 9% (7/77, 90 days after surgery) of patients developed POCD; 7.5% (3/40) of patients without vitamin D deficiency developed PNDs, which was detected only on the 7th day after surgery. Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency can increase neurocognitive disorder risk in elderly patients during the perioperative period, possibly because low vitamin D levels cannot effectively inhibit the postoperative oxidative stress increase.

Methods: We enrolled 90 patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I to III undergoing open abdominal cytoreductive surgery in this study. Patients were randomized and assigned into three groups (TAP-R, TAP-DR, or CON) of 30 participants each. All of the patients received standardized general anesthesia, and postoperative Bd-TAP blocks were performed. The TAP-R, TAP-DR, and CON groups received Bd-TAP blocks with 0.3% ropivacaine, 0.3% ropivacaine and 0.5 μg/kg of dexmedetomidine, and 0.9% normal saline, respectively. All of the patients received patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) (formula, 100 μg of sufentanil and 16 mg of ondansetron diluted with normal saline to 100 mL). Flurbiprofen axetil was used as a rescue drug if the visual analog scale (VAS) score was more than four points. The first request time for PCA bolus; the VAS scores at 0, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after operation; and the cumulative sufentanil consumption within 24 and 48 h, respectively, were compared. Pulmonary function was evaluated preoperatively and at 24 h after the operation. The use of the rescue drug was recorded. Postoperative functional recovery, including time to stand, time to walk, time to return of bowel function, time to readiness for discharge, and postoperative complications, were recorded. Results: Median values of the first request time for PCA of the TAP-R group was significantly prolonged compared to that of the CON group (median [interquartile range], 7.3 [6.5–8.0] hours vs. 3.0 [2.3–3.5] hours) (P <.001), while the TAP-DR group has the longest request time among the three groups (median [interquartile range], 13.5 [12.4–14.5] hours) (P <.001). The VAS scores at rest and upon coughing of the TAP-R group in the first 12 h were significantly lower than those of the CON group (P < 0.05), but showed no significant difference compared to those of the TAP-DR group. The VAS scores at rest and upon coughing were lower in the TAP-DR group at each time point compared to those of the CON group (P <.05). The cumulative sufentanil consumption in the TAP-DR group was significantly lower at 48 h (P =.04) after surgery than in the CON group, while there was no significant difference compared to that in the TAP-R group (P >.05). Less rescue analgesic was required by patients in the TAP-DR group than in the CON group (P <.05). Postoperative mean measured forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and FEV1/forced vital capacity values in the TAP-DR group were significantly higher than those of the CON group (P =.009), while there was no significant difference compared to those of the TAP-R group (P =.10). There was no significantly difference in postoperative functional recovery between TAP-DR and CON group (P > 0.05). Conclusion: TAP blocks can provide effective pain relief up to 12 h postoperatively without a significant improvement in postoperative pulmonary function. The addition of dexmedetomidine to ropivacaine for Bd-TAP block prolonged the first bolus time of PCA when compared to that in the TAP-R group and decreased sufentanil consumption and the need of rescue analgesia relative to in the CON group at 48 h postoperative. The procedure provided better postoperative analgesia and improved postoperative pulmonary function relative to the CON group. Our results indicate that dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant of Bd-TAP can provide effective pain relief up to 48 h.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 8539,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Also, dexmedetomidine can reduce the minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) of sevoflurane and the risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) induced by sevoflurane anesthesia. But so far, the electroencephalogram (EEG) mechanism of dexmedetomidine deepening sevoflurane anesthesia is not clear. In this study, by analyzing the changes of the power spectrum and bicoherence spectrum of EEG before and after dexmedetomidine infusion, the EEG mechanism of dexmedetomidine deepening sevoflurane anesthesia was studied. We analyzed dexmedetomidine-induced changes in power spectrum and bicoherence spectrum in 23 patients under sevoflurane anesthesia. After anesthesia induction, the sevoflurane concentration was maintained at 0.8 MAC for 15 min, and then dexmedetomidine was administered at a loading dose of 0.8 μg/kg in 10 min, followed by a maintenance rate of 0.5 μg⋅kg–1⋅h–1. Frontal EEG data from 5 min before and 10 min after dexmedetomidine infusion were compared. After dexmedetomidine infusion, the mean α power peak decreased from 6.09 to 5.43 dB and shifted to a lower frequency, the mean θ bicoherence peak increased from 29.57 to 41.25% and shifted to a lower frequency, and the median α bicoherence peak increased from 41.49 to 46.36% and shifted to a lower frequency. These results demonstrate that dexmedetomidine deepens sevoflurane anesthesia, and enhances α and θ bicoherences while shifting peak values of these bands to lower frequencies through regulating thalamo-cortical reverberation networks probably.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16501,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Sevoflurane is the most widely applied anesthetic in clinical practice. In this study, we investigated the effects of the GLP-1 analogue liraglutide on cognitive function in aged rats anesthetized by sevoflurane. Specifically, 48 Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into the control (C) group, the liraglutide (L) group, the sevoflurane (S) group, and the sevoflurane+liraglutide (SL) group, each group with 12 rats. In the S group and the SL group, the rats were injected subcutaneously with normal saline and liraglutide after inhalation of a mixture of 3% sevoflurane and pure oxygen. In the C group and the L group, normal saline and liraglutide were injected subcutaneously into the rats after inhalation of pure oxygen. Morris Water Maze Task was applied for the detection of spatial learning and memory in rats; HE and TUNEL for staining; and western blot for quantifying Bax, Bcl-2 expression, and examining caspase-3 activity in hippocampal tissues as well as for revealing the antiapoptotic mechanism. Besides, the accumulation of inflammatory factors NF-κB and IL-1β in the hippocampal tissue was quantitatively studied to reveal the anti-inflammatory mechanism. The protective effect of liraglutide on sevoflurane toxicity was the first to be confirmed in this study. Additionally, this study elucidated the mechanism of the above effect. The results of this study might be helpful to find an effective medical solution for the treatment of POCD caused by sevoflurane anesthesia.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 6701,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Design: Retrospective study. Setting: A tertiary hospital affiliated to a medical university. Patients/Participants: We retrospectively studied 1285 surgical-treated geriatric patients with a hip fracture from April 2010 to April 2018. Intervention: Surgical treatment was performed on the patients of this study. The procedure methods were classified as: total hip arthroplasty, hemiarthroplasty, percutaneous fixation, intramedullary nail fixation, and plate/screw fixation. Main Outcome Measurement: The primary interest of end point of this study is the development of POP during the postoperative period. The postoperative period in this study was defined as the time from 24 hours after surgery to discharge. The diagnostic criteria for pneumonia were set according to the guidelines built by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society (Guidelines for the Management of Adults with Hospital-Acquired, Ventilator-Associated, and Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia, 2005). Potential variables for developing POP were identified using logistic regression analyses initially and were further selected via the method of LASSO. Then the independent risk factors were identified by multivariable regression analyses. A predictive nomogram was built based on the multiple regression model, and the calibration abilities of the nomogram was measured by Harrel C-index, calibration plot and Hosmer–Lemeshow test, respectively. Decision curve analysis was carried out to assess the net benefit due to threshold probability and an on-line questionnaire survey was conducted among the clinicians to assess the applicability of the nomogram coherently. Results: Of the 1285 patients, 70 (5.4%) developed POP. COPD, number of comorbidities, ASA classification >2, preoperative dependent functional status and cognitive impairment were identified as independent risk factors of POP. The nomogram built based on the results showed good accordance between the predicted probabilities and the observed frequency. The decision curve analysis confirmed the clinical utility of the nomogram when the threshold probabilities were between 5% and 65% due to the net benefit, while the results of on-line questionnaire among 200 clinicians showed that 91.5% of the participants had a mental threshold of intervention between 5-50%. Conclusion: (1). COPD, number of comorbidities, ASA classification >2, preoperative dependent functional status and cognitive impairment are independent risk factors for POP. (2). The nomogram built in this study has a good accordance between the predictive risk and the observational incidence. The results of decision curve and questionnaire among clinicians show well applicability of the nomogram. © The Author(s) 2022.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 11371,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Emerging evidence suggests that frailty is pertinent to the clinical outcomes of older patients with hip fracture. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study on older patients (aged ≥65 years) who underwent orthopedic repair with hip fracture under spinal or general anesthesia between June 1, 2019 and May 31, 2020. Demographic, surgical, and anesthetic features; chart-derived frailty index (CFI); occurrence of complications; and length of stay were retrospectively collected by reviewing patients' anesthesia records and medical charts. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to their CFI: high CFI group (CFI, 3-5) and low CFI group (CFI, 0-2). The CFI was calculated as the addition of the patient's conditions, including age >70 years, preoperative body mass index <18.5 kg/m2, hematocrit <35%, albumin <34 g/L, and serum creatinine >176.8 mol/L (2.0 mg/dL). The EuroQol 5-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D) was obtained through telephone interviews 12 months after surgery to assess mortality and long-term quality of life. RESULTS: During the study period, 381 patients met the inclusion criteria. Patients in the high CFI group had an increased incidence of delirium by 13.80% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.31-21.29) (17 [16.6%] vs 8 [2.8%]; P < .001) compared to patients in the low CFI group. More patients in the high CFI group had pneumonia with an increased incidence of 17.71% (95% CI, 7.08-23.34) (40 [39.2%] vs 60 [21.5%]; P < .001) than patients in the low CFI group. Postoperative hospital stay was significantly longer in the high CFI group (8 [6-12] vs 7 [5-10] days; P = .0222) than in the low CFI group. More patients died in the high CFI group 1 year after surgery with an increased mortality of 19.33% (95% CI, 9.47-29.18) (26.4% [23/87] vs 7.1% [16/225]; P < .001) than patients in the low CFI group. A total of 64 patients in the high CFI group and 209 patients in the low CFI group completed the EQ-5D survey 1 year after surgery. The EQ-5D score in the high CFI group was significantly lower than that in the low CFI group (0.63 ± 0.22 vs 0.72 ± 0.22; P = .002).

The goal of this study was to build a risk assessment model and evaluate its predictive value using the modified frailty index (5-mFI) and the prognostic nutritional index (PNI).Methods: A retrospective investigation was undertaken on 150 patients (aged ≥60 years) who had hip fracture surgery. Using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models, the relationship between combined 5-mFI and PNI and the evaluation of postoperative unfavorable outcomes such as infection and unscheduled intensive care unit (ICU) admission was investigated. Finally, utilizing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, the model's predictive value for adverse outcomes following hip fracture surgery in elderly patients was assessed.Results: Univariate and multivariate logistic analyses revealed that preoperative PNI, 5-mFI, ASA, and gender acted as independent predictors of adverse outcomes after hip fracture surgery in the elderly. According to the ROC curve analysis, the predictive model demonstrated a high predictive value for total postoperative complications (AUC: 0.788; 95%CI: 0.715-0.860; p<0.01), infectious complications (AUC: 0.798; 95% CI: 0.727-0.868; P<0.001), and unplanned ICU admission (AUC: 0.783; 95% CI: 0.705-0.861; P<0.001).Conclusions: The multivariable evaluation model, which included 5-mFI and PNI, showed a high predictive value and can hence be applied to predict the adverse outcomes in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgery.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16915,Search update 2023-11-13,,

The objective of this study was to establish the prognostic accuracy of these indexes in a cohort of patients with colorectal cancer subjected to surgical intervention. METHODS: We performed an observational study including all patients older than 60 years, subjected to colorectal cancer surgery between January 2010 and May 2020, and stratified our cohort based on the presence of frailty, as defined by MSK-FI ≥ 3. Computed tomography was used to calculate SMI, using a standardized institutional protocol. A multivariable analysis was used to study the association between these novel indexes with adverse postoperative outcomes in our cohort. RESULTS: A total of 216 patients were included. Among these, 56 (26%) qualified as frail and 132 (62%) had a low SMI. On multivariable analysis (adjusted by patient and intraoperative characteristics), frailty was associated with increased risk of having a major postoperative complication (OR 29.78, 95%CI 10.36-85.71) and increased admission to the intensive care unit (OR 4.99, 95%CI 1.55-16.06), while both frailty and low SMI were associated with prolonged length of stay (OR 11.22, 95%CI 8.91-13.53 and OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.06-0.20, respectively). CONCLUSION: MSK-FI ≥ 3 and low SMI are associated with adverse postoperative outcomes in elderly patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery. Implementing this practical tool in routine clinical practice, may help identify patients that would benefit from surgical prehabilitation and preoperative optimization to improve outcomes.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16962,Search update 2023-11-13,,

The aim of this study was to investigate the evaluation of postoperative patient-reported pain from intraoperative intravenous infusion of lidocaine in patients undergoing thyroidectomy surgery. METHODS: A total of 40 patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classifications I and II, aged 18-65 years, who were scheduled for elective thyroidectomy with the same indications under general anesthesia at the Ataturk University Medical Faculty's Ear, Nose, and Throat Clinic between November 2019 and February 2020, were divided into two equal groups as randomized and double-blind. Before induction of anesthesia, patients in the lidocaine group were given 1.5 mg/kg lidocaine IV bolus infusion during the operation and until the end of the first postoperative hour, followed by a continuous infusion of 1.5 mg/kg/h. Patients in the control group were given 0.9% isotonic solution according to the same protocol. In the postoperative period, 50 mg of dexketoprofen trometamol was administered and repeated every 12 h. Postoperative pain scores, additional analgesia, and side effects were recorded. RESULTS: Postoperative pain scores were significantly lower in the lidocaine group (n=20) compared to the control group (n=20) at 30 min and 1st, 2nd, 4th, 8th, and 12th h postoperatively (p < 0.05). Additional analgesia requirements were also significantly lower in the lidocaine group than in the control group (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: We recommended the use of intravenous lidocaine infusion intraoperatively in thyroidectomy surgery as it reduces pain scores.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 17002,Search update 2023-11-13,,

METHODS: Preoperative frailty status was assessed by the G8 geriatric screening tool (G8 Score), Lee Schonberg prognostic index, Charlson Comorbidity index and American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status System in women older than 60 years with EC. Univariable and multivariable Cox-regression analyses, as well as Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed to determine the prognostic impact. Statistical analyses were adjusted for cancer entity-specific risk factors such as conventional histopathological tumor characteristics and relevant anamnestic life style parameters. RESULTS: 153 patients with all stages of EC who were operated at the University Medical Center Mainz between 2008 and 2019 were included. In multivariable analyses, only the G8 Score retained independent significance as a prognostic factor for disease-specific survival (DSS) (HR:4.58; 95% CI [1.35-15.51]) and overall survival (OS) (HR:2.89; 95% CI [1.31-6.39]. 92 patients (61.3%) were classified as G8-non-frail with a significantly increased DSS and OS rate compared to the 58 G8-frail patients (DSS:93.8% vs. 60.8%; p < 0.001 and OS:88.2% vs. 49.7%; p < 0.001; respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study demonstrates the substantial clinical and prognostic impact of the G8 Score on survival in elderly women with EC. Assessing the frailty status to estimate the individual vulnerability of elderly cancer patients could be useful in preoperative decision-making to individualize treatment plans such as the surgical radicality and to improve pre- and postoperative morbidity.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 11081,Search update 2023-11-13,,

METHODS: Preoperative frailty status was examined by the G8 questionnaire, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, the Charlson Comorbidity Index and the American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status System, as well as the Lee-Schonberg prognostic index. The main outcome measures were perioperative laboratory values, intraoperative surgical parameters and immediately postoperative complications. RESULTS: 153 consecutive women ≥ 60 years with all stages of EC, who received primary elective surgery at the University Medical Center Mainz between 2008 and 2019 were classified with selected global health assessment tools according to their preoperative performance status. In contrast to conventional prognostic parameters like older age and higher BMI, increasing frailty was significantly associated with preoperative anemia and perioperative transfusions (p < 0.05). Moreover, in patients preoperatively classified as frail significantly more postoperative complications (G8 Score: frail: 20.7% vs. non-frail: 6.7%, p = 0.028; ECOG: frail: 40.9% vs. non-frail: 2.8%, p = 0.002; and CCI: frail: 25.0% vs. non-frail: 7.4%, p = 0.003) and an increased length of hospitalization were recorded. According to propensity score matching, the risk for developing postoperative complications for frail patients was approximately two-fold higher, depending on which global health assessment tool was used. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperatively assessed frailty significantly predicts post-surgical morbidity rates in contrast to conventionally used single prognostic parameters such as age or BMI.

To standardize the preoperative frailty assessment and identify patients at risk of adverse surgical outcomes, commonly used global health assessment tools were evaluated. We aimed to assess three interdisciplinary preoperative screening assessments to investigate the influence of frailty status with in-hospital complications irrespective of surgical complexity and radicality in older women with ovarian cancer (OC). METHODS: Preoperative frailty status was examined by the G8 geriatric screening tool (G8 Score-geriatric screening), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS-oncological screening), and American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status System (ASA PS-anesthesiologic screening). The main outcome measures were the relationship between perioperative laboratory results, intraoperative surgical parameters and the incidence of immediate postoperative in-hospital complications with the preoperative frailty status. RESULTS: 116 consecutive women 60 years and older (BMI 24.8 ± 5.2 kg/m(2)) with OC, who underwent elective oncological surgery in University Medical Center Mainz between 2008 and 2019 were preoperatively classified with the selected global health assessment tools as frail or non-frail. The rate of preoperative anemia (hemoglobin ≤ 12 g/dl) and perioperative transfusions were significantly higher in the G8-frail group (65.9% vs. 34.1%; p = 0.006 and 62.7% vs. 41.8%, p = 0.031; respectively). In addition, patients preoperatively classified as G8-frail exhibited significantly more postoperative clinical in-hospital complications (27.8% vs. 12.5%, p = 0.045) independent of chronological age and BMI. In contrast, ECOG PS and ASA PS did not predict the rates of postoperative complications (all p values > 0.05). After propensity score matching, the complication rate in the G8-frail cohort was approximately 1.7 times more common than in the G8-non-frail cohort. CONCLUSION: Preoperative frailty assessment with the G8 Score identified elderly women with OC recording a significantly higher rate of postoperative in-hospital complications. In G8-frail patients, preoperative anemia and perioperative transfusions were significantly more recorded, regardless of chronological age, abnormal BMI and surgical complexity. Standardized preoperative frailty assessment should be added to clinical routine care to enhance risk stratification in older cancer individuals for surgical patient-centered decision-making.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16841,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Benzodiazepines are a reported risk factor for delirium; however, there are no studies investigating remimazolam, a novel anesthetic agent. Therefore, we prospectively investigated the effect of remimazolam on postoperative delirium. Methods: We included elective cardiovascular surgery patients aged ≥ 65 years at Hamamatsu University Hospital between August 2020 and February 2022. Patients who received general anesthesia with remimazolam were compared with those who received other anesthetics (control group). The primary outcome was delirium within 5 days after surgery. Secondary outcomes were delirium during intensive care unit stay and hospitalization, total duration of delirium, subsyndromal delirium, and differences in the Mini-Mental State Examination scores from preoperative to postoperative days 2 and 5. To adjust for differences in the groups’ baseline covariates, we used stabilized inverse probability weighting as the primary analysis and propensity score matching as the sensitivity analysis. Results: We enrolled 200 patients; 78 in the remimazolam group and 122 in the control group. After stabilized inverse probability weighting, 30.3% of the remimazolam group patients and 26.6% of the control group patients developed delirium within 5 days (risk difference, 3.8%; 95% confidence interval −11.5% to 19.1%; p = 0.63).

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the association between preoperative cognitive impairment and dementia and postoperative outcomes in older surgical patients after cardiac surgery. METHODS: Eight electronic databases were searched from inception to January 4, 2022. Inclusion criteria were cardiac surgery patients ≥60 years of age; preoperative cognitive impairment; ≥1 postoperative complication reported; comparator group with no preoperative cognitive impairment; and written in English. Using a random-effects model, we calculated effect sizes as odds ratio (OR) and standardized mean differences (SMDs). Risk of random error was assessed by applying trial sequential analysis. RESULTS: Sixteen studies (62,179 patients) were included. Preoperative cognitive impairment was associated with increased risk of delirium in older patients after cardiac surgery (70.0% vs 20.5%; OR, 8.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.25-16.38; I 2 , 0%; P < .00001). Cognitive impairment was associated with increased hospital length of stay (LOS; SMD, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.20-0.51; I 2 , 22%; P < .00001) and intensive care unit (ICU) LOS (SMD, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.09-0.68; I 2 , 70%; P = .01).

The objective of this study was to determine whether a digital cognitive assessment and patient characteristics could identify those at-risk. METHODS: Patients 65 years and older undergoing spine surgeries ≥3 h were evaluated as part of a single-center prospective observational cohort study at an academic medical center, from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2020. Of 220 eligible patients, 161 were enrolled and 152 completed the study. The primary outcome of postoperative delirium was measured by the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit or the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale, administered by trained nursing staff independent from the study protocol. Baseline cognitive impairment was identified using the tablet-based TabCAT Brain Health Assessment. RESULTS: Of the 152 patients included in this study, 46% were women. The mean [SD] age was 72 [5.4] years. Baseline cognitive impairment was identified in 38% of participants, and 26% had postoperative delirium. In multivariable analysis, impaired Brain Health Assessment Cognitive Score (OR 2.45; 95% CI, 1.05-5.67; p = 0.037), depression (OR 4.54; 95% CI, 1.73-11.89; p = 0.002), and higher surgical complexity Tier 4 (OR 5.88; 95% CI, 1.55-22.26; p = 0.009) were associated with postoperative delirium. The multivariate model was 72% accurate for predicting postoperative delirium, compared to 45% for the electronic medical record-based risk stratification model currently in use. CONCLUSION: In this prospective cohort study of spine surgery patients, age, cognitive impairment, depression, and surgical complexity identified patients at high risk for postoperative delirium. Integration of scalable digital assessments into preoperative workflows could identify high-risk patients, automate decision support for timely interventions that can improve patient outcomes and lower hospital costs, and provide a baseline cognitive assessment to monitor for postoperative cognitive change.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 17021,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Result: There was no difference in alpha or beta diversity between Control group and POCD group. There were significant differences in 39 ASV and 20 genera bacterium in the relative abundance. Significant diagnostic efficiency analyzed by the ROC curves were found in 6 genera bacterium. Differential metabolites in the two groups including acetic acid, arachidic acid, pyrophosphate etc. were screened out and enriched to certain metabolic pathways which impacted the cognition function profoundly.

The association of frailty with postoperative morbidity in elective-lobectomy patients is understudied. We examined frailty as defined by abbreviated modified frailty index (mFI-5), mFI-11 in the thoracic surgery population, and the correlation between frailty and postoperative complications. METHODS: We studied outcomes of patients in two cohorts, 2010-2012 and 2013-2019, from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database and used multivariable logistic regression models to predict all postoperative morbidity, mortality, and major morbidity. The mFI-5 could be calculated for all subjects (both 2010-2012, and 2013-2019); the mFI-11 could only be calculated for the 2010-2012 cohort. Patient frailty was defined as mFI≥3 (with either index). We used odds ratios (ORs) to examine associations of preoperative characteristics with postoperative complications and C-statistics to assess overall predictive power. RESULTS: Complications were less prevalent in the 2013-2019 cohort (17.9% versus 19.5%, P = 0.008). Open lobectomies were more common in the 2010-2012 cohort (53.9% versus 34.6%) and were strongly associated with postoperative morbidity and mortality (ORs >1.5) in both cohorts. Each frailty measure was associated with morbidity and mortality (ORs >1.4) after adjusting for other significant preoperative factors. Models on the 2010-2012 cohort had nearly identical C-statistics using the mFI-11 versus mFI-5 frailty indices (0.6142 versus 0.6139; P > 0.8). CONCLUSIONS: Frailty, as captured in the mFI-5, is a significant associated factor of postoperative morbidity and mortality following elective lobectomies.

RECENT FINDINGS: Frailty results from an accelerated loss of functional reserve associated with ageing and leads to increased vulnerability following surgery. It is a complex and multidimensional syndrome involving physiological and psychosocial systems. Frailty is a separate entity from comorbidities and disabilities. Frailty is associated with an increased risk of complications and a higher mortality rate after thoracic surgery. Patients can easily be screened for frailty and frail patients can benefit from further assessment of all areas of frailty secondarily. Prehabilitation and rehabilitation can help limit frailty-related complications after thoracic surgery. SUMMARY: Frailty should be part of the routine preoperative evaluation for thoracic surgery.

L.",Geriatric assessment and treatment decision-making in surgical oncology,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Present an approach for surgical decision-making in cancer that incorporates geriatric assessment by building upon the common categories of tumor, technical, and patient factors to enable dual assessment of disease and geriatric factors. RECENT FINDINGS: Conventional preoperative assessment is insufficient for older adults missing important modifiable deficits, and inaccurately estimating treatment intolerance, complications, functional impairment and disability, and death. Including geriatric-focused assessment into routine perioperative care facilitates improved communications between clinicians and patients and among interdisciplinary teams. In addition, it facilitates the detection of geriatric-specific deficits that are amenable to treatment. We propose a framework for embedding geriatric assessment into surgical oncology practice to allow more accurate risk stratification, identify and manage geriatric deficits, support decision-making, and plan proactively for both cancer-directed and non-cancer-directed therapies. This patient-centered approach can reduce adverse outcomes such as functional decline, delirium, prolonged hospitalization, discharge to long-term care, immediate postoperative complications, and death.

The incidence is 19% in neurological procedures, and advanced age is a risk factor for neurological procedures. Many studies have shown that dexmedetomidine (DEX) reduced the incidence of delirium after non-cardiac surgery in elderly patients. However, there are few studies focus on the effect of DEX on POD in elderly patients undergoing neurosurgery. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a randomised, double-blinded, paralleled-group and controlled trial. Patients older than 65 years and scheduled for elective craniotomy will be randomly assigned to the DEX group and the control group. After endotracheal intubation, patients in the DEX group will be administered with continuous DEX infusion at rate of 0.4 µg/kg/hour until the surgical haemostasis. In the control group, patients will receive the identical volume of normal saline in the same setting. The primary outcome is the incidence of POD during the first 5 days. Delirium will be evaluated through a combination of three methods, including the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS), the confusion assessment method for ICU (CAM-ICU) and the 3 min diagnostic interview for CAM (3D-CAM). The RASS, CAM-ICU and 3D-CAM will be evaluated two times per day (08:00-10:00 and 18:00-20:00 hours) during the first postoperative 5 days. Secondary outcomes include pain severity score, quality of recovery, quality of sleep, cognitive function, psychological health state, intraoperative data, physiological status, length of stay in ICU and hospital, hospitalisation costs, non-delirium complications, and 30-day all-cause mortality. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol (V.4.0) has been approved by the medical ethics committee of Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University (KY2021-194-03).

METHODS: A literature search of the PubMed, Ovid Medline, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases was performed in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Articles were screened for clinical studies published from 2017 to 2022 with greater than 100 patients and minimum 2-year follow-up. Exclusion criteria included failure to report postoperative patient-reported outcomes (PROs), no preoperative radiographic measurements, and surgery for pathology other than FAIS. Data collection included study characteristics, patient demographics, radiographic findings, intraoperative findings, procedures performed, postoperative PROs, and subsequent surgeries. RESULTS: Nine studies met inclusion criteria. Mean or median patient ages ranged from 32.3 to 41 years, with 4 studies reporting on greater than 50% female patients. Mean preoperative lateral center edge angles and alpha angles ranged from 30.2° to 37° and from 56.2° to 71°, respectively. Labral repairs (range 69.7%-100%) were performed more commonly than debridements (range 0%-26.3%). All studies demonstrated improved PROs at most recent follow-up. Seven studies reported mean or median modified Harris Hip Scores, with preoperative and postoperative values that ranged from 53.1 to 80 and from 67.4 to 100, respectively. Revision hip arthroscopies and conversions to hip arthroplasty ranged from 0.8% to 11.6% and from 0% to 34%, respectively.

R. B., Christopher, Z. K., Spangehl, M. J., Clarke, H. D., Bingham, J. S.",There are Considerable Inconsistencies Among Minimum Clinically Important Differences in TKA: A Systematic Review,"BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are frequently used to assess the impact of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) on patients. However, mere statistical comparison of PROMs is not sufficient to assess the value of TKA to the patient, especially given the risk profile of arthroplasty. Evaluation of treatment effect sizes is important to support the use of an intervention; this is often quantified with the minimum clinically important difference (MCID). MCIDs are unique to specific PROMs, as they vary by calculation methodology and study population. Therefore, a systematic review of calculated MCID values, their respective ranges, and assessment of their applications is important to guide and encourage their use as a critical measure of effect size in TKA outcomes research. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: In this systematic review of MCID calculations and reporting in primary TKA, we asked: (1) What are the most frequently reported PROM MCIDs and their reported ranges in TKA? (2) What proportion of studies report distribution- versus anchor-based MCID values? (3) What are the most common methods by which these MCID values are derived for anchor-based values? (4) What are the most common derivation methods for distribution-based values? (5) How do the reported medians and corresponding interquartile ranges (IQR) compare between calculation methods for each PROM? METHODS: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, a systematic review was conducted using the PubMed, EMBASE, and MEDLINE databases from inception through March 2022 for TKA articles reporting an MCID value for any PROMs. Two independent reviewers screened articles for eligibility, including any article that calculated new MCID values for PROMs after primary TKA, and extracted these data for analysis. Overall, 576 articles were identified, 38 of which were included in the final analysis. These studies had a total of 710,128 patients with a median age of 67.7 years and median BMI of 30.9 kg/m 2 . Women made up more than 50% of patients in most studies, and the median follow-up period was 17 months (range 0.25 to 72 months). The overall risk of bias was assessed as moderate using the Jadad criteria for one randomized controlled trial (3 of 5 ideal global score) and the modified Methodological Index for Non-randomized Studies criteria for comparative studies (mean 17.2 ± 1.8) and noncomparative studies (mean 9.6 ± 1.3). There were 49 unique PROMs for which 233 MCIDs were reported. Calculated values were classified as anchor-based, distribution-based, or not reported. MCID values for each PROM, MCID calculation method, number of patients, and study demographics were extracted from each study. Anchor-based and distribution-based MCIDs were compared for each unique PROM using a Wilcoxon rank sum test given non-normal distribution of values. RESULTS: The WOMAC Function and Pain subscores were the most frequently reported MCID value, comprising 9% (22 of 233) and 9% (22 of 233), respectively. The composite Oxford Knee Score (OKS) was the next most frequently reported (9% [21 of 233]), followed by the WOMAC composite score (6% [13 of 233]). The median anchor-based values for WOMAC Function and Pain subscores were 23 (IQR 16 to 33) and 25 (IQR 14 to 31), while the median distribution-based values were 11 (IQR 10.8 to 11) and 22 (IQR 17 to 23), respectively. The median anchor-based MCID value for the OKS was 6 (IQR 4 to 7), while the distribution-based value was 7 (IQR 5 to 10). Thirty-nine percent (15 of 38) used an anchor-based method to calculate a new MCID, while 32% (12 of 38) used a distribution-based technique. Twenty-nine percent of studies (11 of 38) calculated MCID values using both methods. For studies reporting an anchor-based calculation method, a question assessing patient satisfaction, pain relief, or quality of life along a five-point Likert scale was the most commonly used anchor (40% [16 of 40]), followed by a receiver operating characteristic curve estimation (25% [10 of 40]). For studies using distribution-based calculations, all articles used a measure of study population variance in their derivation of the MCID, with the most common method reported as one-half the standard deviation of the difference between preoperative and postoperative PROM scores (45% [14 of 31]). Most reported median MCID values (15 of 19) did not differ by calculation method for each unique PROM (p > 0.05) apart from the WOMAC Function component score and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Pain and Activities of Daily Living subscores. CONCLUSION: Despite variability of MCIDs for each PROM, there is consistency in the methodology by which MCID values have been derived in published studies. Additionally, there is a consensus about MCID values regardless of calculation method across most of the PROMs we evaluated. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Given their importance to treatment selection and patient safety, authors and journals should report MCID values with greater consistency. We recommend using a 7-point increase as the MCID for the OKS, consistent with the median reported anchor-based value derived from several high-quality studies with large patient groups that used anchor-based approaches for MCID calculation, which we believe are most appropriate for most applications in clinical research. Likewise, we recommend using a 10-point to 15-point increase for the MCID of composite WOMAC, as the median value was 12 (IQR 10 to 17) with no difference between calculation methods. We recommend use of median reported values for WOMAC function and pain subscores: 21 (IQR 15 to 33) and 23 (IQR 13 to 29), respectively.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 17053,Search update 2023-11-13,,

METHODS: Patients aged 60 to 80 years who underwent the surgery of thoracoscopic lobectomy were selected; ASA grades I to III and New York Heart Association (NYHA) grades I to II. Patients were randomly divided into two groups: group C (group Compaired) and group T (group Thoracic Paravertebral Nerve Block TPVB). Patients in group T received ultrason-guided TPVB while those in group C didn't received TPVB. Postoperative patient-controlled intravenous analgesia was administered to all the patients. The consumption of intraoperative opioids, cases of hipoxemia, operative time, and extubation time was also recorded. Pain scores (static and dynamic) were assessed at 2, 4, 6, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours point after the operation. Pain scores, occurrence of postoperative delirium occurrence, postoperative complications, total amount of analgesic drugs, length of hospital stay, rescue analgesic requirement, and side effects were recorded within 5 days. RESULTS: Intraoperative dosages of sufentanil and remifentanil were significantly lower in group T (Table 1). The postoperative recovery time in group T was significantly shortened (Table 1). The VAS pain scores of group T at 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours after surgery were much lower. The consumption of intraoperative opioids, number of rescue analgesic requirements, and the occurrence of postoperative delirium incidence in group T was significantly reduced (Table 2). There were no differences in hipoxemia events, postoperative nausea, vomiting and pulmonary complications between the two groups (Table 2). CONCLUSION: Preoperative ultrasound-guided thoracic paravertebral nerve block (TPVB) can obviously decrease the intraoperative and postoperative opioids consumption, shorten the recovery time, reduce the number of rescue analgesia and the incidence of postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing thoracoscopic lobotomy.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 17008,Search update 2023-11-13,,

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records of old and frail patients surgical treated at a single neurosurgical institution between January 2018 to May 2021. Inclusion criteria were: (1) neuropathological diagnosis of glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype; (2) patient≥65years at the time of surgery; (3) available data to assess the frailty index according to the 5-modified Frailty Index (5-mFI). RESULTS: A total of 47 patients were included. The 5-mFI was at 0 in 11 cases (23.4%), at 1 in 30 cases (63.8%), at 2 in two cases (4.2%), at 3 in two cases (4.2%), and at 4 in two cases (4.2%). A gross total resection was performed in 26 patients (55.3%), a subtotal resection was performed in 13 patients (27.6%), and a biopsy was performed in 8 patients (17.1%). The rate of 30-day postoperative complications was higher in the biopsy subgroup and in the 5-mFI=4 subgroup. Gross total resection and age≤70years were independent predictors of a longer overall survival. Sex, 5-mFI, postoperative complications, and preoperative Karnofsky Performance Status score did not influence overall survival and functional dependency. CONCLUSION: In patients≥65years harboring a glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype, gross total resection remains an independent predictor of longer survival and good postoperative functional recovery.

S., Maze, M.",Contribution of intraoperative electroencephalogram suppression to frailty-associated postoperative delirium: mediation analysis of a prospective surgical cohort,"BACKGROUND: Frailty is a risk factor for postoperative delirium (POD), and has led to preoperative interventions that have reduced, but not eliminated, the risk. We hypothesised that EEG suppression, another risk factor for POD, mediates some of the frailty risk for POD. METHODS: A prospective cohort study enrolled patients aged 65 yr or older, scheduled for noncardiac surgery under total intravenous anaesthesia. Frailty was assessed using the FRAIL scale. Cumulative duration of EEG suppression, defined as an amplitude between -5 and 5 μV for >0.5 s during anaesthesia, was measured. POD was diagnosed by either confusion assessment method (CAM), CAM-ICU, or medical records. The severity of POD was assessed using the Delirium Rating Scale - Revised-98 (DRS). Mediation analysis was used to estimate the relationships between frailty, EEG suppression, and severity of POD. RESULTS: Among 252 enrolled patients, 51 were robust, 129 were prefrail, and 72 were frail. Patients classified as frail had higher duration of EEG suppression than either the robust (19 vs 0.57 s, P<0.001) or prefrail groups (19 vs 3.22 s, P<0.001). Peak delirium score was higher in the frail group than either the robust (17 vs 15, P<0.001) or prefrail groups (17 vs 16, P=0.007). EEG suppression time mediated 24.2% of the frailty-DRS scores association. CONCLUSION: EEG suppression time mediated a statistically significant portion of the frailty-POD association in older noncardiac surgery patients. Trials directed at reducing EEG suppression time could result in intraoperative interventions to reduce POD in frail patients.

Here we compared R0 resection rate and degradation of autonomy based on the instrumental activities of daily living score between neoadjuvant, short course radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy in this specific population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients ≥75 years with resectable T3-T4 rectal adenocarcinoma within 12 cm of the anal verge or T2 of the very low rectum were randomised between short course radiotherapy (5 × 5 Gy in one week) and chemoradiotherapy (50 Gy, 2 Gy/f, 5 weeks with capecitabine: 800 mg/m(2) twice daily, 5 days per week), with delayed surgery 7 ± 1 weeks for the two arms. RESULTS: One hundred and three eligible patients were enrolled between January 2016 and December 2019 when the trial was closed due to poor accrual. The R0 resection rate (first co-primary objective) was 84.3%; confidence interval 95% [73.26-94.18] in the short course group and 88%; confidence interval 95% [77.77-96.60] in the chemoradiotherapy group (non-inferiority p = 0.28). The deterioration of the instrumental activities of daily living score was not different during the pre-operative phase, it was significantly more deteriorated in the chemoradiotherapy group at 3 months post-operative (44.8% versus 14.8%; p = 0.032) but was not different at 12 months post-operative (second co-primary objective). During pre-operative phase, 9.8% of patients in short course group and 22% of patients in chemoradiotherapy group presented a serious adverse event, but we observed no difference during the post-operative phase between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Although the main objectives of the study were not achieved, the short course radiotherapy followed by delayed surgery could represent a preferred treatment option in patients ≥75 years with locally advanced rectal cancer; a new study must be performed to confirm the improvement in overall and specific survival results.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 17042,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Negative consequences associated with POP included prolonged hospital length of stay, more frequent intensive care unit (ICU) stays, and a higher rate of sepsis, readmission, and mortality. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the incidence and risk factors associated with POP after hip fracture surgery in elderly patients. PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched (up to March 31, 2022). All studies on the risk factors for POP after hip fracture surgery in elderly patients, published in English, were reviewed. The qualities of the included studies were assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data were pooled, and a meta-analysis was performed.

METHODS: The MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched for studies published prior to 2020 on ketamine in THA and TKA. All included studies underwent qualitative assessment and quantitative homogeneity testing followed by a systematic review and direct comparison meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of ketamine. After a critical appraisal of 136 publications, 7 high-quality studies were included for analyses. RESULTS: High-quality evidence demonstrates that intraoperative ketamine decreases postoperative opioid consumption. Four of 7 studies found that ketamine reduces postoperative pain. Intraoperative ketamine is not associated with an increase in adverse events and may reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting (relative risk [RR] 0.68; 95% CI 0.50-0.92). CONCLUSION: High-quality evidence supports the use of ketamine intraoperatively in THA and TKA to reduce postoperative opioid consumption. Most studies found ketamine reduces postoperative pain, nausea, and vomiting. Moderate quality evidence supports the safety of ketamine, but it should be used cautiously in patients at risk for postoperative delirium, such as the elderly.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16909,Search update 2023-11-13,,

First, by evaluating if CI performance was maintained over an extended follow-up period regardless of preoperative cognitive status. Secondly, by evaluating if there was a difference in the rate of cognitive decline between preoperative mild and normal cognition following CI over an extended period of time. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: CI recipients ≥65 years of age implanted between 2009 and 2014 with 4+ years follow up. Pre- and postoperative audiometric and speech outcome assessments were collected. Cognitive status was measured using the mini mental status examination (MMSE) at numerous time points. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients met inclusion. Patients were divided into two groups based on preoperative MMSE with scores considered normal (28-30) and those with mildly impaired cognition (MIC, scores 25-27). Audiometric and speech performance improved significantly at one-year post implantation and this was maintained without significant change at 4+ years, regardless of cognitive status. Mixed modeling analysis controlling for age demonstrated no significant difference in the rate of cognitive decline at 4+ years post implantation between the normal cognition cohort (1.74; 95%CI 0.89-2.6) and MIC (2.9; 95%1.91-3.88). CONCLUSION: Speech performance was significantly improved and sustained after CI in both normal cognition and MIC patients. The rate of cognitive decline in older adult CI patients appears to be similar regardless of preoperative cognitive status. Although results demonstrate rates of cognitive decline following CI did not differ between cognition groups over 4+ years, future studies will need to further investigate this over extended time periods with a more comprehensive cognitive testing battery.

STUDY DESIGN: This cohort study used NSQIP (2013-2019) data with electronic health record and cost data risk-adjusted for frailty, preoperative acute serious conditions (PASC), case status, and operative stress assessing cumulative costs of failure to achieve textbook outcomes defined as absence of 30-day Clavien-Dindo level III and IV complications, emergency department visits/observation stays (EDOS), and readmissions across insurance types (private, Medicare, Medicaid, uninsured). Return costs were defined as costs of all 30-day emergency department visits/observation stays and readmissions. RESULTS: Cases were performed on patients (private 1,506; Medicare 1,218; Medicaid 1,420; uninsured 2,178) with a mean age 52.3 years (SD 14.7) and 47.5% male. Medicaid and uninsured patients had higher odds of presenting with preoperative acute serious conditions (adjusted odds ratios 1.89 and 1.81, respectively) and undergoing urgent/emergent surgeries (adjusted odds ratios 2.23 and 3.02, respectively) vs private. Medicaid and uninsured patients had lower odds of textbook outcomes (adjusted odds ratios 0.53 and 0.78, respectively) and higher odds of emergency department visits/observation stays and readmissions vs private. Not achieving textbook outcomes was associated with a greater than 95.1% increase in cumulative costs. Medicaid patients had a relative increase of 23.1% in cumulative costs vs private, which was 18.2% after adjusting for urgent/emergent cases. Return costs were 37.5% and 65.8% higher for Medicaid and uninsured patients, respectively, vs private. CONCUSIONS: Higher costs for Medicaid patients were partially driven by increased presentation acuity (increased rates/odds of preoperative acute serious conditions and urgent/emergent surgeries) and higher rates of multiple emergency department visits/observation stays and readmission occurrences.

Thus, this study aimed to analyze the neurocognitive status of patients scheduled for CABG surgery with the use of an advanced computerized cognitive battery (CNS Vital Signs) and to investigate possible associations between impaired performance in selective cognitive areas and the risk of postoperative delirium development. METHODS: The study enrolled 127 participants with a median age of 67 years (IQR: 63-71). Postoperative delirium developed in 32 (25%) patients.Before surgery, the patients were screened for global cognitive impairment with the use of the Mini-Mental State Examination Test, and the individuals were asked to perform the CNS Vital Signs battery to investigate 12 specific cognitive domains. The Confusion Assessment Method and the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale were used to screen for a diagnosis of delirium postoperatively. RESULTS: In multivariate models, a lower score of verbal memory-assessed preoperatively was independently associated with the risk of postoperative delirium development. Other independent predictors of delirium included more advanced age, gender female, depression, postoperative pyrexia, and the presence of extracorporeal circulation. CONCLUSIONS: As decreased verbal memory constitutes an independent risk factor for postoperative delirium, a verbal memory test may be a useful predictor of postoperative delirium development.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 17045,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Since postoperative delirium is associated with poor outcomes and the treatment is very complicated, identifying the patients at high risk for delirium and providing more attentive care to prevent postoperative delirium is essential. In this study, we aimed to assess the association of an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP)/albumin ratio with the increased incidence of postoperative delirium in elderly people who had undergone hip fracture surgery.

Patients were classified into two groups according to preoperative CRP/albumin cut-off levels (<1.5 and ≥1.5). We performed a propensity score matching analysis to compare the incidence of postoperative delirium and overall mortality between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression and Cox regression analyses were performed to examine the association of the preoperative CRP/albumin ratio with postoperative delirium and overall mortality. RESULTS: There were significant differences in the incidence of postoperative delirium (18.0 % vs. 35.8 %, P < 0.001) and overall mortality (26.7 % vs. 46.9 %, P < 0.001) between the groups before matching. We also observed significant differences in the incidence of postoperative delirium (20.7 % vs. 32.7 %, P = 0.019) and overall mortality (34.7 % vs. 46.0 %, P = 0.046) between the groups after matching. A high CRP/albumin ratio (≥1.5) was significantly associated with a higher incidence of postoperative delirium (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 2.11, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1.40-3.18, P < 0.001) and a higher rate of overall mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 1.44, 95 % CI: 1.07-1.93, P = 0.015). CONCLUSION: Preoperative CRP/albumin ratio might be an independent risk factor of postoperative delirium and surgical prognosis in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgery.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 17012,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Methods: Patients aged _65 years who were scheduled to undergo elective spine surgery from February 2018 to May 2019 were prospectively recruited for this study. Delirium was diagnosed according to the Confusion Assessment Method algorithm. Candidate predictors included patient characteristics, comorbidities, surgical time, blood loss, preoperative laboratory parameters, and preoperative cognitive function, as assessed by the Mini-Cog test. These variables were compared between patients with and without POD. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify the independent predictors of POD. For the continuous variables, a receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine the optimal cutoff value for predicting POD. Results: Of the 106 patients included in the study, 12 (11.3%) patients developed POD, with a median time to onset of 3 d and median duration of 2 d. After adjusting for confounders, the occurrence of POD was independently associated with older age, a higher blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentration, and a lower Mini-Cog score. The optimal cutoff point of the Mini-Cog score for predicting the occurrence of POD was ≤3. Conclusions: POD was a common complication after spine surgery, showing an incidence of 11.3% in this study. Older age, a higher BUN concentration, and impaired cognition, as defined by the Mini-Cog, were independent predictors of POD. The current results may be useful for early identification of patients at risk of POD and facilitation of targeted interventions for preventing POD or mitigating its severity.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16942,Search update 2023-11-13,,

This study investigated the association between frailty and late outcomes among patients who underwent thoracic aortic surgery via median sternotomy. METHODS: A total of 1010 patients underwent thoracic aortic surgery via median sternotomy between April 2008 and December 2016. Patients < 65 years of age, those who underwent urgent or emergent surgery, and those with incomplete data were excluded; as such, 374 patients were ultimately included in the present study. Frailty was evaluated using an index comprising history of dementia, body mass index < 18.5 kg/m(2), and hypoalbuminemia. A frailty score from 0 to 3 was determined by assigning 1 point for each criterion met. Frailty was defined as a score ≥ 1. Patients were categorized into of 2 groups: frail (n = 52) and non-frail (n = 322). The mean follow-up was 6.1 ± 3.1 years. RESULTS: Overall in-hospital mortality did not differ between the frail and non-frail groups. However, the incidence of re-exploration for bleeding and discharge to a health care facility was higher in the frail group than in the non-frail group. Multivariable analysis revealed that preoperative frailty was an independent predictor of late mortality during follow-up [hazard ratio 3.71 (95% confidence interval 2.16-6.37); P < 0.001]. CONCLUSION: Preoperative frailty was associated with late mortality after thoracic aortic surgery. Assessment of preoperative frailty using a simple frailty index may be useful in the decision-making process for elderly patients.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16884,Search update 2023-11-13,,

M., Röhr, V.",Desflurane is risk factor for postoperative delirium in older patients’ independent from intraoperative burst suppression duration,"Background: Postoperative Delirium (POD) is the most frequent neurocognitive complication after general anesthesia in older patients. The development of POD is associated with prolonged periods of burst suppression activity in the intraoperative electroencephalogram (EEG). The risk to present burst suppression activity depends not only on the age of the patient but is also more frequent during propofol anesthesia as compared to inhalative anesthesia. The aim of our study is to determine, if the risk to develop POD differs depending on the anesthetic agent given and if this correlates with a longer duration of intraoperative burst suppression. Methods: In this secondary analysis of the SuDoCo trail [ISRCTN 36437985] 1277 patients, older than 60 years undergoing general anesthesia were included. We preprocessed and analyzed the raw EEG files from each patient and evaluated the intraoperative burst suppression duration. In a logistic regression analysis, we assessed the impact of burst suppression duration and anesthetic agent used for maintenance on the risk to develop POD. Results: 18.7% of patients developed POD. Burst suppression duration was prolonged in POD patients (POD 27.5 min ± 21.3 min vs. NoPOD 21.4 ± 16.2 min, p < 0.001), for each minute of prolonged intraoperative burst suppression activity the risk to develop POD increased by 1.1% (OR 1.011, CI 95% 1.000–1.022, p = 0.046). Burst suppression duration was prolonged under propofol anesthesia as compared to sevoflurane and desflurane anesthesia (propofol 32.5 ± 20.3 min, sevoflurane 17.1 ± 12.6 min and desflurane 20.1 ± 16.0 min, p < 0.001). However, patients receiving desflurane anesthesia had a 1.8fold higher risk to develop POD, as compared to propofol anesthesia (OR 1.766, CI 95% 1.049–2.974, p = 0.032). Conclusion: We found a significantly increased risk to develop POD after desflurane anesthesia in older patients, even though burst suppression duration was shorter under desflurane anesthesia as compared to propofol anesthesia. Our finding might help to explain some discrepancies in studies analyzing the impact of burst suppression duration and EEG-guided anesthesia on the risk to develop POD.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16961,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Background: Although current guidelines recommend that immunonutrition should be prescribed for malnourished patients before major gastrointestinal surgery, the benefit of preoperative immunonutrition remains debatable. Methods: Between April 2019 and October 2020, 176 patients with primary colon cancer were enrolled and randomly assigned (1:1) to receive preoperative immunonutrition plus a normal diet (n = 88) or a normal diet alone (n = 88). Patients in the immunonutrition group received oral nutritional supplementation (400 mL/d) with arginine and ω-3 fatty acids for 7 days before elective surgery. The primary endpoint was the rate of infectious complications, and the secondary endpoints were the postoperative complication rate, change in body weight, and length of hospital stay. Results: The rates of infectious (17.7% vs 15.9%, P = 0.751) and total (31.6% vs 29.3%, P = 0.743) complications were not different between the two groups. Old age was the only significant predictive factor for the occurrence of infectious complications (odds ratio = 2.990, 95% confidence interval 1.179-7.586, P = 0.021). The length of hospital stay (7.6 ± 2.5 vs 7.4 ± 2.3 days, P = 0.635) and overall change in body weight (P = 0.379) were similar between the two groups. However, only the immunonutrition group showed weight recovery after discharge (+0.4 ± 2.1 vs -0.7 ± 2.3 kg, P = 0.002).

We used prophylactic inhalation of hydrogen gas in elderly patients undergoing elective surgery to compare their occurrence of postoperative delirium with that of controls. Methods: A total of 184 patients aged ≥ 65 years were enrolled and randomized into either a control group or a hydrogen inhalation group. The quality of sleep was assessed 1 day before and 1, 3, and 7 days after surgery at 8 A.M. The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) was used as a screening tool for delirium and assessed the patients’ state of consciousness 1–7 days after surgery. Results: Postoperative delirium occurred in 17 (24%) of 70 patients without hydrogen inhalation and in 10 (12%) of 83 patients after hydrogen inhalation. The incidence of delirium was decreased in the hydrogen group. No significant differences were found between length of stay in hospital after surgery and sleep quality at 1, 3, and 7 days postoperatively between the two groups. The numerical rating scale (NRS) pain scores were higher in the hydrogen group (4.08 ± 1.77) than the control group (3.54 ± 1.77) on day 1 (p < 0.05); however, the mean difference between the two groups was small (1 to 1.6). There were no significant differences on day 3 and 7. The postoperative C-reactive protein level was significantly lower in the hydrogen group than the control group.

Design: Observational, prospective, single-center study. Settings: Operating room. Patients: 107 adult (<65 years) and elderly (≥65 years) women undergoing breast surgery. Interventions: Propofol-remifentanil TIVA-TCI-guided by SE for depth of anesthesia monitoring (target value 40–60) and SPI for antinociception monitoring (target value 20–50) without neuromuscular blockade. Measurements: Age; body mass index; American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification; concentration at the effect site of propofol (CeP) and remifentanil (CeR) at loss of responsiveness (LoR), median during anesthesia maintenance (MdM), and at return of responsiveness (RoR); propofol infusion duration; incidence of postoperative delirium (POD) with Confusing Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit. Main results: During SE-SPI-guided TIVA-TCI, 13.1% of patients showed unwanted spontaneous responsiveness, whereas 45.8% showed BSupp. Unwanted spontaneous responsiveness was observed mainly in adults (p < 0.05), and higher CeP RoR (p < 0.05) was registered. BSupp was observed mainly in patients showing a lower CeP MdM (p < 0.01) and CeP RoR (p < 0.05). Unwanted spontaneous responsiveness and BSupp were not associated with significant differences in CeRs. An age-related hysteresis effect was observed, resulting in higher CeP LoR than CeP RoR (p < 0.001). 12.2% of patients showed POD. Only preoperative serum albumin was associated with increased likelihood of POD (p = 0.046). Conclusions: The SE-SPI-guided TIVA-TCI did not prevent unwanted spontaneous responsiveness and BSupp. CeP RoR may be used as a proxy for anesthetic sensitivity.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 17043,Search update 2023-11-13,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the perioperative data of 195 patients aged 65 or older who underwent elective urinary calculi surgery between September 2020 and September 2022. POD was defined by chart-based method, and the serum uric acid to creatinine (SUA/Cr) ratio as well as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were calculated, respectively. Identification of the risk factors for POD was performed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Moreover, the risk stratification score was developed based on the regression coefficients of the associated variables. RESULTS: In 195 eligible patients following urinary calculi surgery, the median age was 69 (66-72) and 19 patients ultimately developed POD (9.7%). The results by univariate analysis showed that patients with advanced age, high American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status (≥3) and low SUA/Cr ratio (≤3.3) were more likely to develop POD, but dexmedetomidine can significantly decrease the risk of the occurrence of POD. The multivariate analysis further indicated that high ASA physical status (≥3) and low SUA/Cr ratio (≤3.3) were independently associated with POD, and the POD incidence could obviously be elevated with the increase of risk stratification score. Moreover, patients with delirium had longer hospital stays. CONCLUSION: POD is frequent in geriatric patients following urinary calculi surgery (9.7%). The high ASA physical status (≥3) and low SUA/Cr ratio (≤3.3) were effective predictors of POD. The corresponding risk stratification based on these factors could be beneficial to determining patients who are susceptible to POD, and thus better preventing and reducing the occurrence of POD.

However, satisfactory biomarkers for predicting individual risks of POD have not been confirmed. D-ribose involvement in protein glycation and aggregation plays a pivotal role in age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine whether serum D-ribose concentrations contribute to the early diagnosis of POD. We also discuss the probable mechanisms underlying the development of POD. METHODS: 110 older patients with hip fracture who had undergone internal fixation or hip replacement under general anesthesia and had completed our assessments were selected. Preoperative venous blood (4 ml) was collected before the induction of anesthesia. Postoperative venous blood was obtained at 07:00 and 20:00 h on postoperative day 1 and at 20:00 h on postoperative day 2. On the first 2 postoperative days, the patients were assessed twice daily (at 8:00 and 20:00 h on each day) using the Confusion Assessment Method-Chinese Revision. RESULTS: 15 patients were finally diagnosed with POD. We also included 15 patients without POD who were matched with the recruited patients with POD (1:1) on the basis of age, sex, body mass index and the Mini-Mental State Examination score. Serum ribose concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The demographic characteristics of the groups were matched. Preoperative serum ribose concentrations were significantly higher in patients with POD than in those without POD (p < 0.05) and were also an independent risk factor for POD. Moreover, when the preoperative serum ribose concentration doubled, the risk of POD increased by 1.672 times. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the serum D-ribose concentration may be a potential predictive molecular biomarker for POD, and provide useful information for further pathological mechanism studies.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 17020,Search update 2023-11-13,,

The purpose of this study was to develop a machine learning model to identify preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative high-risk factors and predict the occurrence of delirium after nonbrain surgery in elderly patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 950 elderly patients were included in the study, including 132 patients with POD. We collected 30 characteristic variables, including patient demographic characteristics, basic medical history, preoperative examination characteristics, type of surgery, and intraoperative information. Three machine learning algorithms, multilayer perceptron (MLP), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and k-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN), were applied to construct the model, and the k-fold cross-validation method, ROC curve, calibration curve, decision curve analysis (DCA) and external validation were used for model evaluation. RESULTS: XGBoost showed the best performance among the three prediction models. The ROC curve results showed that XGBoost had a high area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.982 in the training set; the AUC value in the validation set was 0.924, and the prediction model was highly accurate. The k-fold cross-validation method was used for internal validation, and the XGBoost model was stable The calibration curve showed high predictive power of the XGBoost model. The DCA curve showed a higher benefit rate for patients who received interventional treatment under the XGBoost model. The AUC value for the external validation set was 0.88, indicating that the predictive model was extrapolative. CONCLUSION: The prediction model of POD derived from the machine learning algorithm in this study has high prediction accuracy and clinical utility, which is beneficial for clinicians to diagnose and treat patients in a timely manner.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 17032,Search update 2023-11-13,,

However, the timing of medical complications during the inpatient stay have not been previously described. Accurate anticipation of complications and adverse events may improve patient counseling and postoperative management. PURPOSE: (1) Describe the rate of medical complication and adverse events by postoperative day after ASD surgery and (2) determine whether early ambulation is protective for complications. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Single institution retrospective cohort study. PATIENT SAMPLE: Two hundred thirty-five patients with ASD who underwent posterior-only fusion of the lumbar spine (≥5 levels to the pelvis) between 2013 and 2020. OUTCOME MEASURES: Medical complications, categorized per the International Spine Study Group-AO system (cardiopulmonary [CP], gastrointestinal [GI], central nervous system [CNS], infectious [nonsurgical site], and renal) and adverse events (postoperative blood transfusion, urinary retention, and electrolyte abnormalities). METHODS: Patients were identified from an institutional ASD database. Outcome measures were classified by the first postoperative day the event was recognized. Demographics, year of surgery, surgical factors, radiographic parameters, surgical invasiveness (ASD-S Index), frailty (Modified Frailty Index-5 [mFI-5]), Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), smoking, preoperative opioid use, depression, and post-operative day of ambulation were assessed as risk factors for inpatient medical complications. RESULTS: After exclusions of patients with incomplete medical chart data, 191 patients were available for analysis, mean age 66±10 y, BMI 28±5 kg/m2, PI-LL 24±20°, T1PA 28±13°. Inpatient medical complications occurred in 55 (28.8%) patients; adverse events occurred in 137 (71.7%). Length of stay was higher in patients with medical complications (mean 8.5±3.8 vs. 5.8±2.3 days, p<.001). However, for patients who had an adverse event, but no medical complication, LOS was comparable (p>.05). Most medical complications occurred by POD3 (58% of all complications). Risk (defined as the proportion of patients with that complication out of all inpatients that day) of CNS, CP, and GI complication peaked early in the postoperative course (CNS on POD1 [2.1% risk]; GI on POD2 [3.7%]; CP on POD3 [2.7%]). Risk for infectious and renal complications (infectious POD8 [2.7%]; renal POD7 [0.9%]) peaked later (Figure 1). On univariate analysis, patients with medical complications had higher rates of OSA (9.1% vs. 2.2%, p=.045), ASD-S (45.9 vs. 40.8, p=.04), max coronal cobb (46.9 vs. 36.7°, p=.003), ASA class (2.5 vs. 2.3, p=.01), and POD of ambulation (1.9 vs. 1.3, p=.01). On multivariate logistic regression (c-statistic 0.78), larger coronal cobb and later POD of ambulation were independent risk factors for complications (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.07 and OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-4.7, respectively).

Journal of Thoracic Disease.  2023. 15:701-710","Lu, Y., Liu, X.",Postoperative delirium and its influencing factors in elderly patients with lung cancer in the intensive care unit,"Background: In 2020, there were 2,206,771 new cases of lung cancer worldwide, ranking first in mortality rate postoperative delirium (POD) is a common surgical complication and typically occurs 1–3 days after surgery which leads to prolonged hospital stay. The currently available research on POD in elderly patients was mainly carried out in cardiac surgery, orthopedic, and gastroenterology departments. It is necessary to study the incidence and risk factors of delirium in intensive care unit (ICU) elderly patients after lung cancer surgery. Methods: This study is a single-center and singe-arm observational study which examined the incidence of and factors affecting POD in elderly patients with lung cancer in ICU at our center from September 2019 to May 2020. 22 relevant variables including arterial oxygen partial pressure, postoperative sedative drug use, and other data were collected. The Confusion Assessment Method of Intensive Care Unit was used to assess the occurrence of POD, the Chinese version of the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire was used to assess patients’ postoperative sleep quality, and the Mini-Mental State Examination was used to assess patients’ preoperative cognitive level. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the factors affecting POD in elderly ICU patients with lung cancer. Results: Among the 208 elderly ICU patients who underwent surgery for lung cancer, 32 (15.38%) had POD. The results showed that postoperative blood oxygen level, preoperative cognitive level score and postoperative sleep quality score in delirium group were significantly lower than those in non-delirium group (P values were 0.002, 0.000, 0.000, respectively). The proportion of previous coronary heart disease and postoperative sedation use in delirium group was significantly higher than that in non-delirium group (P=0.008 and 0.008, respectively). Conclusions: It was observed that the preoperative Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score and postoperative Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ) score of the delirium group were significantly lower than those of the non-delirium group, and this trend was still observed after adjusting for influencing factors. It is suggested that the difference of cognitive level in elderly lung cancer population has a significant effect on the occurrence of POD. In clinical work, we should pay more attention to patients with preoperative cognitive impairment, hypoxic state, and postoperative sleep disturbance.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16979,Search update 2023-11-13,,

METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of datasets from three previous studies. Patients aged ≥55 yr who underwent elective noncardiac surgery were enrolled. Preoperative cognitive impairment was defined as Mini-Mental State Examination <27. Pain intensity with movement was assessed using an 11-point numeric rating scale at 12-h intervals during the first 72 h after surgery; time-weighted average (TWA) pain score was calculated. Primary outcome was the occurrence of delirium within the first 5 postoperative days. Mediation analysis was used to investigate the relationships between cognitive impairment, pain score, and delirium. RESULTS: A total of 1497 patients were included. Prevalence of preoperative cognitive impairment was 40.3% (603/1497). Patients with cognitive impairment suffered higher TWA pain score within 72 h (4 [3-5] vs 3 [2-5], P=0.004) and more delirium within 5 days (12.9% [78/603] vs 4.9% [44/894], P<0.001) when compared with those without. Total and direct associations between cognitive impairment and delirium were (adjusted β) 8.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.8-12.0%; P<0.001) and 7.8% (95% CI, 4.4-12.0%; P<0.001), respectively. A significant indirect association with acute pain was observed between cognitive impairment and delirium (adjusted β=0.4%; 95% CI, 0.1-1.0%; P=0.006), accounting for 4.9% of the total effect.

Previous studies have suggested that, on average, HRQoL returns to premorbid normal levels in the months following major surgery. However, the averaging of effect over a studied cohort may hide the variation of individual HRQoL changes. The proportions of patients who have a varied HRQoL response (stable, improvement, or a deterioration) after major oncological surgery is poorly understood. The study aims to describe the patterns of these HRQoL changes at 6 months after surgery, and to assess the patients and next-of-kin regret regarding the decision to undergo surgery. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This prospective observational cohort study is carried out at the University Hospitals of Geneva, Switzerland. We include patients over 18 years old undergoing gastrectomy, esophagectomy, pancreas resection or hepatectomy. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients in each group with changes in HRQoL (improvement, stability or deterioration) 6 months after surgery, using a validated minimal clinically important difference of 10 points in HRQoL. The secondary outcome is to assess whether patients and their next-of-kin may regret their decision to undergo surgery at 6 months. We measure the HRQoL using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire before and 6 months after surgery. We assess regret with the Decision Regret Scale (DRS) at 6 months after surgery. Key other perioperative data include preoperative and postoperative place of residence, preoperative anxiety and depression (HADS scale), preoperative disability (WHODAS V.2.0), preoperative frailty (Clinical Frailty Scale), preoperative cognitive function (Mini-Mental State Examination) and preoperative comorbidities. A follow-up at 12 months is planned. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was first approved by the Geneva Ethical Committee for Research (ID 2020-00536) on 28 April 2020. The results of this study will be presented at national and international scientific meetings, and publications will be submitted to an open-access peer-reviewed journal.

Its greatest risk factor is preoperative cognitive impairment. Cognitive impairment also predicts higher likelihood of postoperative complications. While the cause of disparity in outcomes is likely multifactorial, the ability to correctly follow perioperative instructions may be one modifiable component. The purpose of this study was to determine whether cognitive impairment led to reduced preoperative instruction compliance and if so, identify barriers and enact a tailored care-plan to close the gap. Our preoperative clinic implemented routine Mini-Cog screening to identify older (age ≥ 65) surgical patients at increased risk. All patients received the same instructions and, on day of surgery, were surveyed to determine correct execution of nil per os guidelines, chlorhexidine wipe use and medication management. Data was stratified by cognitive status to evaluate whether impairment predicted instruction execution. Feedback from patients and families were compiled. Of those who screened negative for impairment, 68% correctly followed instructions, while 84.2% of those impaired struggled with ≥1 instruction(s); impaired patients were more likely to incorrectly follow instructions (OR = 10.5, p-value = 0.001). Areas for change were identified and team-based solutions were enacted with additional support for those with impairment. We found a clear difference in correct execution with respect to cognitive status. By improving instructions as an institution and adding additional support for those with impairment, the compliance gap was significantly reduced. Targeting perioperative instructions and tailoring care in this population may be one modifiable component in the outcome disparity they face.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16772,Search update 2023-11-13,,

The aim of this study was to compare surgical and oncological results of geriatric rectal cancer patients using inflammation-based prognostic scores. METHODS: The prospectively maintained database of 991 rectal cancer patients treated at our center between 2007 and 2020 were analyzed. All conventional clinicopathologic features, and oncologic outcomes are compared between patients ≥ 65 years old (geriatric patients: Group I) and < 65 years old (non-geriatric patients: Group II). The modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS) and the C-reactive protein-albumin ratio (CAR), were determined. The prognostic value of mGPS and CAR as well as the well-known clinico-pathologic factors to predict surgical morbidity, mortality, local and/or distant recurrence, and overall survival was assessed. RESULTS: There were 567 (57.2%) patients who were ≥ 65 years old (Group I; 349 males, median age 74 [range 65-9]) years) and 424 (42.8%) who were < 65 years old (Group II; 252 males, median age 58 [range 20-64] years). The high-grade [Clavien-Dindo III-IV] complications rates of Group I and Group II patients sere 20% (n = 113), and 9% (n = 37), respectively. High-grade complications were related to mGPS (p < 0.001) and CAR (p < 0.001) values. The high-grade complication rate was found to be higher in Group I than in Group II, and this was statistically significant (p < 0.001). High preoperative mGPS and CAR values were significantly associated with postoperative mortality (p < 0.001). In Cox multivariate analysis, mGPS (p = 0.003) and CAR (p = 0.001) were significantly in correlation with lowered overall survival. The mGPS and CAR were found to be independent prognostic factors for overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: The mGPS and CAR can predict severe postoperative complications and early mortality. mGPS, and CAR have a powerful prognostic value and the potential clinical usefulness to predict decreased overall survival in both geriatric and non-geriatric rectal cancer patients.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16886,Search update 2023-11-13,,

The goal of this study was to characterize the relationship between specific patient factors including comorbidities and outcomes in geriatric hip fractures, including length of stay, unplanned ICU admission, discharge disposition, complications, and mortality. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of a trauma database from five Level 1 and Level 2 trauma centers of patients with hip fractures of the femoral neck and intertrochanteric region who underwent treatment using hip pinning, hemiarthroplasty, total hip arthroplasty, cephalomedullary nailing, or dynamic hip screw fixation. Mortality was the primary outcome variable (including in-hospital mortality, 30-day mortality, 60-day mortality, and 90-day mortality). Secondary outcome variables included in-hospital adverse events, unplanned transfer to the ICU, postoperative length of stay, and discharge disposition. Regression analyses were used for evaluation of relationships between comorbidities as independent variables and primary and secondary outcomes as dependent variables. RESULTS: Two thousand three hundred patients were included. The mortality was 1.8%, 7.0%, 10.9%, and 14.1% for in-hospital, 30-day, 60-day, and 90-day mortality, respectively. Diabetes and cognitive impairment present on admission were associated with mortality at all-time intervals. COPD was the only comorbidity that signaled in-hospital adverse event with an odds ratio of 1.67 (P = 0.012). No patient factors, time to surgery, or comorbidities signaled unplanned ICU transfer. Patients with renal failure and COPD had longer hospital stays after surgery. CONCLUSION: Geriatric hip fractures continue to have high short-term morbidity and mortality. Identifying patients with increased odds of early mortality and adverse events can help teams optimize care and outcomes. Patients with diabetes, cognitive impairment, renal failure, and COPD may benefit from continued and improved medical optimization during the perioperative period as well as being more closely managed by a medicine team without delaying time to the operating room.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 17039,Search update 2023-11-13,,

S.",Predictors of Hospice Discharge After Surgical Fixation of Hip Fractures,"BACKGROUND: Each year, over 300,000 people older than 65 years are hospitalized for hip fractures. Given the notable morbidity and mortality faced by elderly patients in the postinjury period, recommendations have been put forth for integrating palliative and, when needed, hospice care to improve patients' quality of life. Our objective was to (1) understand the proportion of patients discharged to hospice after hip fracture surgery and their 30-day mortality rates and (2) identify the independent predictors of discharge to hospice. METHODS: We retrospectively queried the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program for all hip fracture surgeries between the years of 2016 and 2018. Included cases were stratified into two cohorts: cases involving a discharge to hospice and nonhospice discharge. Variables assessed included patient demographics, comorbidities, perioperative characteristics, and postoperative outcomes. Differences between hospice and nonhospice patients were compared using chi-squared analysis or the Fisher exact test for categorical variables and Student t -tests for continuous variables. A binary logistic regression model was used to assess independent predictors of hospice discharge with 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Overall, 31,531 surgically treated hip fractures were identified, of which only 281 (0.9%) involved a discharge to hospice. Patients discharged to hospice had a 67% 30-day mortality rate in comparison with 5.6% of patients not discharged to hospice ( P < 0.001). Disseminated cancer, dependent functional status, >10% weight loss over 6 months preoperatively, and preoperative cognitive deficit were the strongest predictors of hospice discharge with 30-day mortality after hip fracture surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Current hospice utilization in hip fracture patients remains low, but 30-day mortality in these patients is high. An awareness of the associations between patient characteristics and discharge to hospice with 30-day mortality is important for surgeons to consider when discussing postoperative expectations and outcomes with these patients.

I., Baba, H.",Frailty and surgical outcomes in gastrointestinal cancer: Integration of geriatric assessment and prehabilitation into surgical practice for vulnerable patients,"As life expectancy increases, the older population continues to grow rapidly, resulting in increased requirement for surgery for older patients with gastrointestinal cancer. Older individuals represent a heterogeneous group in terms of physiological reserves, co-morbidity, cognitive impairment, and disability. Owing to the lack of treatment guidelines for vulnerable patients with gastrointestinal cancer, these patients are more likely to be at risk of undertreatment or overtreatment. Hence, the identification of frail patients with gastrointestinal cancer would improve cancer treatment outcomes. Although there is no standardized geriatric assessment tool, a growing body of research has shown associations of frailty with adverse postoperative outcomes and poor prognosis after resection of gastrointestinal tract and hepatobiliary-pancreatic cancers. Emerging evidence suggests that prehabilitation, which includes exercise and nutritional support, can improve preoperative functional capacity, postoperative recovery, and surgical outcomes, particularly in frail patients with gastrointestinal cancer. We reviewed major geriatric assessment tools for identification of frail patients and summarized clinical studies on frailty and surgical outcomes, as well as prehabilitation or rehabilitation in gastrointestinal tract and hepatobiliary-pancreatic cancers. The integration of preoperative geriatric assessment and prehabilitation of frail patients in clinical practice may improve surgical outcomes. In addition, improving preoperative vulnerability and preventing functional decline after surgery is important in providing favorable long-term survival in patients with gastrointestinal cancer.

Postoperative delirium is related to poor prognosis. But the relationship between preoperative anxiety and postoperative delirium among older patients undergoing elective surgery for lumbar disc herniation is not clear. AIMS: The study aimed to investigate if preoperative anxiety is an independent risk factor of postoperative delirium among older patients undergoing elective surgery for lumbar disc herniation. METHODS: The medical records of 1290 patients undergoing elective surgery for lumbar disc herniation at a single institution from 2016 through 2021 were reviewed. Of 863 eligible patients, 225 (26.1%) patients had been diagnosed with anxiety by a board-certified psychiatrist and constituted the Anxiety group; the remaining 638 patients constituted the no-anxiety group. The demographics, baseline, operative variable and postoperative complications were collected and compared between the two groups. The primary outcome of this study was the incidence of delirium, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fifth Edition, during a hospital stay after surgery for lumbar disc herniation. The relationship between anxiety and postoperative delirium was determined through multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The demographics and comorbidity were similar between the two groups, except for age, sex, alcohol use and cerebrovascular disease. The operative variables were different between the two groups. The incidence of postoperative complications other than postoperative delirium was also similar between the two groups. In total, 86 patients (9.97%) had an episode of postoperative delirium, with anxiety group patients experiencing approximately a twofold higher rate (15.6% vs 7.99%). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, anxiety was an independent predictor of postoperative delirium in older patients undergoing elective surgery for lumbar disc herniation (OR 2.228, 95% CI 1.494-3.416, p = 0.009). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that anxiety is an independent risk factor of postoperative delirium among older patients undergoing elective surgery for lumbar disc herniation.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of topical application of a eutectic mixture of local anesthetics (EMLA) cream over the endotracheal tube (ETT) cuff on the incidence and severity of POST, cough, and hoarseness of voice in adults after surgery. METHODS: In this randomized, placebo-controlled study, adult patients 18 to 65 years old, in American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II, and of either sex were scheduled to receive 5% EMLA cream (intervention arm) or lubricant gel (placebo-controlled arm) applied over the ETT cuff. POST was graded as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3). A score of ≥2 was considered as significant POST. The incidence of POST at the sixth postoperative hour was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of POST at 0, second, and 24 hours, and the incidence of significant POST (score ≥2). The incidence and severity of postoperative cough and hoarseness of voice were recorded simultaneously. RESULTS: Two hundred and four patients completed the study. The incidence of POST was significantly lower in the EMLA group versus placebo at the sixth postoperative hour (4.9% vs 40.1%; relative risk [RR], 0.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.05-0.29; P < .001); and at 0 hour (74.5% vs 93.1%; RR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7-0.9; P < .001) and second hour (51.9% vs 84.3%; RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.5-0.75; P < .001) but comparable at 24 hours (1.9% vs 3.9%; RR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.09-2.67; P = .4). The number needed to treat to prevent POST with EMLA cream application was 5 at 0 hour and 3 at the second and sixth hour. The proportion of patients with significant POST over 24 hours were less in the EMLA group (9.8% vs 43.1%; P < .001).

Lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF) is considered to be favorable for MOB patients. However, little scientific research has been carried out for this issue due to variety of the pathogenesis. The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical results of MOB patients and first-time surgery patients who underwent LLIF for lumbar spinal stenosis with degenerative scoliosis and/or degenerative spondylolisthesis (spinal instability). Materials and Methods: LLIF was performed for lumbar spinal stenosis with spinal instability in 55 consecutive cases of single hospital (30 males, 25 females, average age: 69). Clinical outcomes were compared between the MOB patient group (MOB group) and the first surgical patient group (F group). We evaluated the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores and JOA Back Pain Evaluation Questionnaire (JOABPEQ) before and 2 years after surgery. MOB patients were defined as those who have had one or more lumbar surgery on the same intervertebral or adjacent vertebrae in the past. Results: There were 20 cases (12 males, 8 females, average age: 71) in MOB group, and 35 cases (19 males, 16 females, average age: 68) in the F group. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of age, sex, number of intervertebral fixations, modic change in fused intervertebral end plate, score of brief scale for evaluation of psychiatric problem, lumbar lordosis, and sagittal vertical axis before and after surgery.

We have been performing routine pre-operative comprehensive assessments, including evaluation of cognitive function, handgrip strength, oral hygiene, and nutritional status, in patients aged ≥ 65 years since April 2021. This study aimed to examine the completion rate of pre-operative comprehensive assessment and assess the prevalence of pre-operative undiagnosed cognitive impairment. METHODS: In this prospective observational study including patients aged ≥ 65 years scheduled for elective surgery with general or regional anesthesia, cognitive impairment was defined as a Mini-Cog score ≤ 2, and its associations with handgrip strength, oral hygiene, and nutritional status were evaluated. Oral hygiene and nutritional status were assessed using an oral frailty self-checklist and the Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form, respectively. The incidence of pre-operative undiagnosed cognitive impairment was estimated, and its associated factors were explored with multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 331 eligible patients, the completion rate was 97.7% (305/312).

PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred twenty (N=220) patients 65 years or older with total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: IADL status was evaluated for 6 activities. Participants chose ""able,"" ""need help,"" or ""unable"" according to their capacity of executing these IADL. If they chose ""need help"" or ""unable"" for 1 or more items, they were defined as ""disabled."" Their usual gait speed (UGS), range of motion for the knee, isometric knee extension strength (IKES), pain status, depressive symptoms, pain catastrophizing, and self-efficacy were evaluated as predictors. Baseline and follow-up assessments were conducted 1 month before and 6 months after KA, respectively. Logistic regression analyses with IADL status as the dependent variable were performed at follow-up. All models were adjusted using age, sex, severity of the knee deformity, operation type (TKA or UKA), and preoperative IADL status as covariates. RESULTS: In total, 166 patients completed the follow-up assessment, and 83 (50.0%) reported IADL disability 6 months after KA. Preoperative UGS, IKES on the non-operated side, and self-efficacy were statistically significantly different between those with a disability at follow-up and those who did not and were therefore included in logistic regression models as independent variables. UGS (odds ratio, 3.22; 95% CI, 1.38-7.56; P=.007) was determined as a significant independent variable. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated the importance of evaluating preoperative gait speed to predict the presence of IADL disability in older adults 6 months after KA. Patients with poorer preoperative mobility should be provided careful postoperative care and treatment.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16977,Search update 2023-11-13,,

This study aimed to explore the predictive potential of frailty assessment in the prognosis of elderly patients undergoing bypass surgery. METHODS: This study assessed the preoperative frailty according to the Fried's frailty phenotype, and included 150 frail and 150 non-frail elderly patients (≥ 65 y) who underwent bypass surgery. The present study evaluated the prognosis of elderly patients based on sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, and collected clinical indicators to construct logistic regression models with the prognosis as the dependent variable, to explore the potential predictive ability of preoperative frailty. Moreover, this study focused on the complications and analyzed the relationship between preoperative frailty and postoperative complications. RESULTS: In the present study, 244 patients were divided into the favorable prognosis group and 56 patients were divided into the unfavorable prognosis group. Logistic regression analysis showed that increased myoglobin and high cardiac function classification were independent risk factors for unfavorable prognosis in elderly patients undergoing bypass surgery. The discrimination of the clinical prediction model was determined by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and the area under curve (AUC) was 0.928. After adding preoperative frailty assessment, the AUC was improved to 0.939. This study found a significant correlation between preoperative frailty and postoperative complications, mainly in the circulatory system. CONCLUSION: Preoperative frailty assessment could be a predictive factor for the prognosis of elderly patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. According to our study, frailty assessment and appropriate intervention before bypass surgery may be beneficial to the enhanced recovery after cardiac surgery.

BACKGROUND: Although the use of preoperative comprehensive geriatric assessment to improve pre/peri and postoperative mortality has been reported for many surgical domains, its use prior to dental surgery has not been reported previously. METHODS: The data were collected retrospectively from the dental notes of 52 patients referred from the Special Care Dental (SCD) Department to the PROKARE service for optimisation prior to dental treatment under GA/CS using a case note study approach. The data extracted included patient demographic characteristics, medical history, clinical management and the treatment outcomes for each patient. The data extracted was analysed with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Key reasons for referral were caries management, retained roots and poor co-operation. Multiple co-morbidities were noted among the patients referred, with 14 (27%) having four or more co-morbidities. The PROKARE assessment identified issues such as treatment could be carried out under CS instead of GA; consent; and the need for medication change and/or further medical investigations. As per recommendations from PROKARE, 39 patients (75%) received dental treatment while five (10%) did not receive treatment, and a further eight (15%) died prior to treatment. CONCLUSION: Geriatric assessment and optimisation-based preoperative clinics in the dental management of frail, elderly patients having treatment under GA or CS techniques is valuable, but further research and assessment of current service provision are needed to increase the evidence base.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 11456,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Laser laryngeal surgery (LLS) requires the administration of low levels of oxygen, which may increase the risk of desaturation and brain function impairment. This prospective randomized trial aimed to compare the effects of desflurane and propofol-based general anesthesia on the occurrence of early postoperative cognitive decline in elderly patients undergoing LLS. METHODS: Seventy-three patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists grade I or II and at least 65 years of age were randomly allocated to receive either desflurane-based (Group D) or propofol-based (Group P) anesthesia during LLS. The standard anesthesia protocol was performed, with a bispectral index between 40 and 60 and a mean arterial pressure within 20% of baseline values. Intraoperative regional oxygen saturation values were recorded. Each patient was assessed using the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) test during the preoperative period (baseline), 30 min after extubation in the postanesthesia care unit, and 1, 3, and 24 h after surgery. RESULTS: MMSE scores improved slightly in both groups compared to baseline during the early postoperative period, but these increases were not statistically significant. No significant differences were identified in MMSE scores between groups. Only three patients (9.6%) in group D and one patient (3.1%) in group P developed cognitive impairment (p = 0.583). CONCLUSION: Low intraoperative inspired oxygen concentration during short-duration LLS did not reduce early postoperative cognitive function in elderly patients. Desflurane or propofol-based anesthesia had similar effects on early neurocognition after LLS.

We hypothesised that a nighttime dose of dexmedetomidine would reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium as compared to placebo. Methods: This single-centre, parallel-arm, randomised, placebo-controlled superiority trial evaluated whether a short nighttime dose of intravenous dexmedetomidine (1 μg/kg over 40 min) would reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium in patients 60 years of age or older undergoing elective cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients were randomised to receive dexmedetomidine or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome was delirium on postoperative day one. Secondary outcomes included delirium within three days of surgery, 30-, 90-, and 180-day abbreviated Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores, Patient Reported Outcome Measures Information System quality of life scores, and all-cause mortality. The study was registered as NCT02856594 on ClinicalTrials.gov on August 5, 2016, before the enrolment of any participants. Findings: Of 469 patients that underwent randomisation to placebo (n = 235) or dexmedetomidine (n = 234), 75 met a prespecified drop criterion before the study intervention. Thus, 394 participants (188 dexmedetomidine; 206 placebo) were analysed in the modified intention-to-treat cohort (median age 69 [IQR 64, 74] years; 73.1% male [n = 288]; 26·9% female [n = 106]). Postoperative delirium status on day one was missing for 30 (7.6%) patients. Among those in whom it could be assessed, the primary outcome occurred in 5 of 175 patients (2.9%) in the dexmedetomidine group and 16 of 189 patients (8.5%) in the placebo group (OR 0.32, 95% CI: 0.10–0.83; P = 0.029). A non-significant but higher proportion of participants experienced delirium within three days postoperatively in the placebo group (25/177; 14.1%) compared to the dexmedetomidine group (14/160; 8.8%; OR 0.58; 95% CI, 0.28–1.15). No significant differences between groups were observed in secondary outcomes or safety. Interpretation: Our findings suggested that in elderly cardiac surgery patients with a low baseline risk of postoperative delirium and extubated within 12 h of ICU admission, a short nighttime dose of dexmedetomidine decreased the incidence of delirium on postoperative day one. Although non-statistically significant, our findings also suggested a clinical meaningful difference in the three-day incidence of postoperative delirium.

We aimed to identify the ratio of abnormal results for three clinically applicable screening tools to assess the risk of frailty, and their association with adverse outcomes in a cohort of elderly surgical patients. METHODS: In this prospective pilot study, patients ≥65 years undergoing preoperative evaluation for elective surgery were included and subjected to three frailty screening tests; Program of Research to Integrate Services for the Maintenance of Autonomy 7-item questionnaire (PRISMA7), Timed Up and Go (TUG), and Clock Drawing Test (CDT). The primary outcome was the incidence of abnormal testing, and secondary outcomes were the association between abnormal tests and mortality, readmission, delirium, surgical complications and non-home discharge. RESULTS: Out of 99 patients, 41%, 37%, and 43% had abnormal PRISMA7, TUG, and CDT screening, respectively. Postoperative delirium was more likely to occur in patients with abnormal TUG screening (19% vs. 3%, p = .011) and CDT (17% vs. 2%, p = .019). When analyzing screening tool combinations, patients with abnormal PRISMA7 and TUG had a higher rate of non-home discharge (38% vs. 17%, p = .029); and patients with abnormal TUG and CDT had a higher rate of postoperative delirium (25% vs. 3%, p = .006) and any surgical complication (58% vs. 38%, p = .037); and patients with abnormal results from all three tools had a higher rate of postoperative delirium (21% vs. 5%, p = .045) and non-home discharge (42% vs. 18%, p = .034). CONCLUSION: Approximately 40% of elderly surgical patients have abnormal PRISMA7, TUG, and CDT screening tests for frailty, and they are associated individually or in combination with increased risk of adverse postoperative outcomes.

E.",Anesthetic Practice Trends and Perceptions Toward Postoperative Delirium: A Mixed-Methods Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Delirium is the most common postoperative complication in older adults, though anesthesiologist awareness of delirium prevention guidelines-and associated practice trends-remains unknown. METHODS: This was a convergent mixed-methods study, which simultaneously analyzed quantitative and qualitative data to determine delirium guideline awareness among anesthesiologists and practice patterns based on guideline recommendations. Quantitative data were abstracted from the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group database for noncardiac surgery patients (2009-2020) aged 65 years and older. Linear trends were reported for select guideline-based delirium prevention recommendations via regression modeling. Anesthesiologists (n = 40) from a major academic center without a structured delirium reduction program on hospital wards were then surveyed regarding knowledge and practices with respect to postoperative delirium. For qualitative data, 3 focus groups were held to further discuss guideline awareness and identify challenges with delirium prevention. RESULTS: Quantitative results demonstrated a significant decline in the proportion of cases with midazolam between 2009 and 2020, with the largest decrease observed with urologic surgeries (-3.9%/y; 95% confidence interval [CI], -4.2 to -3.6; P < .001). Use of regional anesthesia increased over this period, particularly with gynecologic surgeries (+2.3%/y; 95% CI, 1.2-3.4; P = .001). Anesthesiologist survey results revealed variable guideline awareness, as 21 of 39 (54%) respondents reported being aware of guidelines for anesthetic management of older adults. Importantly, unawareness of delirium management guidelines was the most frequently cited challenge (17 of 37, 46%) when caring for older adults. Finally, focus group participants were largely unaware of postoperative delirium guidelines. However, participants conveyed key barriers to delirium identification and prevention, including the unclear pathophysiology, nonmodifiable risk factors, and system-based hospital challenges. Participants also expressed a desire for decision-support systems, integrated within the perioperative workflow, that provide evidence-based recommendations for reducing delirium risk. CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative practice trends are indicative of an improving environment for postoperative delirium. However, delirium guideline awareness remains variable among anesthesiologists, and key barriers continue to exist for identifying and preventing postoperative delirium.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 11318,Search update 2023-11-13,,

A secondary objective was to compare between frailty indexes that are used at our medical center. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of head and neck cancer patients operated between 2007 and 2021 was performed. RESULTS: One hundred and fifteen patients were included and divided into three age groups: 50-69 years, 70-79 years and ≥ 80 years. Although most elderly patients had a significantly higher rate of comorbidities and lower Norton scores, no statistically significant difference was found between the groups in postoperative morbidity rates, intensive care unit (ICU) or internal medicine department admissions, re-hospitalization in 1-3 months, and in falling risk (MFS-Morse Fall Scale). On multivariate analysis there was a positive correlation between preoperative cerebrovascular accident (CVA), dementia, and cardiac arrhythmias, and the probability for developing postoperative complication. The latter findings were not related to the patients' age. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we did not find higher postoperative morbidity rates among elderly population in comparison to younger age groups, and therefore, our current evaluation system could not assist in identifying elderly at risk. However, prediction of operative risk based on physiologic reserve or frailty is an important tool in the evaluation of elderly head and neck cancer patients.

K.",Surgical prehabilitation in older and frail individuals: a scoping review,"BACKGROUND: Older individuals who are scheduled for elective procedures often have co-morbidities at baseline and may be classified as frail. Both older age and frailty are associated with poor fitness and preoperative deconditioning, which can be predictors of postoperative complications. Prehabilitation aims to improve preoperative health in order to reduce complications and expedite postoperative recovery. To date, the effect of prehabilitation on improving outcomes in older and frail individuals is unclear, and the evidence in support of multi-modal treatments is evolving. METHODS: In this scoping review, searches of PubMed and Cochrane Library between August 2012 and August 2022 were performed to identify studies investigating the efficacy of prehabilitation prior to surgical procedures. RESULTS: A total of 36 articles were included in the review. Most of these examined the efficacy of unimodal (n=21) prehabilitation interventions, most commonly exercise therapy. Multimodal prehabilitation programs (n=15) included a variety of intervention components (e.g., exercise training, nutrition, psychological intervention or geriatric consultation). The most commonly studied populations were patients with gastrointestinal cancer (mostly colorectal cancer). Exercise therapy and multimodal interventions are likely to be of greatest impact on postoperative functional decline in patients awaiting total knee or hip arthroplasty, and cancer-related resection surgery (e.g., due to colorectal, gastric or lung cancer) in older and frail patients. CONCLUSIONS: Presurgical prehabilitation showed the potential to diminish postoperative outcomes in older and frail patients prior to surgery. However, adequately powered, randomized controlled, assessor blinded intervention trials demonstrating overall benefit of prehabilitation are needed.

The majority of patients have pre-existing conditions that get worsened by unplanned surgery. OBJECTIVE: Purpose of this article was to evaluate if a is single shot of dexamethasone with levobupivacaine administered intrathecally reduces postoperative pain and cognitive complications in patients with proximal femoral fractures. METHODS: The study was performed at a level II trauma center which is a part of a teaching hospital with a catchment population of around 300,000 patients, the first author's affiliation. Around 500 PrFF are performed yearly in the center. All participants gave oral and written informed consent before randomization. RESULTS: In total, 60 patients with a PrFF, ASA status 2 or 3 were randomized into two groups for spinal anaesthesia as DLSA study group (received 8 mg of dexamethasone and 12.5 mg of 0.5 % levobupivacaine) or LSA control group (received 12.5 mg of 0,5 % levobupivacaine). Postoperative cognitive disturbance was evaluated using simplified Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) scale, pain intensity was measured using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and blood samples for defining cortisol concentrations were taken before and after the surgical procedure. The primary outcomes were effects of intrathecal dexamethasone on plasma cortisol affecting cognitive disturbances. Secondary outcomes included pain scores and length of hospital stay. The DLSA group demonstrated a reduced incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), p=0.043, longer analgesia duration, p<0.001, decreased cortisol levels and shorter hospitalization p=0.045. Intrathecal dexamethasone was the only significant predictor of postoperative delirium, OR 7.76, p=0.019.

In particular, PACU-D is among common postoperative complications of elderly patients. As PACU-D may be associated with postoperative delirium, early detection of at-risk patients and strategies to prevent PACU-D are important. We characterized EEG baseline signatures of patients who developed PACU-D following surgery and general anesthesia and patients who did not. DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a post-hoc analysis of preoperative EEG recordings between patients with and without PACU-D, as indicated by positive bCAM scores post general anesthesia and surgery. PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS: Preoperative baseline EEG recordings from 89 patients were recorded at controlled eyes-open (focused wakefulness) and eyes-closed (relaxed wakefulness) conditions. We computed power spectral densities, permutation entropy, spectral entropy and spectral edge frequency to see if these parameters can reflect potential baseline EEG differences between PACU-D (31.5%) and noPACU-D (68.5%) patients. Wilcoxon's Rank Sum Test as well as AUC values were used to determine statistical significance. MAIN RESULTS: Baseline EEG recordings showed significant differences between PACU-D and noPACU-D patients preoperatively. Compared to the noPACU-D group, PACU-D patients presented with lower power in higher frequencies during relaxed and focused wakefulness alike. These differences in power led to AUC values of 0.73 [0.59;0.85] (permutation entropy) and 0.72 [0.61;0.83] (spectral edge frequency) indicative of a ""fair"" performance to separate patients with and without PACU-D. CONCLUSIONS: The baseline EEG of relaxed wakefulness as well as focused wakefulness may be used to assess the risk of developing PACU-D following surgery under general anesthesia. Moreover, routinely used monitoring parameters capture these differences as well, potentially allowing an easy transfer to clinical settings.

Based on the hypothesis that intraoperative dexmedetomidine sedation would lower postoperative delirium than propofol sedation would, the authors compared the incidence of postoperative delirium in older adults, using the mentioned sedatives. Methods: This double-blinded, randomized controlled study included 748 patients, aged 65 yr or older, who were scheduled for elective lower extremity orthopedic surgery, between June 2017 and October 2021. Patients were randomized equally into two groups in a 1:1 ratio according to the intraoperative sedative used (dexmedetomidine vs. propofol). The postoperative delirium incidence was considered the primary outcome measure; it was determined using the confusion assessment method, on the first three postoperative days. The mean arterial pressure and heart rate were evaluated as secondary outcomes. Results: The authors enrolled 732 patients in the intention-to-treat analyses. The delirium incidence was lower in the dexmedetomidine group than in the propofol group (11 [3.0%] vs. 24 [6.6%]; odds ratio, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.201 to 0.86; P = 0.036). During sedation, the mean arterial pressure (median [interquartile range] mmHg) was higher in the dexmedetomidine group (77 [71 to 84]) than in the propofol group (74 [69 to 79]; P < 0.001); however, it significantly fell lower (74 [68 to 80]) than that of the propofol group (80 [74 to 87]) in the postanesthesia care unit (P < 0.001). Lower heart rates (beats/min) were recorded with the use of dexmedetomidine than with propofol, both during sedation (60 [55 to 66] vs. 63 [58 to 70]) and in the postanesthesia care unit (64 [58 to 72] vs. 68 [62-77]; P < 0.001).

K.",Association of Insurance Type With Inpatient Surgery 30-Day Complications and Costs,"INTRODUCTION: Safety-net hospitals (SNHs) have higher postoperative complications and costs versus low-burden hospitals. Do low socioeconomic status/vulnerable patients receive care at lower-quality hospitals or are there factors beyond providers' control? We studied the association of private, Medicare, and vulnerable insurance type with complications/costs in a high-burden SNH. METHODS: Retrospective inpatient cohort study using National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) data (2013-2019) with cost data risk-adjusted by frailty, preoperative serious acute conditions (PASC), case status, and expanded operative stress score (OSS) to evaluate 30-day unplanned reoperations, any complication, Clavien-Dindo IV (CDIV) complications, and hospitalization variable costs. RESULTS: Cases (Private 1517; Medicare 1224; Vulnerable 3648) with patient mean age 52.3 y [standard deviation = 14.7] and 47.3% male. Adjusting for frailty and OSS, vulnerable patients had higher odds of PASC (aOR = 1.71, CI = 1.39-2.10, P < 0.001) versus private. Adjusting for frailty, PASC and OSS, Medicare (aOR = 1.27, CI = 1.06-1.53, P = 0.009), and vulnerable (aOR = 2.44, CI = 2.13-2.79, P < 0.001) patients were more likely to undergo urgent/emergent surgeries. Vulnerable patients had increased odds of reoperation and any complications versus private. Variable cost percentage change was similar between private and vulnerable after adjusting for case status. Urgent/emergent case status increased percentage change costs by 32.31%. We simulated ""switching"" numbers of private (3648) versus vulnerable (1517) cases resulting in an estimated variable cost of $49.275 million, a 25.2% decrease from the original $65.859 million. CONCLUSIONS: Increased presentation acuity (PASC and urgent/emergent surgeries) in vulnerable patients drive increased odds of complications and costs versus private, suggesting factors beyond providers' control. The greatest impact on outcomes may be from decreasing the incidence of urgent/emergent surgeries by improving access to care.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16902,Search update 2023-11-13,,

X., Bettick, D., Gearhart, S. L.",Validation of the self-reported domains of the Edmonton Frail Scale in patients 65 years of age and older,"INTRODUCTION: In the era of virtual care, self-reported tools are beneficial for preoperative assessments and facilitating postoperative planning. We have previously reported the use of the Edmonton Frailty Scale (EFS) as a valid preoperative assessment tool. OBJECTIVE: We wished to validate the self-reported domains of the EFS (srEFS) by examining its association with loss of independence (LOI) and mortality. METHODS: This is a post-hoc analysis of a single-institution observational study of patients 65 years of age or older undergoing multi-specialty surgical procedures and assessed with the EFS in the preoperative setting. Exploratory data analysis was used to determine the threshold for identifying frailty using the srEFS. Procedures were classified using the Operative Stress Score (OSS) scored 1 to 5 (lowest to highest). Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) was utilized to risk-adjust. LOI was described as requiring more support at discharge and mortality was defined as death occurring up to 30 days following surgery. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the ability of the srEFS to predict the outcomes of interest in relation to the EFS. RESULTS: Five hundred thirty-five patients were included. Exploratory analysis confirmed best positive predictive value for srEFS was greater or equal to 5. Overall, 113 (21 percent) patients were considered high risk for frailty (HRF) and 179 (33 percent) patients had an OSS greater or equal to 5. LOI occurred in 7 percent (38 patients) and the mortality rate was 4 percent (21 patients). ROC analysis showed that the srEFS performed similar to the standard EFS with no difference in discriminatory thresholds for predicting LOI and mortality. Examination of the domains of the EFS not included in the srEFS demonstrated a lack of association between cognitive decline and the outcomes of interest. However, functional status assessed with either the Get up and Go (EFS only) or self-reported ADLs was independently associated with increased risk for LOI. CONCLUSION: This study shows that self-reported EFS may be an optional preoperative tool that can be used in the virtual setting to identify patients at HRF. Early identification of patients at risk for LOI and mortality provides an opportunity to implement targeted strategies to improve patient care.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 17030,Search update 2023-11-13,,

L., Wagner, S., Denkinger, M., Dallmeier, D.",Frailty index and its association with the onset of postoperative delirium in older adults undergoing elective surgery,"BACKGROUND: The association of frailty based on the accumulation of deficits with postoperative delirium (POD) has been poorly examined. We aimed to analyze this association in older patients undergoing elective surgery. METHODS: Preoperative data was used to build a 30-item frailty index (FI) for participants of the PAWEL-study. Delirium was defined by a combination of I-CAM and chart review. Using logistic regressions models we analysed the association between frailty and POD adjusting for age, sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, education and type of surgery. RESULTS: Among 701 participants (mean age 77.1, 52.4% male) median FI was 0.27 (Q1 0.20| Q3 0.34), with 528 (75.3%) frail participants (FI ≥ 0.2). Higher median FI were seen in orthopedic than cardiac surgery patients (0.28 versus 0.23), and in women (0.28 versus 0.25 in men). Frail participants showed a higher POD incidence proportion (25.4% versus 17.9% in non-frail). An increased odds for POD was observed in frail versus non-frail participants (OR 2.14 [95% CI 1.33, 3.44], c-statistic 0.71). A 0.1 increment of FI was associated with OR 1.57 [95% CI 1.30, 1.90] (c-statistic 0.72) for POD. No interaction with sex or type of surgery was detected. Adding timed-up-and-go-test and handgrip strength to the FI did not improve discrimination. CONCLUSION: Our data showed a significant association between frailty defined through a 30-item FI and POD among older adults undergoing elective surgery. Adding functional measures to the FI did not improve discrimination. Hence, our preoperative 30-item FI can help to identify patients with increased odds for POD.

METHODS: Data from consecutive frail patients with indwelling urinary catheter undergoing the Rezūm™ therapy (Boston Scientific Corporation, Marlborough, MA) at a single center between October 2017 and June 2021 were prospectively collected. The included patients were deemed unfit or at high risk of complications for conventional benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) surgery. Prostate volumes up to 120 mL were considered eligible. The primary endpoint was successful cessation of catheter dependency, assessed postoperatively and up to 1 year of follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 24 men met our inclusion criteria. The median age, Charlson comorbidity index, and duration of preoperative catheterization were 77 years (IQR 67-86), 6 (IQR 3-7), and 113 days (IQR 87-159), respectively. Two cases (8.3%) of postoperative complications were recorded (Clavien II and Clavien IIIa). After a median postoperative catheterization time of 21 days (IQR 11-32), all patients regained spontaneous voiding. During follow-up, two patients died and a total of 22 patients completed the 1 year follow-up. All patients maintained spontaneous voiding without recurrence of urinary retention. No surgical retreatment was performed. In terms of pharmacological management, 22/24 patients (91.7%) had a BPH medication pre-Rezūm™; this decreased to 8/22 patients (36.3%) post-Rezūm™ (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this single-institution, prospective, and observational study, water vapor thermal therapy was found to be effective and safe in restoring successful spontaneous voiding in a cohort of elderly and frail patients.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 17048,Search update 2023-11-13,,

However, it is unknown whether individual memory risk can be predicted. We reanalyzed an epidemiological cohort of older adults to predict memory decline at ≈1 year after revascularization. Methods and Results We studied Health and Retirement Study participants who underwent CABG or percutaneous coronary intervention at age ≥65 years between 1998 and 2015 and participated in ≥1 biennial postprocedure assessment. Using a memory score based on direct and proxy cognitive tests, we identified participants whose actual postprocedure memory score was 1-2 (""mild"") or >2 (""major"") SDs below expected postprocedure performance. We modeled probability of memory decline using logistic regression on preoperatively known factors and evaluated model discrimination and calibration. A total of 1390 participants (551 CABG, 839 percutaneous coronary intervention) underwent CABG/percutaneous coronary intervention at 75±6 years old; 40% were women. The cohort was 83% non-Hispanic White, 8.4% non-Hispanic Black, 6.4% Hispanic ethnicity, and 1.7% from other groups masked by the HRS (Health and Retirement Study) to preserve participant confidentiality. At a median of 1.1 (interquartile range, 0.6-1.6) years after procedure, 267 (19%) had mild memory decline and 88 (6.3%) had major memory decline. Factors predicting memory decline included older age, frailty, and off-pump CABG; obesity was protective. The optimism-corrected area under the receiver operator characteristic curve was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.71-0.77). A cutoff of 50% probability of memory decline identified 14% of the cohort as high risk, and was 94% specific and 30% sensitive for late memory decline.

We conducted a pilot study of the incidence of preoperative and postoperative (intraoperative or postoperative) covert strokes, and explored the relationship of postoperative ischaemic brain injury to blood levels of neurofilament light, a biomarker of neuronal damage. Methods: We analysed 101 preoperative (within 2 weeks of surgery) and 58 postoperative research MRIs on postoperative days 2–9 from two prospective cohorts collected at the University of Wisconsin (NCT01980511 and NCT03124303). Participants were aged >65 yr and undergoing non-intracranial, non-carotid surgery. Results: Preoperative covert stroke was identified in 2/101 participants (2%; Bayesian 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.2–5.4). This rate was statistically different from the postoperative ischaemic brain injury rate of 7/58 (12%, 4.9–21.3%; P=0.01) based on postoperative imaging. However, in a smaller group of participants with paired imaging (n=30), we did not identify the same effect (P=0.67). Patients with postoperative brain injury had elevated peak neurofilament light levels (median [inter-quartile range], 2.34 [2.24–2.64] log10 pg ml−1) compared with those without (1.86 [1.48–2.21] log10 pg ml−1; P=0.025). Delirium severity scores were higher in those with postoperative brain injury (19 [17–21]) compared with those without (7 [4–12]; P=0.01). Conclusion: Although limited by a small sample size, these data suggest that preoperative covert stroke occurs more commonly than previously anticipated.

As frailty is a relatively novel concept, its clinical significance for POD has seldom been examined. This study aimed to investigate the association between frailty and POD in aged cancer patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery in Taiwan. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 345 consecutive patients aged ≥65 years with newly diagnosed cancer who underwent elective abdominal surgery between 2016 and 2018. Frailty assessment was performed using the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA). POD was assessed daily using the Confusion Assessment Method from postoperative day 1 until discharge. Patients were allocated into fit and frail groups. RESULTS: POD occurred in 19 (5.5%) of 345 patients. POD incidence was 1.6%, 3.1%, 4.8%, 11.5%, and 10.0% in patients with 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4+ frail conditions, respectively, which presented a positive linear correlation among patients with an increased number of frail conditions and POD incidence. Based on CGA, 159 (46.1%) and 186 (53.9%) patients were allocated to fit and frail groups, respectively. POD incidence was 2.5% and 8.1% for the fit and frail groups, respectively. Frailty status was an independent risk factor for POD occurrence in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Our study identified frailty as an independent risk factor for POD in aged Taiwanese cancer patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery. Given the high prevalence of frailty among older cancer patients, preoperative assessment is important to identify high risk of POD and to improve the quality of postoperative care.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16822,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Neuropsychological assessment is the gold standard for diagnosis, but the resources required for routine use are significant. Instead, it is common for simplified and unvalidated tests to be used for trials and in clinical practice. We undertook a single-centre prospective observational study in elective surgical patients aged ≥ 65 years recruited between September 2019 and January 2021. Patients underwent neuropsychological assessment, the Modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status and Montreal Cognitive Assessment before surgery. Tests were repeated at approximately four to eight postoperative weeks. We included 105 patients and 28 (27%) were lost to follow-up. Pre-operative Modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status and cognitive domain scores were very weakly to moderately correlated (r = 0.09-0.41). Pre-operative Montreal Cognitive Assessment and cognitive domain scores were very weakly to weakly correlated (r = 0.17-0.37) Postoperative Modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status and cognitive domain scores were very weakly to weakly correlated (r = 0.09-0.36). Postoperative Montreal Cognitive Assessment score and cognitive domain scores were very weakly to weakly correlated (r = 0.07-0.36). Overall, there was limited agreement between tests. We conclude that the Modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status and Montreal Cognitive Assessment should not be used in isolation to diagnose postoperative neurocognitive disorders. There seems to be little to no pre-operative, postoperative or pre- to postoperative correlation between these tests and the neuropsychological assessment in older adults without pre-operative cognitive impairment.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 17026,Search update 2023-11-13,,

There is a direct relationship between the increase in age and the prevalence of both functional and cognitive disabling chronic diseases, however, little we know about whether age is an independent factor in predicting worse functional outcomes and readmissions after TKR. The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical-functional results and unplanned readmissions within the first 90 postoperative days in patients older than 80 years compared with a control group of patients younger than 80 years. METHODS: From our institutional patient database, 450 patients who underwent TKR between 2016 and 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients had the medical assurance of Hospital Italiano (Plan de Salud), for which none of these was lost on the follow-up nor were treated in another hospital. Patients were divided in two groups: Group A with 186 patients over 80 years and a control group B with 264 patients between 70 and 80 years. The fragility of these was defined according to the Charlson Comorbidity Index and the Simple Frail Score. Comorbidities were divided in eight groups to define which were the most influential in the final results. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in terms of unplanned readmissions, pain or in functional scores within 90 days between both groups. There was a significant difference in the length of postoperative hospital stay in favor of group A (A: 2.56 SD + - 0.76, B: 4.08 SD =  - 2.23; p = 0.00001). The Charlson score was higher in the group of patients older than 80 years (p = 0.02) as well as the Simple Frail Score (p = 0.004). The ASA score did not show significant differences between both groups. CONCLUSION: Age as an independent factor proved not to be a predictor by itself of unplanned readmissions or worse clinical-functional results in a period of 90 postoperative days between both groups. We believe that the preoperative evaluation of octogenarian patients should be multidisciplinary, with special attention to the identification of comorbidities that can influence the fragility of a patient and the optimization of the pathology.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 17050,Search update 2023-11-13,,

Even tailored anesthesia procedures in older patients remain a high risk for postoperative cognitive disorder. Additional stress derived from anxiety and anesthesia itself can negatively impact postoperative cognitive outcomes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of general versus regional anesthesia on postoperative cognitive disorder and indicators of perioperative stress in elderly undergoing surgery. Methods: In this single center prospective study between December 2014 and November 2015, 46 patients aged 50 to 85 years undergoing dermatology surgery were enrolled. Patients were stratified by receiving general versus regional nerve anesthesia. On three consecutive days, saliva cortisol levels were analyzed three times per day. Cognitive function was assessed on the day before and the day after surgery using comprehensive neuropsychological testing of multiple cognitive functions including memory, executive function, attention and processing speed. Results: Comparing the regional anesthesia group (RAG, n = 28) with the general anesthesia group (GAG, n = 18) no significant difference in the postoperative cognitive function was observed. However, patients in the GAG had significantly higher postoperative cortisol levels when compared to patients in the RAG. In both groups, a peak of cortisol value was detected on the day of surgery, which was higher in the GAG in comparison to the RAG. Conclusions: We did not observe a difference in postoperative cognitive function between patients undergoing regional or general anesthesia for dermatology surgery. However, we found lower cortisol level in the RAG. Based on these findings, future studies should investigate alternatives to reduce stress in a general anesthesia setting.

As a result, geriatric patients could face an increased nutritional risk. This study aimed to investigate the nutritional and functional status of geriatric patients and their association with postoperative complications. METHODS: Patients who underwent abdominal surgery for digestive cancer in our center between January 2020 and August 2021 were included in the study. Computed tomography scans were collected to evaluate muscle mass and density. Changes in body weight, muscle strength, physical performances, nutritional risk, and status were evaluated upon admission. Postoperative outcomes collected included postoperative length of stay, complications, and 30-d readmission. RESULTS: A total of 1513 patients were included for the analysis. Of these, 72.8% were at risk for malnutrition (70.3% in the non-geriatric group and 75.4% in the geriatric group; P = 0.031), and 28.9% had malnutrition according to the Subjective Global Assessment (26.0% in the non-geriatric group and 31.8% in the geriatric group; P = 0.016). Compared with younger patients, geriatric patients have decreased muscle mass (skeletal muscle index, 44.8 versus 47.4; P < 0.001) and skeletal muscle density. Significant weight loss and loss of skeletal muscle occurred concurrently in 18.8% of the patients and were more frequent in the geriatric group (22.3% versus 14.7%; P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, an age of 65 y or older (odds ratio [OR], 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.86; P = 0.014), a serum albumin level ≤4.11 g/dL (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.03-1.77; P = 0.03), skeletal muscle loss (OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.28-2.24; P < 0.001), declined functional status (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.14-1.98; P = 0.004), systematic inflammation (OR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.09-2.8; P = 0.026), and significant weight loss (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.06-2.85; P = 0.017) were independent predictors of overall postoperative complications. Although there was a trend of interactions between advanced age, skeletal muscle loss, and significant weight loss, multivariate analysis showed none of the interactions were significantly predictive of overall postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: Geriatric patients are at greater risk for malnutrition. Their declined nutritional and functional status together with advanced age could increase the risk for postoperative complications. Nutrition evaluation should be part of the preoperative workup, and timely interventions should be initiated if needed, especially in geriatric patients.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 17022,Search update 2023-11-13,,

METHODS: We enrolled patients who underwent short-segment fusion surgery for lumbar degenerative disease from May 2018 to June 2020. All patients were assessed for depression using the ZDRS. Patients were included in the depression group and not-depressed group based on their scores. Preoperative baseline data were collected on characteristics, comorbidities, laboratory data, pain levels (visual analogue scale [VAS]), functional status (Oswestry Disability Index [ODI]), and surgery-related variables. The primary outcomes were PRO measures, including VAS, ODI and satisfaction two years after lumbar fusion surgery. Other outcomes included postoperative complications, the length of stay, and reoperation. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the risk factors for poor satisfaction.

Depressed group had higher rates of choices for dissatisfaction (36.7% vs. 14.0%, p = 0.015), higher VAS scores of low back pain (2.8 ± 2.3 vs. 1.6 ± 1.7, p = 0.012), and worse functional status (31.5 ± 22.5 vs 21.8 ± 19.9, p = 0.015) than the not-depressed group. Depressed patients reported significantly higher rates of postoperative complications and readmissions. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that depression (p = 0.001) was independently associated with postoperative dissatisfaction. CONCLUSION: Preoperative depression was a risk factor for postoperative dissatisfaction, worse functional status, readmission, and complications in older patients undergoing lumbar fusion surgery. Preoperative screening using the Zung depression scale helps inform decision-making when considering fusion surgery for patients aged 75 and older.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 17046,Search update 2023-11-13,,

BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium is common among elderly surgical patients and is associated with longer hospitalization and significant morbidity. Some evidence suggest that baseline cognitive impairment is an important risk factor. Routine screening for both preoperative cognitive impairment and postoperative delirium is recommended for older surgical patients. As of 2019, we implemented such routine perioperative screening in all elective surgical patients ≥70 years. METHODS: Retrospective single-center analysis of prospectively collected data between January and December 2020. All elective noncardiac surgical patients ≥70 years without pre-existing dementia were included. Postoperative delirium, defined as 4A's test score ≥4, was evaluated in the postanesthesia care unit and during the initial 2 postoperative days. Patients' electronic records were also reviewed for delirium symptoms and other adverse outcomes. RESULTS: Of 1518 eligible patients, 1338 (88%) were screened preoperatively [mean (SD) age 77 (6) years], of whom 21% (n=279) had cognitive impairment (Mini-Cog score ≤2). Postoperative delirium occurred in 15% (199/1338). Patients with cognitive impairment had more postoperative delirium [30% vs. 11%, adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 3.3 (2.3-4.7)]. They also had a higher incidence of a composite of postoperative complications [20% vs. 12%, adjusted odds ratio: 1.8 (1.2-2.5)], and median 1-day longer hospital stay [median (interquartile range): 6 (3,12) vs. 5 (3,9) days]. CONCLUSIONS: One-fifth of elective surgical patients ≥70 years present to surgery with preoperative cognitive impairment. These patients are at increased risk of postoperative delirium and major adverse outcomes.",duplicate of 16758,Search update 2023-11-13,,

J., Oh, S. K., Lim, B. G., Kim, Y. S., Lee, D. Y., Lee, J. H.",Effect of surgical pleth index-guided remifentanil administration on perioperative outcomes in elderly patients: a prospective randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: During general anesthesia, the surgical pleth index (SPI) monitors nociception. The evidence of SPI in the elderly remains scarce. We aimed to investigate whether there is a difference in perioperative outcomes following intraoperative opioid administration according to the surgical pleth index (SPI) value versus hemodynamic parameters (heart rate or blood pressure) in elderly patients. METHODS: Patients aged 65-90 years who underwent laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery under sevoflurane/remifentanil anesthesia were randomized to receive remifentanil guided by SPI (SPI group) or conventional clinical judgment based on hemodynamic parameters (conventional group). The primary endpoint was intraoperative remifentanil consumption. Secondary endpoints were intraoperative hemodynamic instability, pain score, fentanyl consumption and delirium in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), and perioperative changes in interleukin-6 and natural killer (NK) cell activity. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients (38, SPI; 37, conventional) were included in the study. The SPI group consumed significantly more remifentanil intraoperatively than the conventional group (mean ± SD, 0.13 ± 0.05 vs. 0.06 ± 0.04 μg/kg/min, P < 0.001). Intraoperative hypertension and tachycardia were more common in the conventional group than in the SPI group. Pain score in the PACU (P = 0.013) and the incidence of delirium in the PACU were significantly lower in the SPI group than the conventional group (5.2% vs. 24.3%, P = 0.02). There was no significant difference in NK cell activity and interleukin-6 level. CONCLUSIONS: In the elderly patients, SPI-guided analgesia provided appropriate analgesia with sufficient intraoperative remifentanil consumption, lower incidence of hypertension/ tachycardia events, and a lower incidence of delirium in the PACU than the conventional analgesia. However, SPI-guided analgesia may not prevent perioperative immune system deterioration.

DESIGN: A prospective observational cohort study of patients undergoing cardiac surgery covering the period between April 16, 2018 and January 18, 2022. SETTING: Two academic hospitals in Switzerland. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients (≥60 years of age) who underwent elective cardiac surgery, including coronary artery bypass graft, mitral or aortic valve replacement or repair, and combined procedures. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome measure was the incidence of postoperative delirium (POD) in the intensive or intermediate care unit, diagnosed using the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist. The prediction model contained 4 preoperative risk factors to which the following points were assigned: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score ≤23 received 2 points; MMSE 24-27, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) >4, prior stroke and/or transient ischemic attack (TIA), and abnormal serum albumin (≤3.5 or ≥4.5 g/dL) received 1 point each. The missing data were handled using multiple imputation. In total, 348 patients were included in the study. Sixty patients (17.4%) developed POD. For point levels in the prediction model of 0, 1, 2, and ≥3, the cumulative incidence of POD was 12.6%, 22.8%, 25.8%, and 35%, respectively. The validation resulted in a pooled area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.60 (median CI, 0.525-0.679).

METHODS: A total of 120 patients, aged from 18 to 65 years old, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade I or II, were scheduled to undergo hysteroscopy under total intravenous anesthesia. The patients were divided into 3 groups (n = 40 each): dexamethasone plus saline group (DC group), dexamethasone plus droperidol group (DD group) and dexamethasone plus propofol group (DP group). Dexamethasone 5 mg and flurbiprofen axetil 50 mg were given intravenously before induction of general anesthesia. Anesthesia induction: remimazolam 6 mg/kg/hours was continuously pumped until sleep and slow intravenous injection of alfentanil 20 ug/kg and mivacurium chloride 0.2 mg/kg was given. Anesthesia maintenance: remimazolam 1 mg/kg/hour and alfentanil 40 ug/kg/hours were continuously pumped. After the start of surgery, DC group was given 2 mL saline, DD group was given droperidol 1 mg, and DP group was given propofol 20 mg. Primary outcome: incidence of PONV in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). Secondary outcome: incidence of PONV in patients within 24 hours after surgery, as well as general patient data, duration of anesthesia, the recovery time of patients, dose of remimazolam and alfentanil, etc. RESULTS: In PACU, patients of group DD and DP showed less PONV than those in group DC (P < .05). Within 24 hours after operation, there was no significant difference in the incidence of PONV among the 3 groups (P > .05), but the incidence of vomiting in DD group and DP group was significantly lower than that in DC group (P < .05). There was no significant difference in general data, anesthesia time, the recovery time of patients and dosage of remimazolam and alfentanil among the 3 groups (P > .05). CONCLUSION: The effect of low-dose propofol combined with dexamethasone to prevent PONV under remimazolam-based general anesthesia was similar to that of droperidol combined with dexamethasone, both of which significantly reduced the incidence of PONV in the PACU compared to dexamethasone alone. However, low-dose propofol combined with dexamethasone had little effect on the incidence of PONV within 24 hours compared to dexamethasone alone and only reduced the incidence of postoperative vomiting in patients.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16973,Search update 2023-11-13,,

METHODS: Our retrospective analysis included, in total, 449 consecutive patients who experienced major urological cancer surgery and a preoperative geriatric functional assessment at our institution (development cohort). Geriatric functional assessments included Geriatric 8, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, and mini-cognitive assessment instrument (Mini-Cog). Multivariate analysis was used to identify factors related to POD and combined to create a predictive score. The composite score was externally validated using a cohort of 92 consecutive pancreatic cancer patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy and a preoperative geriatric functional assessment (validation cohort). The predictive accuracy and performance of the composite score were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) and calibration plots. RESULTS: In multivariate analysis of a development cohort, the following factors were significantly associated with POD: a Mini-Cog score of <3 (odds ratio [OR] = 9.5; p < 0.001), disability in the responsibility for medication (OR = 4.1; p = 0.03), and the preoperative use of benzodiazepine (OR = 6.4; p < 0.001). The composite score of these three factors showed excellent discrimination in predicting POD, with AUC values of 0.819 and 0.804 in development and validation cohorts, respectively.

We performed preoperative comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) for older patients with esophageal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 217 patients over 75 years old who underwent esophagectomy for thoracic esophageal cancer were analyzed. The CGA was performed preoperatively and included the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Geriatric Depression Score (GDS), vitality index, Barthel index, and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). We defined the robust group as patients with normal function on every instrument, and the pre-frail and frail groups as those with functional impairment on one instrument or two or more instruments, respectively. We assessed how the CGA correlated with postoperative complications and prognosis. RESULTS: Of the 217 patients, 86 (39.6%) were in the robust group, 68 (31.3%) in the pre-frail group, and 63 (29.0%) in the frail group. Postoperative pneumonia (P = 0.026) and anastomotic leakage (P = 0.032) were significantly more common in the frail group.

However, incidence and risk factors associated with POD after shoulder arthroplasty (SA) have not been well studied using a large-scale national database. METHODS: A retrospective database analysis was performed based on the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 2005 to 2014, the largest fully paid hospital care database in the United States. Patients undergoing SA were included. The patient's demographics, comorbidities, length of stay (LOS), total costs, type of insurance, type of hospital, in-hospital mortality, and medical and surgical perioperative complications were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 115,147 SA patients were obtained from the NIS database. The general incidence of delirium after SA was 0.89%, peaking in 2010. Patients with delirium after SA had more comorbidities, prolonged LOS, increased hospitalization costs, and higher in-hospital mortality (P < 0.0001). These patients were associated with medical complications during hospitalization, including acute renal failure, acute myocardial infarction, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, stroke, urinary tract infection, sepsis, continuous invasive mechanical ventilation, blood transfusion, and overall perioperative complications. Risk factors associated with POD include advanced age, neurological disease, depression, psychosis, fluid and electrolyte disturbances, and renal failure. Protective factors include elective hospital admissions and private insurance. CONCLUSION: The incidence of delirium after SA is relatively low. Delirium after SA was associated with increased comorbidities, LOS, overall costs, Medicare coverage, mortality, and perioperative complications. Studying risk factors for POD can help ensure appropriate management and mitigate its consequences. Meanwhile, we found some limitations of this type of research and the need to establish a country-based POD database, including further clearly defining the diagnostic criteria for POD, investigating risk factors and continuing to collect data after discharge (30 days or more), so as to further improve patient preoperative optimization and management.",[mass quarantine] duplicate of 16995,Search update 2023-11-13,,

In 2017, the Federal Joint Committee (Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss) introduced a 'quality contract' (QC) as a new instrument to improve healthcare in Germany. One of the four areas for improvement of in-patient care is the 'Prevention of POD in the care of elderly patients' (QC-POD), as a means to reduce the risk of developing POD and its complications. The Institute for Quality Assurance and Transparency in Health Care identified gaps in the in-patient care of elderly patients related to the prevention, screening and treatment of POD, as required by consensus-based and evidence-based delirium guidelines. This paper introduces the QC-POD protocol, which aims to implement these guidelines into the clinical routine. There is an urgent need for well-structured, standardised and interdisciplinary pathways that enable the reliable screening and treatment of POD. Along with effective preventive measures, these concepts have a considerable potential to improve the care of elderly patients. Methods and analysis The QC-POD study is a non-randomised, pre-post, monocentric, prospective trial with an interventional concept following a baseline control period. The QC-POD trial was initiated on 1 April 2020 between Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin and the German health insurance company BARMER and will end on 30 June 2023. Inclusion criteria: patients 70 years of age or older that are scheduled for a surgical procedure requiring anaesthesia and insurance with the QC partner (BARMER). Exclusion criteria included patients with a language barrier, moribund patients and those unwilling or unable to provide informed consent. The QC-POD protocol provides perioperative intervention at least two times per day, with delirium screening and non-pharmacological preventive measures. Ethics and dissemination This protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the Charité-Universitätsmedizin, Berlin, Germany (EA1/054/20). The results will be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal and presented at national and international conferences.

BACKGROUND: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction is a common complication after orthopaedic surgery that results in poor prognosis and increases the length of hospital stays and costs. Dexmedetomidine has been confirmed as a drug that can improve postoperative cognitive dysfunction in some studies. However, to date, the specific mechanism by which dexmedetomidine improves postoperative cognitive dysfunction is still elusive. METHODS/DESIGN: A single-centre, prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial will be conducted at Hebei General Hospital. Ninety-six elderly patients who undergo total hip or knee replacement will be studied in this trial and randomly divided into two groups. Patients in the experimental group will receive a loading dose of 0.5 μg/kg dexmedetomidine for 10 min and then a maintenance dose of 0.5 μg/kg/h dexmedetomidine until 30 min before the end of the operation, and patients in the control group will be infused with an equal volume of normal saline. The incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction will be the primary outcome. Changes in the balance of T helper 17 cell and regulatory T cell; the levels of matrix metalloproteinase 9, S-100β, IL-17A, and IL-10; perioperative complications; hospitalization duration; and intraoperative blood loss will be the secondary outcomes. DISCUSSION: The consequences of this trial will show that dexmedetomidine can improve postoperative cognitive dysfunction in elderly orthopaedic patients, which may be related to the balance of T helper 17/regulatory T cells.

However, the relationship between blood transfusion and POD has been heatedly debated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the risk factors of POD and the relationship between blood transfusions and the occurrence of POD in hip fracture surgery through big data analysis. Methods: Medical data (including medication history, clinical and laboratory findings, and perioperative variables) were acquired from the clinical data warehouse (CDW) of the five hospitals of Hallym University Medical Center and were compared between patients without POD and with POD. Results: The occurrence of POD was 18.7% (228 of 2398 patients). The risk factors of POD included old age (OR 4.38, 95% CI 2.77–6.91; p < 0.001), American Society of Anesthesiology physical status > 2 (OR 1.84 95% CI 1.4–2.42; p < 0.001), dementia (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.53–2.6; p < 0.001), steroid (OR 0.53 95% CI 0.34–0.82; p < 0.001), Antihistamine (OR 1.53 95% CI 1.19–1.96; p < 0.001), and postoperative erythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/h) (OR 0.97 95% CI 0.97–0.98; p < 0.001) in multivariate logistic regression analysis. The postoperative transfusion (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.88–3.41; p < 0.001) had a significant effect on the incidence of POD. Conclusions: big data analytics using a CDW was a good option to identify the risk factors of POD and to prevent POD in hip fracture surgery.",excluded study,,"Level 1, Title abstract screening; Level 2, Full text screening ; Level 3, Study Characteristics",Lee2023ClinMed.pdf
