# Draft Systematic Review Protocol

## Background

Between 2019 and 2060, the number of US adults aged 65 years or older will likely increase from 54 to 95 million; the oldest-old (85+ years) will grow from 6.6 to 19 million over the same period.^1,2^ These demographic shifts carry significant implications for the practice of anesthesiology. In 2007, the elderly (15% of the US population) underwent 35% of inpatient surgeries.^3^ In 2006, 32% of outpatient surgeries were performed in the elderly.^4^ Moreover, the risk of postoperative complications increases with age.^5,6^ Improving the quality of perioperative care for older adults is a major priority for patients, providers, and policy makers.

## Systematic Review Questions

1.  Among older patients anticipating surgery and anesthesia, does expanded preoperative evaluation (eg, for frailty, cognitive impairment, functional status, or psychosocial issues) lead to improved postoperative outcomes?

2.  Among older patients undergoing surgery, does regional anesthesia as the primary anesthetic technique improve postoperative outcomes compared with general anesthesia?

3.  Among older patients undergoing surgery with general anesthesia, does the use of intravenous agents for maintenance of anesthesia improve postoperative outcomes compared with inhaled agents?

4.  Among older patients undergoing surgery and anesthesia, do commonly used potentially inappropriate medications administered during the perioperative period increase the risk of postoperative delirium or other adverse outcomes?

5.  Among older patients undergoing surgery and anesthesia, do dexmedetomidine, ketamine, ramelteon, or melatonin administered during the perioperative period decrease the risk of postoperative delirium or other adverse cognitive outcomes?

## Analytic Framework

![](assets/geriatricsAnalyticFramework.png){width="9in"}

## Methods

### Search

The literature search will include publications from 2000 to present (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Central).

### Study inclusion/exclusion criteria

1.  Studies of older patients. (Studies including younger patients will be considered if a result is judged transportable to the target population).

2.  Publication Types

    -   Published journal articles, reports 

    -   Language restrictions: English language only

    -   Limited to humans

    -   Grey literature

3.  Study Designs

    -   Include

        -   Randomized clinical trials

        -   Non-randomized trials

        -   Quasi-randomized designs (eg, before-after studies, interrupted time series)

        -   Cohort studies (prospective, retrospective)

        -   Case-control studies

        -   Other observational studies (eg, diagnostic accuracy)

    -   Exclude

        -   Case reports and case series

        -   Surveys, questionnaires

        -   Letters

        -   Editorials

        -   Conference abstracts

        -   Systematic reviews and meta-analyses (for reference checking)

### Search Strategies

(Separate document)

### Data Abstraction and Management

Title/abstract and full-text screening together with data extraction will be performed on the DistillerSR platform.^7^ All screening will be conducted in duplicate, with disagreements resolved by consensus or a third reviewer as needed.

Anticipated data extraction includes study characteristics (eg, design, dates, setting, centers, country, funding, registration, subgroups, surgery, and anesthetic), study arms (eg, intervention, participant characteristics, intervention, and outcomes reported), and outcome detail according to type (eg, patient-reported or clinical; continuous, dichotomous \[includes relative effects\], rating scales \[Likert, visual analog, numeric\]). As required, figures will be digitized. A single reviewer will extract study data followed by verification.^8^

### Risk of Bias of Individual Studies

Risk of bias assessment for randomized trials will be conducted using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. ^9^ Risk of bias assessment of non-randomized studies of interventions (eg, observational studies of interventions including cohort, case-control, and quasi-randomized designs) will utilize the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies of Interventions tool (ROBINS-I).^10^ Risk of bias will be assessed independently by two reviewers with discrepancies resolved by discussion, or a third reviewer as needed.

### Evidence Synthesis

As appropriate, based on clinical and methodological heterogeneity, study results will be pooled in either pairwise or network meta-analyses in random effects models (given the goal of estimating unconditional effects not relevant only to the pooled studies).^11^ Statistical heterogeneity is evaluated using between study variance and *I*^2^.^12^ When there is meaningful heterogeneity and the number of studies sufficient (eg, 10 or more) meta-regression is considered to explain the variability.^13^ With 10 or more pooled studies, small study effects and the potential for publication bias will be examined in funnel plots, regression-based tests, adjustment methods, and p-curves.^14,15^

Relative effects will be pooled as risk ratios for clinical interpretability except when adjusted measures reported as odds are pooled. Continuous measures are pooled as mean differences or standardized mean differences when studies use differing scales. When practicably, standardized mean differences will be re-expressed on the most meaningful scale.^16^ R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) will be used for analyses and data made publicly available when the guideline is completed.

### Grading the Strength of Evidence

The strength (certainty) of evidence for important outcomes will be appraised using either GRADE^17^ and ACCF/AHA^18^ frameworks.

### Registration

TBD
