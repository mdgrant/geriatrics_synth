Subgroup analysis by age shows patients >=65 experience less cognitive decline when receiving dexamethasone (RR, 95% CI: 0.22, 0.05-0.94), while no difference is detected among patients <65 (RR, 95% CI: 0.59, 0.26-1.36).\nNA\n    Glumac 2021\n169\nInclude: Age 41-84 yrs.Exclude: Cerebrovascular incidence 3 years prior; mental illness; visual, hearing, or motor impairment; hx of cardiac or carotid surgery; adrenal gland disease; alcohol or drug abuse; MMSE < 26; Beck Depression score > 19; perioperative stroke.\nPostoperative cognitive decline 6 days after surgery (RR 0.510; 95% CI: 0.24 to 1.079, p=0.067) and 4 year after study conducted was lower in dexamethasone group compared to placebo (RR 0.456; 95% CI: 0.192 to 1.100, p=0.068).\nNA\n    Hakim 2012\n101\nInclude: Age > 65 yrs.Exclude: Hx of neuropsychiatric disorders, alcoholism; intake of psychotropic mediations.\nIncidence of postoperative delirium was lower in the risperidone group compared to placebo (13.7% vs 34%, p=0.031) when given post-operatively.\nNA\n    Hollinger 2021\n200\nInclude: Aged ≥65 years and scheduled for visceral, orthopaedic, vascular, gynaecological, cardiac, or thoracic surgery.Exclude: Delirium at admission; MMSE score < 24; DOS >= 3; dementia; known ICU admission; haloperidol or ketamine intolerance; communication issues; QT interval prolongation; Parkinson's disease; epilepsy; body weight > 100 kg; intake of dopaminergic drugs.\nDelirium was seen in 6.4% of patients in the ketamine group, 11.1% with haloperidol, and 9.1 % with placebo (p=0.16).\nBaden PRIDe Trial was an investigator-initiated, phase IV, two-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial. The purpose of this study was to identify within a cohort of ICU patients admitted for severe illness those who are at risk of death in the year following the discharge from ICU.

Delirium severity (Delirium Rating Scale mean difference, 4.0 [95% CI: 2.0-5.8]) and delirium duration (mean difference in days, 6.4 [95% CI: 4.0-8.0]) were lower in the haloperidol group compared with the placebo group.\nNA\n    Larsen 2010\n495\nInclude: Age <65 with with a history of post op delirium; age>=65, elective TKR or THR.Exclude: Diagnosis of dementia; active alcohol use; history of alcohol abuse; allergy olanzapine; current use of antipsychotic.\nThe incidence of delirium was significantly lower in the olanzapine group than in the placebo group (14.3% vs 40.2%, Adjusted OR:0.2, CI: 0.1-0.4, p<0.001). However, delirium lasted longer in the olanzapine group (2.2 [SD\u00031.3] versus 1.6 [SD\u00030.7] days; p=0.02).
