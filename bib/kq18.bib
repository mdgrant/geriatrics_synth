	abstract = {OBJECTIVE Geriatric patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery have unique needs due to the physiological changes of aging. They are at risk for adverse outcomes such as delirium, infection, and iatrogenic complications, and these complications, in turn, contribute to the risk of functional decline, nursing home admission, and death. Whether preoperative and perioperative comanagement by a geriatrician reduces the incidence of in-hospital complications and length of in-hospital stay after elective lumbar spine surgery remains unknown. METHODS A unique model of comanagement for elderly patients undergoing lumbar fusion surgery was implemented at a major academic medical center. The Perioperative Optimization of Senior Health (POSH) program was launched with the aim of improving outcomes in elderly patients (> 65 years old) undergoing complex lumbar spine surgery. In this model, a geriatrician evaluates elderly patients preoperatively, in addition to performing routine preoperative anesthesia surgical screening, and comanages them daily throughout the course of their hospital stay to manage medical comorbid conditions and coordinate multidisciplinary rehabilitation along with the neurosurgical team. The first 100 cases were retrospectively reviewed after initiation of the POSH protocol and compared with the immediately preceding 25 cases to assess the incidence of perioperative complications and clinical outcomes. RESULTS One hundred twenty-five patients undergoing lumbar decompression and fusion were enrolled in this pilot program. Baseline characteristics were similar between both cohorts. The mean length of in-hospital stay was 30{\%} shorter in the POSH cohort (6.13 vs 8.72 days; p = 0.06). The mean duration of time between surgery and patient mobilization was significantly shorter in the POSH cohort compared with the non-POSH cohort (1.57 days vs 2.77 days; p = 0.02), and the number of steps ambulated on day of discharge was 2-fold higher in the POSH cohort (p = 0.04). Compared with the non-POSH cohort, the majority of patients in the POSH cohort were discharged to home (24{\%} vs 54{\%}; p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Geriatric comanagement reduces the incidence of postoperative complications, shortens the duration of in-hospital stay, and contributes to improved perioperative functional status in elderly patients undergoing elective spinal surgery for the correction of adult degenerative scoliosis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate implementation of an innovative intervention designed to prevent complications and stimulate early rehabilitation among frail elderly inpatients. METHODS: The program was implemented in April 2011. A mixed-methods process evaluation and before-after study were performed. Primary effect outcomes included incidence of hospital-acquired delirium, cognitive decline, and decline in activities of daily living (ADL) during hospital stay. Secondary endpoints included ADL performance 3 months postdischarge, readmission, and caregiver burden. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-one preintervention and 195 postintervention patients aged 70 years or older were included. Overall, no significant differences in primary endpoints were found. Mean ADL between discharge and follow-up improved (3.2 vs 5.7, P = .058). Caregivers rated burden of care lower at 3 months postdischarge (.5 vs -.6, P = .049). CONCLUSIONS: The CareWell in Hospital program was implemented satisfactorily. Although the low baseline delirium incidence (11{\%}), higher comorbidity, and an increasing learning curve during a restricted implementation period potentially influenced the overall effects, this integrated care program may have beneficial effects on outcomes among frail elderly surgical patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is an evident need for improved management of elderly patients with trauma in order to avoid common and troublesome complications such as delirium. The aim of this study was to investigate whether an implementation of a multi-factorial program including intensified pre-hospital and perioperative treatment and care could reduce the incidence of delirium in elderly patients with hip fracture, cognitively intact at admission to the hospital. In addition, we explored the factors that characterize patients who developed delirium. METHODS: A prospective, quasi-experimental design was used. A total of 263 patients with hip fracture (> or = 65 years), cognitively intact at admission, were consecutively included between April 2003 and April 2004. On 1 October 2003, a new program was introduced. All patients were screened for cognitive impairment within 30 min after admission to the emergency department using The Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ). To screen for delirium, patients were tested within 4 h of admission and thereafter daily, using the Organic Brain Syndrome scale. RESULTS: The number of patients who developed delirium during hospitalization was 74 (28.1{\%}), with a decrease from 34{\%} (45 of 132) in the control group to 22{\%} (29 of 131) in the intervention group (P=0.031). Patients who developed delirium were statistically older, more often had > 4 prescribed drugs at admission and scored less well in the SPMSQ test. CONCLUSION: The use of a multi-factorial intervention program in elderly hip fracture patients, lucid at admission, reduced the incidence of delirium during hospitalization by 35{\%}.},

@article{2108,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of introducing and embedding a structured geriatric liaison service, Proactive care of Older People undergoing Surgery (POPS)-Urology, using comprehensive geriatric assessment methodology, on an inpatient urology ward. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A phased quality improvement project was undertaken using stepwise interventions. Phase 1 was a before-and-after study with initiation of a daily board round, weekly multidisciplinary meeting, and targeted geriatrician-led ward rounds for elective and emergency urology patients aged ≥65 years admitted over two 1-month periods. Outcomes were recorded from medical records and discharge documentation, including length of inpatient stay, medical and surgical complications, and 30-day readmission and mortality rates. Phase 2 was a quality improvement project involving Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles and qualitative staff surveys in order to create a Geriatric Surgical Checklist (GSCL) to standardize the intervention in Phase 1, improve equity of care by extending it to all ages, improve team-working and streamline handovers for multidisciplinary staff. RESULTS: Phase 1 included 112 patients in the control month and 130 in the intervention month. The length of inpatient stay was reduced by 19{\%} (mean 4.9 vs 4.0 days; P = 0.01), total postoperative complications were lower (risk ratio 0.24 {$[$}95{\%} confidence interval 0.10, 0.54{$]$}; P = 0.001). A non-significant trend was seen towards fewer cancellations of surgery (10 vs 5{\%}; P = 0.12) and 30-day readmissions (8 vs 3{\%}; P = 0.07). In Phase 2, the GSCL was created and incrementally improved. Questionnaires repeated at intervals showed that the GSCL helped staff to understand their role better in multidisciplinary meetings, improved their confidence to raise issues, reduced duplication of handovers and standardized identification of geriatric issues. Equity of care was improved by providing the intervention to patients of all ages, despite which the time taken for the daily board round did not lengthen. CONCLUSION: This is the first known paper describing the benefits of daily proactive geriatric intervention in elective and emergency urological surgery. The results suggest that using a multidisciplinary team board round helps to facilitate collaborative working between surgical and geriatric medicine teams. The GSCL enables systematic identification of patients who require a focused comprehensive geriatric assessment. There is potential to transfer the GSCL package to other surgical specialties and hospitals to improve postoperative outcomes.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of an inpatient geriatric consultation team (IGCT) on end points of interest in people with hip fracture: length of stay, functional status, mortality, new nursing home admission, and hospital readmission. DESIGN: Controlled trial based on assignment by convenience. SETTING: Trauma ward in a university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred seventy-one people with hip fracture aged 65 and older. INTERVENTION: Participants were assigned to a multidisciplinary geriatric intervention (n=94) or usual care (n=77) during hospitalization after hip fracture. MEASUREMENTS: End points were functional status, length of stay, mortality, new nursing home admission, and hospital readmission 6 weeks, 4 months, and 12 months after surgery. RESULTS: Mean length of stay was 11.1 $\pm$5.1 days in the intervention group and 12.4 $\pm$8.5 days in the control groups (P=.24). Complete adherence to IGCT recommendations was 56.8{\%}. A significant benefit of intervention on functional status in univariate analyses (P=.02) 8 days after surgery disappeared in a linear mixed model. Participants with dementia had better functional status in a linear mixed model than those without (P=.03), but this effect was no longer significant after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. After 6 weeks, 4 months, and 12 months, no between-group differences could be documented for mortality, new nursing home admission, or readmission rate. CONCLUSION: This trial could not document functional benefits of an IGCT intervention in people with hip fracture. More research is needed to investigate whether a more-intensive approach with more-direct control over patient management, more-specific recommendations, and more-intense education would be effective.},

@article{2736,
	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: The need for integrating palliative care into surgical services has been established within the surgical literature. The ability to effectively screen, obtain an appropriately timed consultation, and determine the effect of consultation remains problematic. OBJECTIVE: To examine surgical palliative care consultations over time and their relationship to the initiation and implementation of a systemwide frailty-screening program. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We reviewed all surgical palliative care consultations performed between January 1, 2006, and August 31, 2013, and abstracted the referring service (medicine/surgery), date of surgery (if any), date of death (if any), and all variables required to calculate a frailty score using the risk analysis index. We examined changes in mortality and referral patterns before and after implementation of the frailty-screening program using multivariable logistic regression. EXPOSURES: Surgical palliative care consultations, including frailty screening. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary study outcomes were 30-, 180-, and 360-day mortality. RESULTS: From 2006 to 2013, a total of 310 palliative care consultations were ordered for surgical patients: 160 before initiation of frailty screening (January 1, 2011) and 150 after initiation of the program. The groups had similar demographics, comorbidities, and frailty scores. After initiation, we observed dramatically decreased mortality at 30, 180, and 360 days (21.3{\%} vs 31.9{\%}, 44.0{\%} vs 70.6{\%}, and 66.0{\%} vs 78.8{\%}, respectively; all P < .05). This coincided with an increased rate of palliative care consultations from 32 per year to 56 per year. After initiation of the program, consultations were more likely to be requested by surgeons (56.7{\%} vs 24.4{\%}; P < .05) and were more likely to occur before the index operation (52.0{\%} vs 26.3{\%}; P < .05). Implementation of the screening program was associated with a 33{\%} reduction in 180-day mortality (odds ratio {$[$}OR{$]$}, 0.37; 95{\%} CI, 0.22-0.62; P < .001) even after controlling for age, frailty, and whether the patients had surgery. Modeled mortality was also reduced when the palliative care consultation was ordered by a surgeon (OR, 0.50; CI, 0.30-0.83; P = .007) or ordered before the operation (OR, 0.52; CI, 0.30-0.90; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our data suggest that a systematic frailty-screening program effectively identifies at-risk surgical patients and is associated with a significant reduction in mortality for patients undergoing palliative care consultation. Analysis also suggests that preoperative palliative care consultations ordered by surgeons are associated with reduced mortality rates.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of geriatric comanagement on clinical outcomes of older patients undergoing surgery for gastrointestinal cancer. DESIGN: This was a single-center, nonrandomized, before-and-after study, which compared patient outcomes before and after the implementation of geriatric comanagement in an oncological surgery division. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The study included patients aged 70 or older, who were treated for a gastrointestinal cancer at the Oncological Surgery Division of the Policlinico San Martino Hospital (Genoa, Italy). Patients from the control group were treated between January 2015 and October 2018, and the patients who received geriatric comanagement during their stay in the surgical ward were treated between November 2018 and December 2019. METHODS: Patients from both groups received a preoperative comprehensive geriatric assessment in the preoperative phase and were followed according to the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery model in the perioperative period. In the geriatric comanagement group, targeted interventions during daily geriatrician-led ward rounds were performed. Inverse probability weighting was used to adjust estimates for potential baseline confounders. RESULTS: A total of 207 patients were included: 107 in the control group and 90 who received geriatric comanagement. Overall, patients from both groups had similar demographic and clinical characteristics with a median {$[$}interquartile range (IQR){$]$} age of 80.0 (77.0, 84.0) years and a pre-frail phenotype {$[$}median (IQR) 40-item Frailty Index 0.15 (0.10, 0.26){$]$}. In the geriatric comanagement group, a significant reduction in grade I-V complications (adjusted odds ratio 0.29; 95{\%} CI 0.21-0.40); P {$<$} .001) and in 1-year readmissions (adjusted hazard ratio 0.53; 95{\%} CI 0.28-0.98; P {$<$} .044) was observed. No difference between the 2 groups in terms of 1-year mortality was detected. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our study supports the implementation of geriatric comanagement in the care of older patients undergoing surgery for gastrointestinal cancer.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: As the US population ages, the number of operations performed on elderly patients will likely increase. Frailty predicts postoperative mortality and morbidity more than age alone, thus presenting opportunities to identify the highest-risk surgical patients and improve their outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of the Frailty Screening Initiative (FSI) on mortality and complications by comparing the surgical outcomes of a cohort of surgical patients treated before and after implementation of the FSI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This single-site, facility-wide, prospective cohort quality improvement project studied all 9153 patients from a level 1b Veterans Affairs medical center who presented for major, elective, noncardiac surgery from October 1, 2007, to July 1, 2014. INTERVENTIONS: Assessment of preoperative frailty in all patients scheduled for elective surgery began in July 2011. Frailty was assessed with the Risk Analysis Index (RAI), and the records of all frail patients (RAI score, ≥21) were flagged for administrative review by the chief of surgery (or designee) before the scheduled operation. On the basis of this review, clinicians from surgery, anesthesia, critical care, and palliative care were notified of the patient's frailty and associated surgical risks; if indicated, perioperative plans were modified based on team input. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Postoperative mortality at 30, 180, and 365 days. RESULTS: From October 1, 2007, to July 1, 2014, a total of 9153 patients underwent surgery (mean {$[$}SD{$]$} age, 60.3 {$[$}13.5{$]$} years; female, 653 {$[$}7.1{\%}{$]$}; and white, 7096 {$[$}79.8{\%}{$]$}). Overall 30-day mortality decreased from 1.6{\%} (84 of 5275 patients) to 0.7{\%} (26 of 3878 patients, P < .001) after FSI implementation. Improvement was greatest among frail patients (12.2{\%} {$[$}24 of 197 patients{$]$} to 3.8{\%} {$[$}16 of 424 patients{$]$}, P < .001), although mortality rates also decreased among the robust patients (1.2{\%} {$[$}60 of 5078 patients{$]$} to 0.3{\%} {$[$}10 of 3454 patients{$]$}, P < .001). The magnitude of improvement among frail patients increased at 180 (23.9{\%} {$[$}47 of 197 patients{$]$} to 7.7{\%} {$[$}30 of 389 patients{$]$}, P < .001) and 365 days (34.5{\%} {$[$}68 of 197 patients{$]$} to 11.7{\%} {$[$}36 of 309 patients{$]$}, P < .001). Multivariable models revealed improved survival after FSI implementation, controlling for age, frailty, and predicted mortality (adjusted odds ratio for 180-day survival, 2.87; 95{\%} CI, 1.98-4.16). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Implementation of the FSI was associated with reduced mortality, suggesting the feasibility of widespread screening of patients preoperatively to identify frailty and the efficacy of system-level initiatives aimed at improving their surgical outcomes. Additional investigation is required to establish a causal connection.},

	abstract = {Background: Older people undergoing elective surgery have significant post-operative problems prolonging hospitalisation. Objective: To design, embed, and evaluate an evidence-based comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) service for at-risk older patients undergoing elective surgery. Setting: Urban teaching hospital. Subjects: elective surgical patients aged 65+. Intervention: multidisciplinary preoperative CGA service with post-operative follow-through (proactive care of older people undergoing surgery {$[$}'POPS'{$]$}). Methods: Observational cohort study and multilevel surveys (development and modelling phase). Prospective 'before and after' comparison (exploratory evaluation). Results: Findings from the development phase showed high levels of preoperative co-morbidity, no multidisciplinary preoperative input, and multiple potentially preventable post-operative problems delaying discharge in older elective surgery patients. Comparison of 2 cohorts of elective orthopaedic patients (pre-POPS vs POPS, N = 54) showed the POPS group had fewer post-operative medical complications including pneumonia (20{\%} vs 4{\%} {$[$}p = 0.008{$]$}) and delirium (19{\%} vs 6{\%} {$[$}p = 0.036{$]$}), and significant improvements in areas reflecting multidisciplinary practice including pressure sores (19{\%} vs 4{\%} {$[$}p = 0.028{$]$}), poor pain control (30{\%} vs 2{\%} {$[$}p < 0.001{$]$}), delayed mobilisation (28{\%} vs 9{\%} {$[$}p = 0.012{$]$}) and inappropriate catheter use (20{\%} vs 7{\%} {$[$}p = 0.046{$]$}). Length of stay was reduced by 4.5 days. There were fewer delayed discharges relating to medical complications (37{\%} vs 13{\%}) or waits for OT assessment or equipment (20{\%} vs 4{\%}). Conclusion: A proactive evidence-based CGA service for at-risk older elective surgical patients was developed according to MRC framework for complex interventions. Pre/post comparison in elective orthopaedic patients showed improved (within methodological limitations) post-operative outcomes indicative of better clinical effectiveness and efficiency, and contributed to the service obtaining mainstream funding. Informed by the present study, a randomised controlled trial is ongoing. {\copyright}2007 Oxford University Press.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delirium is a serious and common postoperative complication, especially in frail elderly patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a geriatric liaison intervention in comparison with standard care on the incidence of postoperative delirium in frail elderly cancer patients treated with an elective surgical procedure for a solid tumour. METHODS: Patients over 65 years of age who were undergoing elective surgery for a solid tumour were recruited to a multicentre, prospective, randomized, controlled trial. The patients were randomized to standard treatment versus a geriatric liaison intervention. The intervention consisted of a preoperative geriatric consultation, an individual treatment plan targeted at risk factors for delirium, daily visits by a geriatric nurse during the hospital stay and advice on managing any problems encountered. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative delirium. The secondary outcome measures were the severity of delirium, length of hospital stay, complications, mortality, care dependency, quality of life, return to an independent preoperative living situation and additional care at home. RESULTS: In total, the data of 260 patients were analysed. Delirium occurred in 31 patients (11.9{\%}), and there was no significant difference between the incidence of delirium in the intervention group and the usual-care group (9.4{\%} vs. 14.3{\%}, OR: 0.63, 95{\%} CI: 0.29-1.35). CONCLUSIONS: Within this study, a geriatric liaison intervention based on frailty for the prevention of postoperative delirium in frail elderly cancer patients undergoing elective surgery for a solid tumour has not proven to be effective.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the long term effects after discharge of a hospital-based geriatric liaison intervention to prevent postoperative delirium in frail elderly cancer patients treated with an elective surgical procedure for a solid tumour. In addition, the effect of a postoperative delirium on long term outcomes was examined. METHODS: A three month follow-up was performed in participants of the Liaison Intervention in Frail Elderly study, a multicentre, prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Patients were randomized to standard treatment or a geriatric liaison intervention. The intervention consisted of a preoperative geriatric consultation, an individual treatment plan targeted at risk factors for delirium and daily visits by a geriatric nurse during the hospital stay. The long term outcomes included: mortality, rehospitalisation, Activities of Daily Living (ADL) functioning, return to the independent pre-operative living situation, use of supportive care, cognitive functioning and health related quality of life. RESULTS: Data of 260 patients (intervention n = 127, Control n = 133) were analysed. There were no differences between the intervention group and usual-care group for any of the outcomes three months after discharge. The presence of postoperative delirium was associated with: an increased risk of decline in ADL functioning (OR: 2.65, 95{\%} CI: 1.02-6.88), an increased use of supportive assistance (OR: 2.45, 95{\%} CI: 1.02-5.87) and a decreased chance to return to the independent preoperative living situation (OR: 0.18, 95{\%} CI: 0.07-0.49). CONCLUSIONS: A hospital-based geriatric liaison intervention for the prevention of postoperative delirium in frail elderly cancer patients undergoing elective surgery for a solid tumour did not improve outcomes 3 months after discharge from hospital. The negative effect of a postoperative delirium on late outcome was confirmed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Nederlands Trial Register, Trial ID NTR 823.},

	abstract = {AIMS: Elderly patients with colorectal carcinoma are screened with the Identification of Seniors at Risk (ISAR) questionnaire to identify frail patients. These patients are more at risk for mortality and morbidity and are referred to the geriatric specialist for assessment (Dutch acronym: DOG). The DOG assessment aims to preoperatively optimize the patient in order to improve postoperative outcomes. This study evaluates if the DOG assessment influences postoperative outcome after colorectal surgery. METHODS: Retrospective cohort and match-control study. Elderly patients who underwent elective resection between 01-01-2008 and 01-08-2013 in the Medical Centre Alkmaar were included. Patients with a positive ISAR score were referred to the geriatric specialists for DOG assessment (DOG patients). DOG assessment encompassed comprehensive geriatric assessment and interventions. PRIMARY OUTCOMES: Mortality, delirium and length of hospital stay. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: postoperative complications. COHORT COMPARISON: Cohort ISAR- (2008-2010, no ISAR questionnaire) is compared with cohort ISAR+ (2011-2013, ISAR questionnaire). Match-control comparison: DOG patients are compared with matched controls from cohort ISAR-. RESULTS: Compared to their matched controls, DOG patients were older and had a higher prevalence of certain risk factors for postoperative delirium. In both comparisons, no statistical significant differences were found between the groups in mortality and postoperative delirium. Length of stay was significantly shorter in cohort ISAR+. CONCLUSIONS: While the DOG patients were significantly more at risk for postoperative complications, the DOG patients had comparable postoperative outcomes as their matched controls. We therefore conclude that the DOG assessment has a positive influence on the postoperative outcomes after colorectal surgery.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES/BACKGROUND: The Geriatric Surgery Verification (GSV) Program promotes clinical standards aimed to optimize the quality of surgical care delivered to older adults. The purpose of this study was to determine if preliminary implementation of the GSV Program standards improves surgical outcomes. DESIGN: Prospective study with cohort matching. SETTING: Data from a single institution compared with a national data set cohort. PARTICIPANTS: All patients aged ≥75 years undergoing inpatient operations between January 2018 and December 2019 were included. Cohort matching by age and procedure code was performed using a national data set. MEASUREMENTS: Baseline pre- and intraoperative characteristics prospectively recorded using Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP) variable definitions. Postoperative outcomes were recorded including complications as defined by VASQIP, 30-day mortality, and length of stay. RESULTS: A total of 162 patients participated in the GSV program, and 308 patients comprised the matched comparison group. There was no difference in postoperative occurrence of one or more complications (p = 0.81) or 30-day mortality (p = 0.61). Patients cared for by the GSV Program had a reduced postoperative length of stay (median 4 days {$[$}range 1,31{$]$} vs. 5 days {$[$}range 1,86{$]$}; p < 0.01; and mean 5.4 $\pm$4.8 vs. 8.8 $\pm$11.8 days; p < 0.01) compared with the matched cohort. In a multivariable regression model, the GSV Program's reduced length of stay was independent of other associated covariates including age, operative time, and comorbidities (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Preliminary implementation of the GSV Program standards reduces length of stay in older adults undergoing inpatient operations. This finding demonstrates both the clinical and financial value of the GSV Program.},

	abstract = {As the population ages, more older adults will undergo surgical procedures, and common physiologic changes can raise the risk for surgical complications while increasing morbidity and mortality. In conjunction with the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, we piloted a comprehensive and interdisciplinary assessment and intervention protocol for perioperative care for patients aged >/=75 years undergoing elective general, gynecology-oncologic, and orthopedic surgery. The intervention included screening tools for cognitive, functional, and nutritional deficits, a Geriatric Nurse Champion on each inpatient surgical unit, and an interdisciplinary Geriatric Surgery Quality Committee. Our intervention group was compared to surgical patients during the same time period 1 year prior to the intervention, and the groups were well matched in demographics and comorbidities. The intervention group had significantly higher rates of advance care plan documentation in analysis of all patients (P < .001) and in subgroup analysis of those 85 and older (P = .006). The preintervention group had less postoperative delirium compared to the postintervention group but it was not significant and there was no difference in length of stay between groups. Various explanations for the minimal impact of the protocol exist: small sample size, presence of other hospital initiatives to reduce pressure ulcer and delirium, and clinician's awareness of project planning that led to incorporating ideas prior to official implementation. Future research implementing this protocol in naive and/or underperforming institutions may demonstrate a greater effect. Larger sample size as well as implementation in other surgical fields may reveal a significant impact. However, if additional study does not reveal a meaningful impact of a comprehensive geriatric assessment for surgical patients, then consideration must be made regarding unrecognized factors in surgical care for older adults or perhaps that factors cannot be mitigated in older adults because they are intrinsically a higher surgical risk.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Delirium (or acute confusional state) affects 35{\%} to 65{\%} of patients after hip-fracture repair, and has been independently associated with poor functional recovery. We performed a randomized trial in an orthopedic surgery service at an academic hospital to determine whether proactive geriatrics consultation can reduce delirium after hip fracture. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, blinded. SETTING: Inpatient academic tertiary medical center. PARTICIPANTS: 126 consenting patients 65 and older (mean age 79 +/- 8 years, 79{\%} women) admitted emergently for surgical repair of hip fracture. MEASUREMENTS: Detailed assessment through interviews with patients and designated proxies and review of medical records was performed at enrollment to ascertain prefracture status. Subjects were then randomized to proactive geriatrics consultation, which began preoperatively or within 24 hours of surgery, or "usual care." A geriatrician made daily visits for the duration of the hospitalization and made targeted recommendations based on a structured protocol. To ascertain study outcomes, all subjects underwent daily, blinded interviews for the duration of their hospitalization, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Delirium Symptom Interview (DSI), and the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS). Delirium was diagnosed using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) algorithm. RESULTS: The 62 patients randomized to geriatrics consultation were not significantly different (P>.1) from the 64 usual-care patients in terms of age, gender, prefracture dementia, comorbidity, type of hip fracture, or type of surgical repair. Sixty-one percent of geriatrics consultation patients were seen preoperatively and all were seen within 24 hours postoperatively. A mean of 10 recommendations were made throughout the duration of the hospitalization, with 77{\%} adherence by the orthopedics team. Delirium occurred in 20 /62 (32{\%}) intervention patients, versus 32 / 64 (50{\%}) usual-care patients (P =.04), representing a relative risk of 0.64 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI) = 0.37-0.98) for the consultation group. One case of delirium was prevented for every 5.6 patients in the geriatrics consultation group. There was an even greater reduction in cases of severe delirium, occurring in 7/ 60 (12{\%}) of intervention patients and 18 / 62 (29{\%}) of usual-care patients, with a relative risk of 0.40 (95{\%} CI = 0.18-0.89). Despite this reduction in delirium, length of stay did not significantly differ between intervention and usual-care groups (median +/- interquartile range = 5 +/- 2 days in both groups), likely because protocols and pathways predetermined length of stay. In subgroup analyses, geriatrics consultation was most effective in reducing delirium in patients without prefracture dementia or activities of daily living (ADL) functional impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Proactive geriatrics consultation was successfully implemented with good adherence after hip-fracture repair. Geriatrics consultation reduced delirium by over one-third, and reduced severe delirium by over one-half. Our trial provides strong preliminary evidence that proactive geriatrics consultation may play an important role in the acute hospital management of hip-fracture patients.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Older adults undergoing elective surgery experience higher rates of preventable postoperative complications than younger patients. OBJECTIVE: To assess clinical outcomes for older adults undergoing elective abdominal surgery via a collaborative intervention by surgery, geriatrics, and anesthesia focused on perioperative health optimization. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Perioperative Optimization of Senior Health (POSH) is a quality improvement initiative with prospective data collection. Participants in an existing geriatrics-based clinic within a single-site academic health center were included if they were at high risk for complications (ie, older than 85 years or older than 65 years with cognitive impairment, recent weight loss, multimorbidity, or polypharmacy) undergoing elective abdominal surgery. Outcomes were compared with a control group of patients older than 65 years who underwent similar surgeries by the same group of general surgeons immediately before implementation of POSH. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes included length of stay, 7- and 30-day readmissions, and level of care at discharge. Secondary outcomes were delirium and other major postoperative complications. Outcomes data were derived from institutional databases linked with electronic health records and billing data sets. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-three POSH patients were compared with 143 patients in the control group. On average, patients in the POSH group were older compared with those in the control group (75.6 vs 71.9 years; P < .001; 95{\%} CI, 2.27 to 5.19) and had more chronic conditions (10.6 vs 8.5; P = .001; 95{\%} CI, 0.86 to 3.35). Median length of stay was shorter among POSH patients (4 days vs 6 days; P < .001; 95{\%} CI, -1.06 to -4.21). Patients in the POSH group had lower readmission rates at 7 days (5 of 180 {$[$}2.8{\%}{$]$} vs 14 of 142 {$[$}9.9{\%}{$]$}; P = .007; 95{\%} CI, 0.09 to 0.74) and 30 days (14 of 180 {$[$}7.8{\%}{$]$} vs 26 of 142 {$[$}18.3{\%}{$]$}; P = .004; 95{\%} CI, 0.19 to 0.75) and were more likely to be discharged home with self-care (114 of 183 {$[$}62.3{\%}{$]$} vs 73 of 143 {$[$}51.1{\%}{$]$}; P = .04; 95{\%} CI, 1.02 to 2.47). Patients in the POSH group experienced fewer mean number of complications (0.9 vs 1.4; P < .001; 95{\%} CI, -0.13 to -0.89) despite higher rates of documented delirium (52 of 183 {$[$}28.4{\%}{$]$} vs 8 of 143 {$[$}5.6{\%}{$]$}; P < .001; 95{\%} CI, 3.06 to 14.65). A greater proportion of POSH patients underwent laparoscopic procedures (92 of 183 {$[$}50{\%}{$]$} vs 55 of 143 {$[$}38.5{\%}{$]$}; P = .001; 95{\%} CI, 1.04 to 2.52). Tests for interactions between POSH patients and procedure type were insignificant for all outcomes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Despite higher mean age and morbidity burden, older adults who participated in an interdisciplinary perioperative care intervention had fewer complications, shorter hospitalizations, more frequent discharge to home, and fewer readmissions than a comparison group.},

@article{16601,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A common approach to decrease length of stay has been to standardize patient care, for example, by implementing clinical care pathways or creating fast-track organizations. In a recent national report, it was found that Sweden's healthcare system often fails to anticipate and respond to patients as individuals with particular needs, values and preferences. We compared a standardized care approach to one of person-centred care for patients undergoing total hip replacement surgery. METHODS: A control group (n =138) was consecutively recruited between 20th September 2010 and 1st March 2011 and an intervention group (n =128) between 12th December 2011 and 12th November 2012, both scheduled for total hip replacement. The primary outcome measures were length of stay and physical function at both discharge and 3 months later. RESULTS: The mean length of stay in the control group was 7 days (SD 5.0) compared to 5.3 days in the intervention group (SD 2.2). Physical functional performance, as assessed using activities of daily living, was similar at baseline for both groups. At discharge, 84{\%} in the control group had regained activities of daily living level A vs. 72{\%} in the intervention group. At 3 months after surgery, 88{\%} in the control group had regained their independence vs. 92.5{\%} in the person-centred care group. CONCLUSIONS: Focusing attention on patients as people and including them as partners in healthcare decision-making can result in shorter length of stay. The present study shows that the patients should be the focus and they should be involved as partners.},

@article{555,
	abstract = {AIM: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is prevalent in the older population, and surgery is the mainstay of curative treatment. A preoperative geriatric assessment (GA) can identify frail older patients at risk for developing postoperative complications. In this randomized controlled trial we wanted to investigate whether tailored interventions based on a preoperative GA could reduce the frequency of postoperative complications in frail patients operated on for CRC. METHOD: Patients > 65 years scheduled for elective CRC surgery and fulfilling predefined criteria for frailty were randomized to either a preoperative GA followed by a tailored intervention or care as usual. The primary end-point was Clavien-Dindo Grade II-V postoperative complications. Secondary end-points included complications of any grade, reoperation, length of stay, readmission and survival. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-two patients with a mean age of 78.6 years were randomized. We found no statistically significant differences between the intervention group and the control group for Grade II-V complications (68{\%} vs 75{\%}, P = 0.43), reoperation (19{\%} vs 11{\%}, P = 0.24), length of stay (8 days in both groups), readmission (16{\%} vs 6{\%}, P = 0.12) or 30-day survival (4{\%} vs 5{\%}, P = 0.79). Grade I-V complications occurred in 76{\%} of patients in the intervention group compared with 87{\%} in the control group (P = 0.10). In secondary analyses adjusting for prespecified prognostic factors, there was a statistically significant difference in favour of the intervention for reducing the total number of Grade I-V complications (P = 0.05). CONCLUSION: A preoperative GA and tailored interventions did not reduce the rate of Grade II-V complications, reoperations, readmission or mortality in frail older patients electively operated on for CRC.},

	abstract = {Background: For older patients undergoing cardiac surgery, geriatric factors are known to increase postoperative complications and prolong length of stay (LOS). Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is an evidence-based method for geriatric evaluation to develop an individualized-care plan to optimize physical, functional, and social issues. This study analyzed the association between preoperative CGA and hospital LOS after combined cardiac surgery. Methods: This retrospective monocentric study included all patients aged 75 years and greater who underwent combined cardiac surgery between 2014 and 2017. Hospital LOS, intensive care unit LOS, and postoperative complications were compared between patients with or without preoperative CGA before and after propensity-score matching. Results: Mean age of the 407 patients was 79.6 years; 114 underwent a preoperative CGA (28{\%}). For 305 patients (74.9{\%}), coronary artery bypass was associated with aortic valve replacement. After propensity-score matching, a significant difference was found between the 2 groups (preoperative CGA versus none) for in-hospital LOS (12 versus 13 days; P = .04) and intensive care unit LOS (3 versus 4 days; P = .01). In multivariable analysis, a significant association remained between hospital LOS and CGA (P = .02), renal function (P = .02), mitral replacement (P = .001), and complications (P = .001). Conclusions: Our results favor the use of systematic preoperative CGA. These encouraging results need to be validated by prospective studies that assess the impact of individualized-care plan established after CGA on postoperative outcomes. With an aging population, efforts are required to determine how to implement preoperative individualized-care plans to improve postoperative outcomes for vulnerable patients undergoing cardiac surgery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increasing numbers of older patients are undergoing vascular surgery. Inadequate preoperative assessment and optimization may contribute to increased postoperative morbidity and mortality. METHODS: Patients aged at least 65 years scheduled for elective aortic aneurysm repair or lower-limb arterial surgery were enrolled in an RCT of standard preoperative assessment or preoperative comprehensive geriatric assessment and optimization. Randomization was stratified by sex and surgical site (aorta/lower limb). Primary outcome was length of hospital stay. Secondary outcome measures included new medical co-morbidities, postoperative medical or surgical complications, discharge to a higher level of dependency and 30-day readmission rate. RESULTS: A total of 176 patients were included in the final analysis (control 91, intervention 85). Geometric mean length of stay was 5.53 days in the control group and 3.32 days in the intervention group (ratio of geometric means 0.60, 95 per cent c.i. 0.46 to 0.79; P < 0.001). There was a lower incidence of delirium (11 versus 24 per cent; P = 0.018), cardiac complications (8 versus 27 per cent; P = 0.001) and bladder/bowel complications (33 versus 55 per cent; P = 0.003) in the intervention group compared with the control group. Patients in the intervention group were less likely to require discharge to a higher level of dependency (4 of 85 versus 12 of 91; P = 0.051). CONCLUSION: In this study of patients aged 65 years or older undergoing vascular surgery, preoperative comprehensive geriatric assessment was associated with a shorter length of hospital stay. Patients undergoing assessment and optimization had a lower incidence of complications and were less likely to be discharged to a higher level of dependency.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most patients with hip fractures are characterised by older age (>70 years), frailty, and functional deterioration, and their long-term outcomes are poor with increased costs. We compared the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of giving these patients comprehensive geriatric care in a dedicated geriatric ward versus the usual orthopaedic care. METHODS: We did a prospective, single-centre, randomised, parallel-group, controlled trial. Between April 18, 2008, and Dec 30, 2010, we randomly assigned home-dwelling patients with hip-fractures aged 70 years or older who were able to walk 10 m before their fracture, to either comprehensive geriatric care or orthopaedic care in the emergency department, to achieve the required sample of 400 patients. Randomisation was achieved via a web-based, computer-generated, block method with unknown block sizes. The primary outcome, analysed by intention to treat, was mobility measured with the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) 4 months after surgery for the fracture. The type of treatment was not concealed from the patients or staff delivering the care, and assessors were only partly masked to the treatment during follow-up. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00667914. FINDINGS: We assessed 1077 patients for eligibility, and excluded 680, mainly for not meeting the inclusion criteria such as living in a nursing home or being aged less than 70 years. Of the remaining patients, we randomly assigned 198 to comprehensive geriatric care and 199 to orthopaedic care. At 4 months, 174 patients remained in the comprehensive geriatric care group and 170 in the orthopaedic care group; the main reason for dropout was death. Mean SPPB scores at 4 months were 5·12 (SE 0·20) for comprehensive geriatric care and 4·38 (SE 0·20) for orthopaedic care (between-group difference 0·74, 95{\%} CI 0·18-1·30, p=0·010). INTERPRETATION: Immediate admission of patients aged 70 years or more with a hip fracture to comprehensive geriatric care in a dedicated ward improved mobility at 4 months, compared with the usual orthopaedic care. The results suggest that the treatment of older patients with hip fractures should be organised as orthogeriatric care.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine whether knowledge of deficits obtained in a preoperative geriatric assessment may benefit postoperative health outcomes in older women undergoing pelvic surgery. METHODS: This study employed a pre-post intervention cohort design. Primary outcome was difference in scores of the Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 Health Survey in 62 older women who had undergone "usual" compared with an "enhanced" preoperative assessment consisting of Activities of Daily Living, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, Get Up and Go Test, Draw a Clock Test, Mini Nutritional Assessment, Geriatric Depression Scale, and Social Support Scale. The assessment results were placed on the participant's hospital chart. Repeated measures analysis was used. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in Mental Component Summary scores between the usual and enhanced assessment cohorts preoperatively (mean +/- standard deviation; 49.14 +/- 10.61 compared with 53.2 +/- 9.33), at 6 weeks (53.69 +/- 8.61 compared with 55.47 +/- 9.46), or at 6 months postoperatively (53.85 +/- 10.77 compared with 56.25 +/- 7.25); P = .120 for group effect and P = .798 for group by time interaction. Significant time effect was noted (P = .036). There was no significant difference in Physical Component Summary scores between the usual and enhanced assessment cohorts with respect to group effect (P = .986); there was a significant time effect (P = < .001) and a significant group by time interaction (P = .026). Satisfaction with treatment was high in both cohorts at 6 weeks and 6 months. CONCLUSION: A preoperative geriatric assessment did not seem to have differential benefit in healthy older women undergoing elective pelvic floor surgery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II-2.},

	abstract = {Fast-track surgery is a multimodal evidence-based approach to perioperative care aimed at reducing complications and recovery time. We compared a fast-track protocol to standard care in the setting of a small Italian general hospital. Propensity score estimation before and after the study was performed to compare pre-fast-track (pre-FT; January 2013--March 2014) and fast-track (FT; January 2016--December 2016) patients undergoing elective hip and knee replacement surgery with a three-year follow-up (up to January 2020). The primary endpoints were the mean hemoglobin drop, mean predischarge hemoglobin, transfusion and reinfusion rates, pain, ambulation day, hospital length of stay (LOS), and discharge to home/outpatient care or rehabilitation hospital center. The secondary endpoints were the adherence measures to the FT protocol, namely, tourniquet and surgical times, use of drains and catheters, type of anesthesia administered, and complications within three years. The risk difference (RD) and the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) were calculated for each outcome. After the propensity score estimation, we analyzed 59 patients in the pre-FT and 122 in the FT categories. The FT patients, with respect to the pre-FT patients, ameliorated their mean hemoglobin drop from 3.7 to 3.1 g/dl (p < 0.01) and improved their predischarge mean hemoglobin (10.5 g/dL versus 11.0 g/dL; p = 0.01). Furthermore, the aOR of being transfused was reduced by 81{\%} (p < 0,01); the RD of being reinfused was reduced by 63{\%} (p < 0.01); the aOR of having low pain on the first day was increased by more than six times (p < 0.01); the RD of ambulating the first day increased by 91{\%} (p < 0.01); the aOR of admission to a rehabilitation hospital center was reduced by 98{\%} (p < 0.01); the aOR of home discharge increased by 42 times (p < 0.01); the median LOS, tourniquet and surgical times, and use of catheters and drains significantly decreased. Patients with complications at 1 month were 43.1{\%} and 38.2{\%}, respectively, of pre-FT and FT patients (p = 0.63). Complications at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months were significantly lower for the FT patients. This study showed that the uptake of enhanced recovery practices was successful and resulted in the improvement of clinical and organizational outcomes. The fast-track concept and related programs may optimize perioperative care and streamline surgical and rehabilitation care paths.},

	abstract = {Background. Little is known about the effects of interventions for elderly patients with hip fracture in Asian countries, particularly beyond the short term.Methods. Outcomes (service utilization, clinical outcomes, self-care ability, and depressive symptoms) were assessed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after discharge. Self-care ability (ability to perform activities of daily living {$[$}ADLs{$]$}), was measured by the Chinese Barthel Index. Depressive symptoms were measured by the Chinese Geriatric Depression Scale, short form.Results. The experimental group (n = 80) had a significantly better ADL trajectory than the control group (n = 82) during the 1st year after discharge (p =.002). More participants in the experimental group than in the control group recovered their previous walking ability both at 6 months (81{\%} vs 58{\%}, respectively) and 12 months (84{\%} vs 66{\%}, respectively) after discharge. Overall, the odds ratio for the experimental group recovering their previous walking ability was 2.72 (p {$<$}.001) compared to the control group. The experimental group had significantly fewer depressive symptoms than the control group during the 1st year following discharge (p =.004).Conclusion. An interdisciplinary intervention for hip fracture with a discharge support component benefited elderly persons with hip fracture by improving both self-care ability and walking ability, and by decreasing depressive symptoms during the 1st year after hospital discharge.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate an interdisciplinary intervention program for older people with hip fracture in Taiwan. Design: Randomized experimental design. Setting: A 3,800-bed medical center in northern Taiwan. Participants: Elderly patients with hip fracture (N=137) were randomly assigned to an experimental (n=68) or control (n=69) group. Intervention: An interdisciplinary program of geriatric consultation, continuous rehabilitation, and discharge planning. Measurements: Demographic and outcome variables were measured. Outcome variables included service utilization, clinical outcomes, self-care abilities, health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) outcomes, and depressive symptoms. Results: Subjects in the experimental group improved significantly more than those in the control group in the following outcomes: ratio of hip flexion 1 month after discharge (P=.02), recovery of previous walking ability at 1 month (P=.04) and 3 months (P=.001) after discharge, and activities of daily living at 1 month (P=.01) and 2 months (P=.001) after discharge. Three months after discharge, the experimental group showed significant improvement in peak force of the fractured limb's quadriceps (P=.04) and the following health outcomes: bodily pain (P=.03), vitality (P<.001), mental health (P=.02), physical function (P< .001), and role physical (P=.006). They also had fewer depressive symptoms (P=.008) 3 months after discharge. Conclusion: This intervention program may benefit older people with hip fractures in Taiwan by improving their clinical outcomes, self-care abilities, and HRQOL and by decreasing depressive symptoms within 3 months after discharge.},

	abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the influence of preoperative multidisciplinary team (MDT) care on perioperative management and outcomes of frail patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Background: Frail patients are at increased risk for complications and poor functional outcome after cardiac surgery. In these patients, preoperative MDT care may improve outcomes. Methods: Between 2018 and 2021, 1168 patients aged 70 years or older were scheduled for cardiac surgery, of whom 98 (8.4{\%}) frail patients were referred for MDT care. The MDT discussed surgical risk, prehabilitation, and alternative treatment. Outcomes of MDT patients were compared with 183 frail patients (non-MDT group) from a historical study cohort (2015-2017). Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to minimize bias from nonrandom allocation of MDT versus non-MDT care. Outcomes were severe postoperative complications, total days in hospital after 120 days, disability, and health-related quality of life after 120 days. Results: This study included 281 patients (98 MDT and 183 non-MDT patients). Of the MDT patients, 67 (68{\%}) had open surgery, 21 (21{\%}) underwent minimally invasive procedures, and 10 (10{\%}) received conservative treatment. In the non-MDT group, all patients had open surgery. Fourteen (14{\%}) MDT patients experienced a severe complication versus 42 (23{\%}) non-MDT patients (adjusted relative risk, 0.76; 95{\%} CI, 0.51-0.99). Adjusted total days in hospital after 120 days was 8 days (interquartile range, 3-12 days) versus 11 days (interquartile range, 7-16 days) for MDT and non-MDT patients, respectively (P = .01). There was no difference in disability or health-related quality of life. Conclusions: Preoperative MDT care for frail patients undergoing cardiac surgery is associated with alterations in surgical management and with a lower risk for severe complications.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We implemented a multidisciplinary pre- and rehabilitation program for elderly patients (≥75 years of age) in a single center consisting of prehabilitation, laparoscopic surgery and early rehabilitation with the intention to lower 1-year overall mortality. METHODS: In this study we compared all patients that underwent elective surgery for stage I-III colorectal cancer before and during development and after implementation of the program (2010-2011, 2012-2013 and 2014-2015). Primary endpoint was 1-year overall mortality, the secondary endpoint was 30-day postoperative outcome. RESULTS: Eighty-six consecutive patients were included in the study cohort and compared to 63 patients from 2010 to 2011 and 75 patients from 2012 to 2013. Patient characteristics were comparable; median age in the study cohort was 80.6. Seventy-three patients (85{\%}) participated in the program, 54 (63{\%}) of whom followed a prehabilitation program, 46 (53{\%}) of whom were discharged to a rehabilitation center. Laparoscopic surgery increased over the years from 70{\%} to 83{\%} in the study cohort. There was a trend in lower 1-year overall mortality: 11{\%} versus 3{\%} (p=0.08). There was a significant reduction in cardiac complications and the number of patients with a prolonged length of stay (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Multidisciplinary care for elderly colorectal cancer patients that includes prehabilitation and rehabilitation is feasible and may contribute to lower complications and reduced length of stay. This study did not show a clear benefit of implementing a comprehensive care program including both prehabilitation and rehabilitation. Dedicated multidisciplinary care seems the key attributer to favorable outcomes of CRC surgery in elderly patients.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Frailty and comorbidities increase the risk of postoperative complications and raise treatment costs. Perioperative optimisation is shown to improve surgical outcomes for the elderly. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of introducing a multidisciplinary preoperative clinic for older patients (Colchester Older Persons' Evaluation for Surgery (COPES) clinic) undergoing major colorectal surgery. METHODS: This 5-year single centre study included patients >65 years with ≥3 comorbidities undergoing major colorectal surgery. From October 2018, patients with these characteristics were evaluated and optimised in the COPES clinic by a geriatrician and an anaesthetist. Outcomes were compared to high-risk patients operated on prior to COPES (pre-COPES group). The primary outcomes were postoperative morbidity at discharge and 6 months measured by the Comprehensive Complication Index. Patients were matched on age and number of comorbidities. RESULTS: A total of 54 patients were enrolled in the pre-COPES and 18 in the COPES group. After matching, the results were comparable for both groups. The length of stay was shorter in the COPES group and the recurrence rate was higher; however, it did not reach statistical significance in both findings. CONCLUSION: This clinic intends to improve treatment quality, placing emphasis on shared decision-making. More focus should be put on patient-reported outcomes and experiences. Especially for elderly patients, quality of life and maintaining independence are often their priority. To determine the true value of a preoperative multidisciplinary clinic targeting elderly comorbid patients, a prospective study with larger cohort is needed, focusing not only on objective outcomes but also on patient-reported outcomes.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) has shown to benefit older patients undergoing urological and orthopedic surgery. However, this approach has been scarcely assessed in patients elected for colorectal surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort of patients aged >/=70 years admitted for elective colorectal cancer surgery to a single hospital between 2008 and 2012. Upon admission, patients were assigned to a usual care (UC) plan or a CGA-based care (GS) plan conducted by a multidisciplinary team, according to standard clinical criteria.Analyzed outcomes included the incidence of delirium and other geriatric syndromes during hospital stay, mortality, readmissions, andnumber of perioperative complications. RESULTS: The cohort included 310 patients, 203 assigned to the GS group and 107 to the UC group. Patients in the GS group had significantly lower Barthel and Lawton scores, higher prevalence of dementia and heart failure, and higher comorbidity burden. Fifty-four (17.5{\%}) patientsexperienced delirium (23 {$[$}11.3{\%}{$]$} and 31 {$[$}29.2{\%}{$]$} in the GS and UC groups, respectively; p < .001), and 49 (15.8{\%}) patient experienced other geriatric syndromes (21 {$[$}10.3{\%}{$]$} and 28 {$[$}26.2{\%}{$]$} in the GS and UC groups, respectively; p < .001). Serious complications were more frequent in the GS group: 154 (75.9{\%}) vs 60 (56.1{\%}) in the UC group; p < .001. No significant differences were observed between groups regarding readmissions, and in-hospital and post-discharge (1 year follow-up) mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the poorer clinical condition of patients in the GS group, the CGA-based intervention resulted in a lower incidence of delirium and other geriatric syndromes compared with the UC group.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether an early multidisciplinary geriatric intervention in elderly patients with hip fracture reduced length of stay, morbidity, and mortality and improved functional evolution. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled intervention trial. SETTING: Orthopedic ward in a university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred nineteen patients aged 65 and older hospitalized for hip fracture surgery. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned to a daily multidisciplinary geriatric intervention (n=155) or usual care (n=164) during hospitalization in the acute phase of hip fracture. MEASUREMENTS: Primary endpoints were in-hospital length of stay and incidence of death or major medical complications. Secondary endpoints were the rate of recovery of previous activities of daily living and ambulation ability at 3, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS: Median length of stay was 16 days in the geriatric intervention group and 18 days in the usual care group (P=.06). Patients assigned to the geriatric intervention showed a lower in-hospital mortality (0.6{\%} vs 5.8{\%}, P=.03) and major medical complications rate (45.2{\%} vs 61.7{\%}, P=.003). After adjustment for confounding variables, geriatric intervention was associated with a 45{\%} lower probability of death or major complications (95{\%} confidence interval=7-68{\%}). More patients in the geriatric intervention group achieved a partial recovery at 3 months (57{\%} vs 44{\%}, P=.03), but there were no differences between the groups at 6 and 12 months. CONCLUSION: Early multidisciplinary daily geriatric care reduces in-hospital mortality and medical complications in elderly patients with hip fracture, but there is not a significant effect on length of hospital stay or long-term functional recovery.},

@article{16629,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delirium in patients with hip fractures lead to higher morbidity and mortality. Prevention in high-risk patients by prescribing low dose haloperidol is currently under investigation. METHODS: This prospective cohort surveillance assessed hip fracture patients for risk of developing a delirium with the Risk Model for Delirium (RD) score. High-risk patients (score ≥5 points) were treated with a prophylactic low-dose of haloperidol according to hospital protocol. Primary outcome was delirium incidence. Secondary outcomes were differences between high- and low-risk patients in delirium, length of stay (LOS), return to pre-fracture living situation and mortality. Logistic regression analysis was performed with age, ASA-classification, known dementia, having a partner, type of fracture, institutional residence and psychotropic drug use as possible confounders. RESULTS: 445 hip fracture patients aged 65 years and older were admitted from January 2008 to December 2009. The RD-score was completed in 378 patients, 173 (45.8{\%}) high-risk patients were treated with prophylactic medication. Sensitivity was 71.6{\%}, specificity 63.8{\%} and the negative predictive value (NPV) of a score < 5 was 85.9{\%}.Delirium incidence (27.0{\%}) was not significantly different compared to 2007 (27.8{\%}) 2006 (23.9{\%}) and 2005 (29.0{\%}) prior to implementation of the RD- protocol.Logistic regression analysis showed that high-risk patients did have a significant higher delirium incidence (42.2{\%} vs. 14.1{\%}, OR 4.1, CI 2.43-7.02). They were more likely to be residing at an alternative living situation after 3 months (62.3{\%} vs. 17.0{\%}, OR 6.57, CI 3.23-13.37) and less likely to be discharged from hospital before 10 days (34.9{\%} vs. 55.9{\%}, OR 1.63, CI 1.03-2.59). Significant independent risk factors for a delirium were a RD-score ≥5 (OR 4.13, CI 2.43-7.02), male gender (OR 1.93, CI 0.99-1.07) and age (OR 1.03, CI 0.99-1.07). CONCLUSIONS: Introducing the delirium prevention protocol did not reduce delirium incidence.The RD-score did identify patients with a high risk to develop a delirium. This high-risk group had a longer LOS and returned to pre-fracture living situation less often.The NPV of a score < 5 was high, as it should be for a screening instrument. Concluding, the RD-score is a useful tool to identify patients with poorer outcome.},

@article{1201,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common complication in patients with hip fractures and is associated with an increased risk of subsequent dementia. The aim of this trial was to evaluate the effect of a pre- and postoperative orthogeriatric service on the prevention of delirium and longer-term cognitive decline. METHODS: This was a single-center, prospective, randomized controlled trial in which patients with hip fracture were randomized to treatment in an acute geriatric ward or standard orthopedic ward. Inclusion and randomization took place in the Emergency Department at Oslo University hospital. The key intervention in the acute geriatric ward was Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment including daily interdisciplinary meetings. Primary outcome was cognitive function four months after surgery measured using a composite outcome incorporating the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) and the 10 words learning and recalls tasks from the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease battery (CERAD). Secondary outcomes were pre- and postoperative delirium, delirium severity and duration, mortality and mobility (measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)). Patients were assessed four and twelve months after surgery by evaluators blind to allocation. RESULTS: A total of 329 patients were included. There was no significant difference in cognitive function four months after surgery between patients treated in the acute geriatric and the orthopedic wards (mean 54.7 versus 52.9, 95{\%} confidence interval for the difference -5.9 to 9.5; P = 0.65). There was also no significant difference in delirium rates (49{\%} versus 53{\%}, P = 0.51) or four month mortality (17{\%} versus 15{\%}, P = 0.50) between the intervention and the control group. In a pre-planned sub-group analysis, participants living in their own home at baseline who were randomized to orthogeriatric care had better mobility four months after surgery compared with patients randomized to the orthopedic ward, measured with SPPB (median 6 versus 4, 95{\%} confidence interval for the median difference 0 to 2; P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Pre- and postoperative orthogeriatric care given in an acute geriatric ward was not effective in reducing delirium or long-term cognitive impairment in patients with hip fracture. The intervention had, however, a positive effect on mobility in patients not admitted from nursing homes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01009268 Registered November 5, 2009.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective is to observe the effect of Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) in the perioperative period of hip fracture. METHODS: From October 2018 to October 2021, 155 patients over the age of 65 diagnosed with hip fracture and treated with surgery at the Department of Trauma Orthopaedics of General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University were randomly divided into two groups using a prospective research method. A total of 70 cases in the CGA group received a perioperative comprehensive assessment of the geriatric, and 85 cases in the control group received routine medical consultation. RESULTS: Elderly patients with hip fractures have a high comorbidity index. Patients with abnormal daily activity before injury accounted for 55{\%}, the abnormal rate of nutrition was 58.1{\%}, the abnormal rate of cognition, anxiety, and depression was 81.8{\%}, and 77.3{\%} of the patients were in a weak state. There was no significant difference in age, gender, ASA grade, fracture type, and operation mode between the two groups, but there were significant differences in operation rate at 48 h (χ(2) = 22.153; P ≤0.001), preoperative waiting time (Z = -6.387; P ≤0.001), total hospital stay (Z = -11.756; P ≤0.001), and incidence of postoperative delirium (χ(2) = 23.897; P ≤0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of CGA shortened the preoperative waiting time and total hospital stay, increased the 48 h operation rate, and reduced the incidence of postoperative delirium.},
