	abstract = {PURPOSE: Postoperative delirium (POD) is known to be one of the most critical complications of major operative procedures in elderly patients. Since disorders of the sleep-wake cycle have been reported to be one of the key factors in POD, we attempted to clarify the effectiveness of improving sleep-wake cycle disorders with medication after surgery to prevent POD, by conducting a prospective randomized study of 42 elderly patients who underwent resection of either gastric or colon cancer through an open laparotomy. METHODS: The delirium-free protocol (DFP) group was given an intramuscular injection of diazepam at 20:00 h each night, as well as a continuous intravenous infusion of flunitrazepam and pethidine administered over 8 h, for the first three nights postoperatively. Two patients were excluded because of failure to complete the DFP. RESULTS: The incidence of POD was 7/20 (35.0{\%}) in the non-DFP group and 1/20 (5.0{\%}) in the DFP group, this difference being significant (P = 0.023). Morning lethargy produced by the DFP was observed in 40{\%} of the DFP group; however, no other side effects were seen. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that DFP treatment is effective for controlling POD in elderly patients after general surgery and does not appear to be associated with severe complications or side effects. To our knowledge, this is the first report proposing artificial control of the sleep-awake rhythm by medication as a means of preventing POD in elderly patients.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Postoperative delirium is one of the most common complications after cardiovascular surgery in older adults. Benzodiazepines are a reported risk factor for delirium; however, there are no studies investigating remimazolam, a novel anesthetic agent. Therefore, we prospectively investigated the effect of remimazolam on postoperative delirium. METHODS: We included elective cardiovascular surgery patients aged ≥65 years at Hamamatsu University Hospital between August 2020 and February 2022. Patients who received general anesthesia with remimazolam were compared with those who received other anesthetics (control group). The primary outcome was delirium within 5 days after surgery. Secondary outcomes were delirium during intensive care unit stay and hospitalization, total duration of delirium, subsyndromal delirium, and differences in the Mini-Mental State Examination scores from preoperative to postoperative days 2 and 5. To adjust for differences in the groups' baseline covariates, we used stabilized inverse probability weighting as the primary analysis and propensity score matching as the sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: We enrolled 200 patients; 78 in the remimazolam group and 122 in the control group. After stabilized inverse probability weighting, 30.3{\%} of the remimazolam group patients and 26.6{\%} of the control group patients developed delirium within 5 days (risk difference, 3.8{\%}; 95{\%} confidence interval -11.5{\%} to 19.1{\%}; p = 0.63). The secondary outcomes did not differ significantly between the groups, and the sensitivity analysis results were similar to those for the primary analysis. CONCLUSION: Remimazolam was not significantly associated with postoperative delirium when compared with other anesthetic agents.},

	abstract = {Background: The aim of this clinical study was to evaluate the efficacy of neurobehavioral, hemodynamics and sedative characteristics of dexmedetomidine compared with morphine and midazolam-based regimen after cardiac surgery at equivalent levels of sedation and analgesia in improving clinically relevant outcomes such as delirium. Methods: Sixty patients were randomly allocated into one of two equal groups: group A = 30 patients received dexmedetomidine infusion (0.4-0.7 μg/kg/h) and Group B = 30 patients received morphine in a dose of 10-50 μg/kg/h as an analgesic with midazolam in a dose of 0.05 mg/kg up to 0.2 mg/kg as a sedative repeated as needed. Titration of the study medication infusions was conducted to maintain light sedation (Richmond agitation-sedation scale) (-2 to +1). Primary outcome was the prevalence of delirium measured daily through confusion assessment method for intensive care. Results: Group A was associated with shorter length of mechanical ventilation, significant shorter duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay (P = 0.038), and lower risk of delirium following cardiac surgery compared to Group B. Group A showed statistically significant decrease in heart rate values 4 h after ICU admission (P = 0.015) without significant bradycardia. Group A had lower fentanyl consumption following cardiac surgery compared to Group B. Conclusion: Dexmedetomidine significantly reduced the length of stay in ICU in adult cardiac surgery with no significant reduction in the incidence of postoperative delirium compared to morphine and midazolam.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Preoperative high-dose glucocorticoid (GC) improves postoperative recovery and reduces length of stay but increases the risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Whether preoperative high-dose GC increases the risk of POCD in abdominal wall reconstruction (AWR) is unknown. Material and methods: This was a double-blind randomized controlled trial examining the effect of 125 mg methylprednisolone (MP) iv versus placebo (saline) iv given as a single dose at anesthesia induction. Cognitive function was tested pre- and postoperatively by The Trail Making Test (TMT) A and TMT-B. Outcome of TMT is time (seconds) to complete the test; the longer the time, the worse the impairment. Primary endpoint was individual change preoperative to postoperative day (POD) 1 on TMT-B. Secondary endpoints were individual change preoperative to: POD1 on TMT-A, POD2 on TMT-A and TMT-B, and POD30 on TMT-A and TMT-B, respectively. Results: A total of 33 patients (MP: n = 17; placebo: n = 16) were analyzed for primary endpoint. There was no significant difference between the groups in primary endpoint (MP group median 1s (IQR -7 −23) vs. placebo group median 12s (IQR -5 −34), p = 0.521). The MP group was significantly faster than the placebo group preoperative to POD30 on TMT-A (MP group median −10s (IQR -16 −4) vs. placebo group median -4s (IQR -8 --1), p = 0.046). There were no significant differences in remaining secondary endpoints. Conclusion: Preoperative high-dose GC is not associated with increased risk of early POCD in elective AWR for a large incisional hernia. {\copyright}2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Beers Criteria is an explicit list of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) best avoided in adults ≥65 years of age. Cognitively impaired and frail surgical patients often experience poor outcomes after surgery, but the impacts of PIMs on these patients are unclear. Our objective was to assess whether perioperative PIM administration was associated with poor outcomes in geriatric surgical patients. We then evaluated the association between PIM administration and postoperative outcomes in subgroups of patients who were frail or cognitively impaired. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients ≥65 years of age who underwent elective inpatient surgery at a large academic medical center from February 2018 to January 2020. Edmonton Frail Scale and Mini-Cog screening tools were administered to all patients at their preoperative clinic visit. A Mini-Cog score of 0 to 2 was considered cognitive impairment, and frailty was defined by an Edmonton Frail Scale score of ≥8. Patients were divided into 2 groups depending on whether they received at least 1 PIM (PIM+), based on the 2019 AGS Beers Criteria, in the perioperative period or none (PIM-). We assessed the association of preoperative frailty, cognitive impairment, and perioperative PIM administration with the length of hospital stay and discharge disposition using multiple regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, ASA physical status, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. RESULTS: Of the 1627 included patients (mean age, 73.7 years), 69.3{\%} (n = 1128) received at least 1 PIM. A total of 12.7{\%} of patients were frail, and 11.1{\%} of patients were cognitively impaired; 64{\%} of the frail patients and 58{\%} of the cognitively impaired patients received at least 1 PIM. Perioperative PIM administration was associated with longer hospital stay after surgery (PIM-, 3.56 $\pm$5.2 vs PIM+, 4.93 $\pm$5.66 days; P < .001; 95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$}, 0.360-0.546). Frail patients who received PIMs had an average length of stay (LOS) that was nearly 2 days longer than frail patients who did not receive PIMs (PIM-, 4.48 $\pm$5.04 vs PIM+, 6.33 $\pm$5.89 days; P = .02). Multiple regression analysis revealed no significant association between PIM administration and proportion of patients discharged to a care facility (PIM+, 26.3{\%} vs PIM-, 28.7{\%}; P = .87; 95{\%} CI, -0.046 to 0.054). CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative PIM administration was common in older surgical patients, including cognitively impaired and frail patients. PIM administration was associated with an increased hospital LOS, particularly in frail patients. There was no association found between PIM administration and discharge disposition.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute lung injury (ALI) is the most serious pulmonary complication after lung resection. Although the beneficial effects of low-dose corticosteroids have been demonstrated in patients with postoperative ALI, there are limited data on optimal corticosteroid treatment. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 58 patients who were diagnosed with ALI among 7593 patients who underwent lung cancer surgery between January 2009 and December 2016. RESULTS: Of the 58 patients, 42 (72{\%}) received corticosteroid treatment within 72 h (early treatment group) and 16 (28{\%}) received corticosteroid treatment more than 72 h after ALI occurred (late treatment group). The early treatment group demonstrated a higher response to corticosteroid treatment compared with the late treatment group (95{\%} versus 69{\%}, respectively, p = 0.014), had an improved lung injury score (86{\%} versus 63{\%}, p = 0.072), and were more likely to be successfully weaned from the ventilator within 7 days (57{\%} versus 39{\%}, p = 0.332). During corticosteroid treatment, the early treatment group had a lower rate of delirium (24{\%} versus 63{\%}, p = 0.012) compared with the late treatment group. No significant differences in length of stay (30 versus 37 days, p = 0.254) or in-hospital mortality (43{\%} versus 38{\%}, p = 0.773) were observed; however, the early treatment group tended to have a higher rate of successful weaning than the late treatment group ( p = 0.098, log-rank test). CONCLUSIONS: Early initiation of corticosteroid treatment improved lung injury and promoted ventilator weaning in patients with ALI following lung resection for lung cancer.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To investigate the effect of intraoperative remimazolam sedation on postoperative sleep quality in elderly patients after total joint arthroplasty. Methods: Between May 15, 2021 and March 26, 2022, 108 elderly patients (age ≥65 years) who received total joint arthroplasty under neuraxial anesthesia were randomized into remimazolam group (a loading dose of 0.025--0.1 mg/kg and followed by an infusion rate of 0.1--1.0 mg/kg/h till end of surgery) or routine group (sedation was given on patient's requirement by dexmedetomidine 0.2--0.7 μg/kg/h). Primary outcome was the subjective sleep quality at surgery night which was evaluated by Richards Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ). Secondary outcomes included RCSQ scores at postoperative first and second nights and numeric rating scale pain intensity within first 3 days after surgery. Results: RCSQ score at surgery night was 59 (28, 75) in remimazolam group which was comparable with 53 (28, 67) in routine group (median difference 6, 95{\%} CI −6 to 16, P = 0.315). After adjustment of confounders, preoperative high Pittsburg sleep quality index was associated worse RCSQ score (P = 0.032), but not remimazolam (P = 0.754). RCSQ score at postoperative first night {$[$}69 (56, 85) vs. 70 (54, 80), P = 0.472{$]$} and second night {$[$}80 (68, 87) vs. 76 (64, 84), P = 0.066{$]$} were equivalent between two groups. Safety outcomes were comparable between the two groups. Conclusions: Intraoperative remimazolam did not significantly improve postoperative sleep quality in elderly patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty. But it is proved to be effective and safe for moderate sedation in these patients. Clinical trial number and registry URL: ChiCTR2000041286 (www.chictr.org.cn).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative neurological injuries, including cognitive dysfunction, sleep disorder, delirium, and anxiety, are the important consequences of coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Evidence has shown that postoperative sleep disturbance is partly due to disturbed melatonin secretion in the perioperative period. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of melatonin on postoperative sleep disorder in patients undergoing CABG. METHOD: One hundred forty-five elective CABG patients participated in a randomized double-blind study during the preoperative period. The patients were randomized to receive either 3 mg of melatonin or 10 mg of Oxazepam one hour before sleep time. Each group received the medication from 3 days before surgery until the time of discharge. Sleep quality was evaluated using the Groningen Sleep Quality Score (GSQS), and the incidence of delirium was evaluated by nursing records. Sleep quality and anxiety scores were compared before and after surgery through the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and independent t-test were used to compare the sleep and anxiety scores between the groups. P values </= 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Totally, 137 patients at a mean age of 60 years completed the study (76{\%} male). The analysis of the data showed that sleep was significantly disturbed after surgery in both groups. The patients in the Oxazepam group demonstrated significantly higher disturbance in their mean postoperative GSQS score than did their counterparts in the melatonin group (p value < 0.001). A smaller proportion of the participants experienced delirium in the melatonin group (0.06{\%}) than in the Oxazepam group (0.12{\%}); however, this difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The result of the present study revealed that melatonin improved sleep in post-cardiac surgery patients more than what was observed with Oxazepam. Therefore, melatonin may be considered an effective alternative for Benzodiazepines in the management of postoperative sleep disorder.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Prophylactic corticosteroids are often administered during cardiac surgery to attenuate the inflammatory response to cardiopulmonary bypass and surgical trauma; however, evidence that routine corticosteroid use can prevent major adverse events is lacking. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the effect of intraoperative high-dose dexamethasone on the incidence of major adverse events in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 4494 patients aged 18 years or older undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass at 8 cardiac surgical centers in The Netherlands enrolled between April 13, 2006, and November 23, 2011. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to receive a single intraoperative dose of 1 mg/kg dexamethasone (n = 2239) or placebo (n = 2255). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, or respiratory failure, within 30 days of randomization. RESULTS: Of the 4494 patients who underwent randomization, 4482 (99.7{\%}) could be evaluated for the primary outcome. A total of 157 patients (7.0{\%}) in the dexamethasone group and 191 patients (8.5{\%}) in the placebo group reached the primary study end point (relative risk, 0.83; 95{\%} CI, 0.67-1.01; absolute risk reduction, -1.5{\%}; 95{\%} CI, -3.0{\%} to 0.1{\%}; P = .07). Dexamethasone was associated with reductions in postoperative infection, duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation, and lengths of intensive care unit and hospital stays. In contrast, dexamethasone was associated with higher postoperative glucose levels. CONCLUSION: In our trial of adults undergoing cardiac surgery, the use of intraoperative dexamethasone did not reduce the 30-day incidence of major adverse events compared with placebo.

@article{7722,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium is frequent in older adults and is associated with postoperative neurocognitive disorder (PND). Studies evaluating perioperative medication use and delirium have generally evaluated medications in aggregate and been poorly controlled; the association between perioperative medication use and PND remains unclear. We sought to evaluate the association between medication use and postoperative delirium and PND in older adults undergoing major elective surgery. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study of adults >/=70 years without dementia undergoing major elective surgery. Patients were interviewed preoperatively to determine home medication use. Postoperatively, daily hospital use of 7 different medication classes listed in guidelines as risk factors for delirium was collected; administration before delirium was verified. While hospitalized, patients were assessed daily for delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method and a validated chart review method. Cognition was evaluated preoperatively and 1 month after surgery using a neurocognitive battery. The association between prehospital medication use and postoperative delirium was assessed using a generalized linear model with a log link function, controlling for age, sex, type of surgery, Charlson comorbidity index, and baseline cognition. The association between daily postoperative medication use (when class exposure >/=5{\%}) and time to delirium was assessed using time-varying Cox models adjusted for age, sex, surgery type, Charlson comorbidity index, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE)-II score, and baseline cognition. Mediation analysis was utilized to evaluate the association between medication use, delirium, and cognitive change from baseline to 1 month. RESULTS: Among 560 patients enrolled, 134 (24{\%}) developed delirium during hospitalization. The multivariable analyses revealed no significant association between prehospital benzodiazepine (relative risk {$[$}RR{$]$}, 1.44; 95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$}, 0.85-2.44), beta-blocker (RR, 1.38; 95{\%} CI, 0.94-2.05), NSAID (RR, 1.12; 95{\%} CI, 0.77-1.62), opioid (RR, 1.22; 95{\%} CI, 0.82-1.82), or statin (RR, 1.34; 95{\%} CI, 0.92-1.95) exposure and delirium. Postoperative hospital benzodiazepine use (adjusted hazard ratio {$[$}aHR{$]$}, 3.23; 95{\%} CI, 2.10-4.99) was associated with greater delirium. Neither postoperative hospital antipsychotic (aHR, 1.48; 95{\%} CI, 0.74-2.94) nor opioid (aHR, 0.82; 95{\%} CI, 0.62-1.11) use before delirium was associated with delirium. Antipsychotic use (either presurgery or postsurgery) was associated with a 0.34 point (standard error, 0.16) decrease in general cognitive performance at 1 month through its effect on delirium (P = .03), despite no total effect being observed. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of benzodiazepines to older adults hospitalized after major surgery is associated with increased postoperative delirium. Association between inhospital, postoperative medication use and cognition at 1 month, independent of delirium, was not detected.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium affects up to 50{\%} of patients undergoing esophagectomy and is associated with negative outcomes. The perioperative risk factors for delirium in this population are not well understood. We conducted this study to assess perioperative risk factors for postoperative delirium among esophagectomy patients. METHODS: We performed a secondary data analysis of patients enrolled in a randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of haloperidol prophylaxis postoperatively in reducing delirium among esophagectomy patients. Postoperative delirium was assessed twice daily using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU. Univariate and logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the association between perioperative variables and development of postoperative delirium. RESULTS: Of 84 consecutive esophagectomy patients, postoperative delirium developed in 27 (32{\%}). These patients had higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores (22.1 {$[$}SD, 6.5{$]$} vs 17.4 {$[$}SD, 6.8{$]$}; p = 0.003), longer mechanical ventilation days (1.7 {$[$}SD, 1.4{$]$} days vs 1.0 {$[$}SD, 1.1{$]$} days; p = 0.001), and longer intensive care unit (ICU) days (5.1 {$[$}SD, 2.6{$]$} days vs 2.6 {$[$}SD, 1.6{$]$} days; p < 0.001). In a logistic regression model, only ICU length of stay had a significant association with postoperative delirium (odds ratio, 1.65; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.21 to 2.25). CONCLUSIONS: ICU length of stay was significantly associated with postoperative delirium. Other perioperative factors, including duration of procedure, blood loss, and hemoglobin levels, were not significantly associated with postoperative delirium.},

METHODS: A total of 201 patients (age >/=75 years) who underwent elective surgery were enrolled. The patients were divided into two groups: the intervention group (n = 101) received prophylactic haloperidol (5 mg); the control group (n = 100) did not. Haloperidol was administered daily during postoperative days 0-5 to the patients who presented with NEECHAM scores of 20-24 when measured at 18:00. The primary endpoint was the incidence of severe postoperative delirium. RESULTS: The incidence of severe postoperative delirium in all patients was 25.1{\%}. The incidence of severe postoperative delirium in the intervention group (18.2{\%}) was significantly lower than that in the control group (32.0{\%}) (p = 0.02). The difference between the two groups was larger when the analysis was limited to the 70 patients who had NEECHAM scores of 20-24 for at least one day during postoperative days 0-5. No adverse effects of the haloperidol were observed.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Postoperative delirium is the most common postoperative complication in the elderly. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the preventive administration of low-dose haloperidol on the development of postoperative delirium after abdominal or orthopedic surgery in elderly patients. SUBJECTS: A total of 119 patients aged 75 years or older who underwent elective surgery for digestive or orthopedic disease were included in this study. METHODS: Patients were divided into those who did (intervention group, n = 59) and did not (control group, n = 60) receive 2.5 mg of haloperidol at 18:00 daily for 3 days after surgery; a randomized, open-label prospective study was performed on these groups. The primary endpoint was the incidence of postoperative delirium during the first 7 days after the operation. RESULTS: The incidence of postoperative delirium in all patients was 37.8{\%}. No side effects involving haloperidol were noted; however, the incidences of postoperative delirium were 42.4 and 33.3{\%} in the intervention and control groups, respectively, which were not significantly different (p = 0.309). No significant effect of the treatment was observed on the severity or persistence of postoperative delirium. CONCLUSIONS: The preventive administration of low-dose haloperidol did not induce any adverse events, but also did not significantly decrease the incidence or severity of postoperative delirium or shorten its persistence.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative cognitive decline (POCD), a very common complication after cardiac surgery, is characterised by impairment of both memory function and intellectual ability as well as being associated with increased use of healthcare resources. The investigators focused on the role of the inflammatory response to a surgical procedure as a potential factor involved in the pathogenesis of POCD. OBJECTIVE: The use of prophylactic dexamethasone to attenuate the inflammatory response was hypothesised to reduce the risk of POCD. DESIGN: Randomised controlled study. SETTING: Single university teaching hospital, from March 2015 to January 2016. PATIENTS: A total of 169 patients scheduled for elective cardiac surgery were enrolled, and 161 patients were included in the analyses. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomised to receive a single intravenous bolus of 0.1 mg kg dexamethasone (n = 85) or placebo (n = 84) 10 h before the surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure in both groups was the incidence of POCD on the 6th day after surgery. The investigators also evaluated the effect of dexamethasone on the incidence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, postoperative C-reactive protein levels and postoperative serum S100βprotein levels. RESULTS: Compared to the placebo group, the dexamethasone group showed statistically significant reductions in the incidence of POCD (relative risk, 0.43; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.21 to 0.89; P = 0.02), the incidence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (30.0 versus 58.0{\%}, P < 0.001) and postoperative C-reactive protein levels (P < 0.001). Postoperative S100βlevels were insignificantly lower (P = 0.56) in the dexamethasone group. CONCLUSION: Preoperative administration of dexamethasone reduced the inflammatory response and thereby decreased the risk of early POCD after cardiac surgery.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this randomized, parallel-arm trial was to study the effect of treating subsyndromal delirium with risperidone on the incidence of clinical delirium in elderly patients who underwent on-pump cardiac surgery. METHODS: One hundred one patients aged 65 yr or older who experienced subsyndromal delirium after on-pump cardiac surgery were randomized using a computer-generated list to receive 0.5 mg risperidone (n = 51) or placebo (n = 50) every 12 h by mouth. Patients were assessed at 8 h by a blinded observer using the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist, and those scoring more than 3 were evaluated by a blinded psychiatrist to confirm delirium. Patients in either group who experienced delirium were treated according to the same algorithm. Initially, risperidone was administered and if symptoms were not controlled, haloperidol was administered. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who experienced delirium in either group. RESULTS: Seven (13.7{\%}) patients in the risperidone group experienced delirium versus 17 (34{\%}) in the placebo group (P = 0.031) Competing-risks regression analysis showed that failure to treat subsyndromal delirium with risperidone was an independent risk factor for delirium (subhazard ratio, 3.83; 95{\%} CI, 1.63-8.98; P = 0.002). Two (3.9{\%}) patients in the risperidone group experienced extrapyramidal manifestations versus one (2{\%}) in the placebo group (P = 1.0). CONCLUSION: Administration of risperidone to elderly patients who experienced subsyndromal delirium after on-pump cardiac surgery was associated with significantly lower incidence of delirium. Larger studies are required to determine whether early administration of risperidone during the subsyndromal phase of delirium would influence the clinical course of such patients.},

	abstract = {Objective: To study the preventive effect of dexmedetomidine (DEX) on the postoperative delirium (POD) in elderly patients aged over 75 years old after vertebral fracture operation, and its regulating effect on the depth of anesthesia during operation. Methods: A total of 90 patients aged 75-90 years old with vertebral fractures surgically treated under general anesthesia in Nanxiang Hospital of Shanghai Jiading District from January 2015 to December 2017 were enrolled in this study. They were randomly divided into the DEX group (group A, n=30), the midazolam group (group B, n=30) and the control group (group C, n=30). Group A was injected with DEX (0.5 μg/kg) through a pump for 10 min before anesthesia induction, and then the drug was maintained at 0.4 μg/(kg·h) until the end of operation; group B received intravenous injection of 0.03 mg/kg midazolam; group C was given the same dose of normal saline. During operation, the bispectral index (BIS) was used to monitor the depth of anesthesia, which was maintained by adjusting the inspired concentration of sevoflurane (BIS value: 55-60). The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, extubation time, Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale at extubation, intraoperative sevoflurane dosage, statuses of postoperative nausea, vomiting, dizziness and other adverse reactions, and delirium assessment at 1-5 days after operation (confusion assessment method) were recorded and compared. Results: There were no significant differences in general condition, operation time, intraoperative blood loss and fracture site among the three groups of patients (all P>0.05). Extubation time in group B was longer than those in group A and C (P<0.05), and there was no significant difference in extubation time between group A and C (P>0.05). The agitation rates at extubation of patients in group B and C were significantly higher than that in group A (P<0.05). The intraoperative dosage of sevoflurane in group A was obviously less than those in group B and C (P<0.05). There were no significant differences in the incidence rate of postoperative adverse reactions among the three groups of patients (P>0.05). The incidence rate of POD in group A was apparently lower than those in group B and C (P<0.05); the incidence rate of POD at 1-2 days after operation in group B was higher than that in group C (P<0.05); there was no significant difference in the incidence rate of POD at 3-5 days after operation between group B and C (P>0.05). Conclusion: DEX not only had a good sedative effect, but also could be used in combination with sevoflurane to control the depth of anesthesia, reduce the dosage of sevoflurane, and lower the incidence rate of POD in elderly patients after vertebral fracture operation and the agitation rate at extubation under general anesthesia.},

@article{1937,
	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: Delirium is frequently observed in the postoperative and intensive care unit (ICU) population. Due to the multifactorial origin of delirium and according to international guidelines (e.g., American Geriatrics Society; Prevention and Management of Pain, Agitation/Sedation, Delirium, Immobility, and Sleep Disruption (PADIS) guideline), there are several but no incontestable options for prevention and symptomatic treatment. The purpose of the Baden PRIDe (Prevention and Reduction of Incidence of postoperative Delirium) trial was to determine whether postoperative cognitive dysfunction and delirium could be prevented by the combination of possible preventive agents such as haloperidol and ketamine. In addition, pre- and postoperative levels of the biomarkers cortisol, neuron specific enolase (NSE) and S100βwere measured to investigate their dynamics in delirious and non-delirious patients after surgery. DESIGN: The Baden PRIDe Trial was an investigator-initiated, phase IV, two-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial. SETTING: Perioperative care. PATIENTS: 182 adult patients that underwent elective or emergency surgery under general or combined (i.e., general and regional) anaesthesia. INTERVENTIONS: Pre-anaesthetic, pharmacologic prevention of postoperative brain dysfunction with haloperidol, ketamine, and the combination of both vs. placebo. MEASUREMENTS: Assessment of cognitive performance pre- and postoperatively with the MMSE, the DOS, the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (Nu-DESC) or the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) during ICU stay. MAIN RESULTS: None of the three study arms - haloperidol, ketamine, or both drugs combined - was significantly superior to placebo for prevention of postoperative brain dysfunction and delirium (P = 0.39). Measured levels of postoperative cortisol were significantly higher in delirious patients. S-100βlevels were significantly higher in all postoperative outcome groups (cognitive impairment, delirium, no cognitive decline), whereas postoperative NSE levels declined in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: The study results offer no possibility for a novel recommendation for prevention of postoperative cognitive decline including delirium. Perioperative S-100βtrajectories in patients with cognitive deterioration suggest affection of glial cells in particular.

	abstract = {There are many drugs that affect postoperative cognitive function in patients under general anesthesia. Pentanethaquine hydrochloride (PHC), as a new type of anti-cholinergic drug, has been widely used. In clinical practice, many patients, especially elderly patients, have suffered from obvious postoperative cognitive dysfunction, but the incidence of pulmonary infection, reduced probably due to the decease of secretion production. Therefore, the effect of PHC on postoperative cognitive functions and inflammatory factors in elderly lung cancer patients under general anesthesia were mainly discussed to determine the clinical advantages and disadvantages. Ninety elderly patients undergoing thoracoscopic surgery for lung cancer under general anesthesia were selected and divided into PHC group (group A, n = 30), atropine group (group B, n = 30) and normal saline control group (group C, n = 30). The incidence of postoperative blurred vision was higher in group A compared to group B and C (both p < 0.05). The incidence of other adverse reactions was higher in group A compared to group C (all p < 0.05), but there was no difference between group A and group B (all p > 0.05). There was no significant difference in preoperative and day 1 post-surgery mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores among the three groups (both p > 0.05), but the day 1 post-surgery MMSE scores of three groups were lower (all p < 0.05). PHC increased the incidence of postoperative cognitive impairment and postoperative delirium in elderly lung cancer patients undergoing thoracoscopic surgery under general anesthesia, but reduced the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications possibly by reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines.},

@article{18474,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common complication along with poor prognosis in geriatric intertrochanteric fracture (ITF) patients. However, the prevention and treatment of POD remain unclear. Previous studies have confirmed that POD is essentially a consequence of neuro-inflammatory responses. Dexamethasone is a glucocorticoid with comprehensive anti-inflammatory effects, while a high dose of dexamethasone correlates with many side effects or even adverse consequences. Thus, this prospective study aims to discuss whether a single preoperative low-dose dexamethasone can reduce the impact of POD on geriatric ITF patients with internal fixation surgery. METHODS: Between June 2020 and October 2022, there were 219 consecutive ITF patients assessed in our department. Of the 219 ITF patients, 160 cases who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were finally enrolled and randomly allocated to the dexamethasone group and the placebo group (80 geriatric ITF patients in each group) in this prospective study. The patients in the dexamethasone group received intravenous 10 mg (2 ml) dexamethasone while the patients in the placebo group received intravenous 2 ml saline in 30 min before being sent to the operating room, respectively. The baseline characteristics, surgical information, incidence and severity of POD as the efficacy-related outcomes, and infection events and hyperglycemia as safety-related outcomes (adverse events), were collected and analyzed between the two groups. The severity of POD was evaluated by Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS) score. RESULTS: There were no differences in baseline characteristics and surgical information between the dexamethasone group and the placebo group. The dexamethasone group had a lower incidence of POD than the placebo group within the first 5 days after surgery {$[$}(9/80, 11.3{\%} vs. 21/80, 26.3{\%}, RR = 0.83, 95{\%} CI 0.71-0.97, P = 0.015{$]$}. The dexamethasone group had lower MDAS scores (Mean $\pm$SD) than the placebo group {$[$}13.2 $\pm$1.0 (range 11 to 15) vs. 15.48 $\pm$2.9 (range 9 to 20), P = 0.011, effect size = 0.514{$]$}. There were no differences in infection events and hyperglycemia between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: A single preoperative low-dose dexamethasone may reduce the incidence and severity of POD in geriatric ITF patients with internal fixation surgery.

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to perform a statistical evaluation of the risk factors for postoperative delirium after oral tumor resection and reconstructive surgery. The records of 69 consecutive patients who underwent major head and neck tumor resection and reconstructive surgery, and who received postoperative management in the high care unit (HCU) or intensive care unit (ICU) of Tsukuba University Hospital between January 2013 and December 2017, were analysed retrospectively. Delirium was diagnosed in 23 patients (33.3{\%}) after surgery. There were significant differences in age, sex, history of diabetes mellitus and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, recent hospitalization history, sedation period, duration of ventilator use, length of ICU/HCU stay, postoperative blood tests (haemoglobin and potassium), and postoperative medication with a major tranquilizer between those with and without delirium. Logistic regression analysis of selected independent variables revealed a hazard ratio (95{\%} confidence interval) of 1.42 (1.09--1.86) for the sedation period. Delirium was hyperactive type in 15 cases, hypoactive type in five, and mixed type in three. There was no obvious difference in postoperative day of onset or delirium period according to subtype. In conclusion, a history of diabetes and the sedation period were found to be related to postoperative delirium. However, this study was small and retrospective, so further investigation is necessary.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To study the effectiveness of haloperidol prophylaxis on incidence, severity, and duration of postoperative delirium in elderly hip-surgery patients at risk for delirium. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Large medical school-affiliated general hospital in Alkmaar, The Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 430 hip-surgery patients aged 70 and older at risk for postoperative delirium. INTERVENTION: Haloperidol 1.5 mg/d or placebo was started preoperatively and continued for up to 3 days postoperatively. Proactive geriatric consultation was provided for all randomized patients. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative delirium (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, and Confusion Assessment Method criteria). Secondary outcomes were the severity of delirium (Delirium Rating Scale, revised version-98 (DRS-R-98)), the duration of delirium, and the length of hospital stay. RESULTS: The overall incidence of postoperative delirium was 15.8{\%}. The percentage of patients with postoperative delirium in the haloperidol and placebo treatment condition was 15.1{\%} and 16.5{\%}, respectively (relative risk=0.91, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI)=0.6-1.3); the mean highest DRS-R-98 score+/-standard deviation was 14.4+/-3.4 and 18.4+/-4.3, respectively (mean difference 4.0, 95{\%} CI=2.0-5.8; P<.001); delirium duration was 5.4 versus 11.8 days, respectively (mean difference 6.4 days, 95{\%} CI=4.0-8.0; P<.001); and the mean number of days in the hospital was 17.1+/-11.1 and 22.6+/-16.7, respectively (mean difference 5.5 days, 95{\%} CI=1.4-2.3; P<.001). No haloperidol-related side effects were noted. CONCLUSION: Low-dose haloperidol prophylactic treatment demonstrated no efficacy in reducing the incidence of postoperative delirium. It did have a positive effect on the severity and duration of delirium. Moreover, haloperidol reduced the number of days patients stayed in the hospital, and the therapy was well tolerated.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Delirium after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) should be prevented because it is associated with worse patient outcomes. Perioperative administration of benzodiazepines is a risk factor for postoperative delirium; however, the association between remimazolam, a newer ultrashort-acting benzodiazepine for general anesthesia, and postoperative delirium remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate whether remimazolam administration during TAVI under general anesthesia affected the incidence of postoperative delirium. Methods: This single-center retrospective study recruited all adult patients who underwent transfemoral TAVI (TF-TAVI) under general anesthesia between March 2020 and May 2022. Patients were divided into the remimazolam (R) and propofol (P) groups according to the sedative used for anesthesia. In the R group, all patients received flumazenil after surgery. The primary endpoint was the incidence of delirium within 3 days after surgery. Factors associated with delirium after TF-TAVI were examined by multiple logistic regression analysis. Results: Ninety-eight patients were included in the final analysis (R group, n = 40; P group, n = 58). The incidence of postoperative delirium was significantly lower in the R group than in the P group (8{\%} vs. 26{\%}, p = 0.032). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that remimazolam (odds ratio 0.17, 95{\%} CI 0.04--0.80, p = 0.024) was independently associated with the incidence of postoperative delirium, even after adjustment for age, sex, preoperative cognitive function, history of stroke, and TF-TAVI approach. Conclusion: Remimazolam may benefit TF-TAVI in terms of postoperative delirium; however, its usefulness must be further evaluated in extensive prospective studies.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) delirium is a potentially preventable condition that results in a significant long-term effect. In a multicentre prospective cohort study, we investigate the incidence and risk factors of postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery. METHODS: Patients were consented and recruited from 4 major hospitals in Singapore. Research ethics approval was obtained. Patients older than 65 years undergoing non-cardiac surgery >2 hours were recruited. Baseline perioperative data were collected. Preoperative baseline cognition was obtained. Patients were assessed in the post-anaesthesia care unit for delirium 30-60 minutes after arrival using the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (Nu-DESC). RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients completed the study. Eleven patients (11.2{\%}) had postoperative delirium. Patients who had PACU delirium were older (74.6+/-3.2 versus 70.6+/-4.4 years, P=0.005). Univariate analysis showed those who had PACU delirium are more likely to be ASA 3 (63.6{\%} vs 31.0{\%}, P=0.019), had estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of >60mL/min/1.73m2 (36.4{\%} vs 10.6{\%}, P=0.013), higher HbA1C value (7.8+/-1.2 vs 6.6+/-0.9, P=0.011), raised random blood glucose (10.0+/-5.0mmol/L vs 6.5+/-2.4mmol/L, P=0.0066), and moderate-severe depression (18.2{\%} vs 1.1{\%}, P=0.033). They are more likely to stay longer in hospital (median 8 days {$[$}range 4-18{$]$} vs 4 days {$[$}range 2-8{$]$}, P=0.049). Raised random blood glucose is independently associated with increased PACU delirium on multivariate analysis.},

@article{16961,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative Delirium (POD) is the most frequent neurocognitive complication after general anesthesia in older patients. The development of POD is associated with prolonged periods of burst suppression activity in the intraoperative electroencephalogram (EEG). The risk to present burst suppression activity depends not only on the age of the patient but is also more frequent during propofol anesthesia as compared to inhalative anesthesia. The aim of our study is to determine, if the risk to develop POD differs depending on the anesthetic agent given and if this correlates with a longer duration of intraoperative burst suppression. METHODS: In this secondary analysis of the SuDoCo trail {$[$}ISRCTN 36437985{$]$} 1277 patients, older than 60 years undergoing general anesthesia were included. We preprocessed and analyzed the raw EEG files from each patient and evaluated the intraoperative burst suppression duration. In a logistic regression analysis, we assessed the impact of burst suppression duration and anesthetic agent used for maintenance on the risk to develop POD. RESULTS: 18.7{\%} of patients developed POD. Burst suppression duration was prolonged in POD patients (POD 27.5 min $\pm$21.3 min vs. NoPOD 21.4 $\pm$16.2 min, p < 0.001), for each minute of prolonged intraoperative burst suppression activity the risk to develop POD increased by 1.1{\%} (OR 1.011, CI 95{\%} 1.000-1.022, p =  0.046). Burst suppression duration was prolonged under propofol anesthesia as compared to sevoflurane and desflurane anesthesia (propofol 32.5 $\pm$20.3 min, sevoflurane 17.1 $\pm$12.6 min and desflurane 20.1 $\pm$16.0 min, p < 0.001). However, patients receiving desflurane anesthesia had a 1.8fold higher risk to develop POD, as compared to propofol anesthesia (OR 1.766, CI 95{\%} 1.049-2.974, p =  0.032). CONCLUSION: We found a significantly increased risk to develop POD after desflurane anesthesia in older patients, even though burst suppression duration was shorter under desflurane anesthesia as compared to propofol anesthesia. Our finding might help to explain some discrepancies in studies analyzing the impact of burst suppression duration and EEG-guided anesthesia on the risk to develop POD.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of remimazolam on postoperative cognitive function, intraoperative hemodynamics, and oxygenation in older patients undergoing lobectomy. DESIGN: A prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled study. SETTING: A university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-four older patients with lung cancer who underwent lobectomy, aged ≥65 years. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were divided randomly into the remimazolam (group R) and propofol (group P) groups. Group R underwent remimazolam anesthesia induction and maintenance, whereas group P underwent propofol anesthesia induction and maintenance. Cognitive function was assessed with neuropsychological tests 1 day before surgery and 7 days after surgery. The Clock Drawing Test, Verbal Fluency Test (VFT), Digit Symbol Switching Test (DSST), and Auditory Verbal Learning Test-Huashan (AVLT-H) assessed visuospatial ability, language function, attention, and memory, respectively. The systolic blood pressure (SBP), heart rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and cardiac index were recorded 5 minutes before induction of anesthesia (T0), 2 minutes after sedation (T1), 5 minutes after intubation with two-lung ventilation (T2), 30 minutes after one-lung ventilation (OLV) (T3), 60 minutes after OLV (T4), and at the end of surgery (T5), and the incidences of hypotension and bradycardia were recorded. The PaO(2), oxygenation index (OI), and intrapulmonary shunt (Qs/Qt) were assessed at T0, T2, T3, T4, and T5. The levels of S-100βand interleukin 6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at T0, T5, 24 hours after surgery (T6), and on day 7 after surgery (T7). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The VFT, DSST, immediate recall AVLT-H, and short-delayed recall AVLT-H scores were significantly higher in group R than in group P on day 7 after surgery (p < 0.05). The SBP and MAP at T2 to T5 were significantly higher in group R than in group P, the incidence of hypotension was significantly lower in group R (9.5{\%}) than in group P (35.7{\%}) (p = 0.004), and remimazolam significantly reduced the dose of phenylephrine used (p < 0.05). The PaO(2) and OI at T4 were significantly higher in group R than in group P, and Qs/Qt was significantly lower in group R than in group P. The levels of S-100βat T5 were significantly lower in group R than in group P (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results showed that remimazolam (versus propofol) may lessen the degree of short-term postoperative cognitive dysfunction measured by standard neuropsychological tests, better optimize intraoperative hemodynamics, and lead to improved oxygenation during OLV.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delirium is a serious postoperative condition for which few pharmacologic prevention trials have been conducted. OBJECTIVE: The authors tested the efficacy of perioperative olanzapine administration to prevent postoperative delirium in elderly patients after joint-replacement surgery. METHOD: The authors conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prophylaxis trial at an orthopedic teaching hospital, enrolling 495 elderly patients age >/=65 years, who were undergoing elective knee- or hip-replacement surgery; 400 patients received either 5 mg of orally-disintegrating olanzapine or placebo just before and after surgery. The primary efficacy outcome was the incidence of (DSM-III-R) delirium. RESULTS: The incidence of delirium was significantly lower in the olanzapine group than in the placebo group; this held true for both knee- and hip-replacement surgery. However, delirium lasted longer and was more severe in the olanzapine group. Advanced age, a high level of medical comorbidity, an abnormal albumin level, and having knee-replacement surgery were independent risk factors for postoperative delirium (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT000699946). CONCLUSION: Administration of 10 mg of oral olanzapine perioperatively, versus placebo, was associated with a significantly lower incidence of delirium. These findings suggest that olanzapine prophylaxis of postoperative delirium may be an effective strategy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: The increase in the average-age and in the percentage of elderly people implies an exponential increase in fractures of the proximal femur. A common consequence of hip fracture in elderly patients is delirium, characterized by cognitive confusion or a lethargic-type condition. Predisposing factors have been identified, but risk factors assessment useful for managing clinical intervention, has not received unanimous consent. This work aims to identify the potential risk factors for delirium in the elderly operated for hip fracture. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, we included 83 patients aged >/=65 years. Patients undergoing osteosynthesis of the femur and hip replacement for fractures were included. Patients already delusional in the pre-operative period were excluded. At the time, deadlines T0 (pre-operative), and T1,T3,T7 post-operative day, delirium, hematic parameters, blood transfusions, were assessed. RESULTS: Level of delirium was assessed obtaining 80{\%} not delusional and 20{\%} delusional. Glycemia and hemoglobin were not found to be risk factors, although they are known to influence cognitive status; we hypothesize they should be considered predisposing factors. Comorbidities such as atrial fibrillation and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease were found associated with delirium. The most advanced age, anxiolytic drugs, the use of benzodiazepine as anaesthetic, the time surgical waiting, were found significantly associated with delirium. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, findings of this prospective observational study showed that environmental and metabolic risk factors might contribute to make elderly susceptible to develop postoperative delirium following hip surgery. Thus, these patients should be adequately assessed and monitored. (www.actabiomedica.it).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative pain and opioid use are associated with postoperative delirium. We designed a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm, double-blinded trial to determine whether perioperative administration of gabapentin reduced postoperative delirium after noncardiac surgery. METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (N = 347) or gabapentin 900 mg (N = 350) administered preoperatively and for the first 3 postoperative days. The primary outcome was postoperative delirium as measured by the Confusion Assessment Method. Secondary outcomes were postoperative pain, opioid use, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Data for 697 patients were included, with a mean $\pm$SD age of 72 $\pm$6 yr. The overall incidence of postoperative delirium in any of the first 3 days was 22.4{\%} (24.0{\%} in the gabapentin and 20.8{\%} in the placebo groups; the difference was 3.20{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 3.22{\%} to 9.72{\%}; P = 0.30). The incidence of delirium did not differ between the two groups when stratified by surgery type, anesthesia type, or preoperative risk status. Gabapentin was shown to be opioid sparing, with lower doses for the intervention group versus the control group. For example, the morphine equivalents for the gabapentin-treated group, median 6.7 mg (25th, 75th quartiles: 1.3, 20.0 mg), versus control group, median 6.7 mg (25th, 75th quartiles: 2.7, 24.8 mg), differed on the first postoperative day (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Although postoperative opioid use was reduced, perioperative administration of gabapentin did not result in a reduction of postoperative delirium or hospital length of stay.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a serious complication after surgery, especially in elderly patients. The anesthesia technique is a potentially modifiable risk factor for POCD. This study assessed the effects of dexmedetomidine, propofol or midazolam sedation on POCD in elderly patients who underwent hip or knee replacement under spinal anesthesia. METHODS: The present study was a prospective randomized controlled preliminary trial. From July 2013 and December 2014, a total of 164 patients aged 65 years or older who underwent hip or knee arthroplasty at China-Japan Friendship Hospital and 41 non-surgical controls were included in this study. Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 3 sedative groups. All the patients received combined spinal-epidural anesthesia (CSEA) with midazolam, dexmedetomidine or propofol sedation. The sedative dose was adjusted to achieve light sedation (bispectral index{$[$}BIS{$]$} score between 70 and 85). All study participants and controls completed a battery of 5 neuropsychological tests before and 7 days after surgery. One year postoperatively, the patients and controls were interviewed over the telephone using the Montreal cognitive assessment 5-minute protocol. RESULTS: In all, 60 of 164 patients (36.6{\%}) were diagnosed with POCD 7 days postoperatively, POCD incidence in propofol group was significantly lower than that in dexmedetomidine and midazolam groups (18.2{\%} vs. 40.0{\%}, 51.9{\%}, χ= 6.342 and 13.603, P = 0.012 and < 0.001). When the patients were re-tested 1 year postoperatively, the incidence of POCD was not significantly different among the 3 groups (14.0{\%}, 10.6{\%} vs. 14.9{\%}, χ= 0.016 and 0.382, P = 0.899 and 0.536). CONCLUSION: Among dexmedetomidine, propofol and midazolam sedation in elderly patients, propofol sedation shows a significant advantage in term of short-term POCD incidence.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To compare the effects of remimazolam and dexmedetomidine on early postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in aged gastric cancer patients. Methods: From June to December 2022, 104 elderly patients (aged 65--80 years) received laparoscopic radical resection of gastric cancer at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University. Using the random number table approach, the patients were separated into three groups: remimazolam (Group R), dexmedetomidine (Group D), and saline (Group C). The primary outcome was the incidence of POCD, and secondary outcomes included TNF-αand S-100βprotein concentrations, hemodynamics, VAS scores, anesthesia recovery indicators, and the occurrence of adverse events within 48 h postoperatively. Results: At 3 and 7 days after surgery, there were no statistically significant differences in the incidence of POCD, the MMSE and MoCA scores between groups R and D (p > 0.05). However, compared to the saline group, both groups had higher MMSE and MoCA scores and decreased incidences of POCD. These differences were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Between group R and group D, there were no statistically significant changes (p > 0.05) in the levels of TNF-αand S-100βprotein at the three time points (at the end of the surgery, 1 day later, and 3 days later). Even though neither group's concentration of the two factors was as high as that of the saline group, the differences were statistically significant (p < 0.05). At all three time points---following induction (T2), 30 min into the operation (T3), and at the conclusion of the surgery (T4)---the heart rate and blood pressure in group R were greater than those in groups D and C. Statistics showed that the differences were significant (p < 0.05). The incidence of intraoperative hypotension was highest in group D and lowest in group R (p < 0.05). The dose of propofol and remifentanil, group C > group R > group D. Extubation and PACU residence times did not differ statistically significantly (p > 0.05) between the three groups. There was no significant difference in VAS scores between groups R and D after 24 h postoperatively (p > 0.05), although both had lower scores than group C, and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). The VAS scores between the three groups at 72 h (T6) and 7 days (T7) were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Adverse reactions such as respiratory depression, hypotension, bradycardia, agitation, drowsiness, and nausea and vomiting had the lowest incidence in group R and the highest incidence in group C (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Remimazolam is similarly beneficial as dexmedetomidine in lowering the incidence of early POCD in aged patients after radical gastric cancer resection, probably due to reduced inflammatory response.},

@article{17038,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: This study was to investigate the incidence and potential predictive factors for postoperative delirium (POD) in older people following urinary calculi surgery, and to establish the corresponding risk stratification score by the significant factors to predict the risk of POD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the perioperative data of 195 patients aged 65 or older who underwent elective urinary calculi surgery between September 2020 and September 2022. POD was defined by chart-based method, and the serum uric acid to creatinine (SUA/Cr) ratio as well as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were calculated, respectively. Identification of the risk factors for POD was performed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Moreover, the risk stratification score was developed based on the regression coefficients of the associated variables. RESULTS: In 195 eligible patients following urinary calculi surgery, the median age was 69 (66-72) and 19 patients ultimately developed POD (9.7{\%}). The results by univariate analysis showed that patients with advanced age, high American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status (≥3) and low SUA/Cr ratio (≤3.3) were more likely to develop POD, but dexmedetomidine can significantly decrease the risk of the occurrence of POD. The multivariate analysis further indicated that high ASA physical status (≥3) and low SUA/Cr ratio (≤3.3) were independently associated with POD, and the POD incidence could obviously be elevated with the increase of risk stratification score. Moreover, patients with delirium had longer hospital stays. CONCLUSION: POD is frequent in geriatric patients following urinary calculi surgery (9.7{\%}). The high ASA physical status (≥3) and low SUA/Cr ratio (≤3.3) were effective predictors of POD. The corresponding risk stratification based on these factors could be beneficial to determining patients who are susceptible to POD, and thus better preventing and reducing the occurrence of POD. However, large prospective studies are needed to confirm this finding.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delirium after surgery is a common condition that leads to poor outcomes. Few studies have examined the effect of postoperative delirium on outcomes after cardiac surgery. OBJECTIVES: To assess the relationship between delirium after cardiac surgery and the following outcomes: length of stay after surgery, prevalence of falls, discharge to a nursing facility, discharge to home with home health services, and use of inpatient physical therapy. METHODS: Electronic medical records of 656 cardiac surgery patients were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: Postoperative delirium occurred in 161 patients (24.5{\%}). Patients with postoperative delirium had significantly longer stays (P < .001) and greater prevalence of falls (P < .001) than did patients without delirium. Patients with delirium also had a significantly greater likelihood for discharge to a nursing facility (P < .001) and need for home health services if discharged to home (P < .001) and a significantly higher need for inpatient physical therapy (P < .001). Compared with patients without postoperative delirium, patients who had this complication were more likely to have received zolpidem and benzodiazepines postoperatively and to have a history of arrhythmias, renal disease, and congestive heart failure. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who have delirium after cardiac surgery have poorer outcomes than do similar patients without this complication. Development and implementation of an extensive care plan to address postoperative delirium is necessary for cardiac surgery patients who are at risk for or have delirium after the surgery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study aimed to compare the effects of preoperative administration of midazolam and dexmedetomidine on cognitive dysfunction prevention after cataract surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This research was a double-blind controlled clinical trial. In this study, 150 candidates for cataract surgery under general anesthesia, over 65 years, and similar to American Society of Anesthesiologists I and II characteristics were selected as the sample and randomly assigned to three groups. Participants of these three groups were treated with 0.1 mg/kg of midazolam, 1 μg/kg of dexmedetomidine, and the same volume of normal saline (control), respectively. Hemodynamic parameters and cognitive dysfunction score of the participants were measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) before the surgery, 24 h and 1 week after the surgery. RESULTS: An evaluation of hemodynamic parameters before anesthesia up to 24 h after the surgery showed no significant difference between the midazolam, dexmedetomidine, and control groups in terms of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and blood oxygen saturation (P > 0.05). In addition, there was no statistically significant difference between the midazolam and dexmedetomidine groups in the MMSE score before the surgery and 24 h and 1 week after that (P > 0.05). However, there was a significant difference between these two groups and control (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference between midazolam and dexmedetomidine in reducing postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). However, there is a significant difference between these two groups and control. Hence, either midazolam or dexmedetomidine can be prescribed to reduce POCD in cataract surgeries.},

	abstract = {Background: Coronary artery bypass graft is one of common cardiac surgeries which unfortunately accompany with some adverse events such as delirium. Proinflammatory processes play an important role in pathogenesis of post-operative delirium. Therefore, the effect of dexamethasone (DEX) on post-operative delirium after cardiac surgery was evaluated. Materials and Methods: This randomized clinical trial study was conducted with objective of evaluation of DEX effects on post-operative deliriums and complications after cardiac surgery. Ninety three eligible patients who undergone coronary arteries bypass graft was divided into two groups of DEX with 43patients and placebo (PCB) with 50patients. DEX group taken 8mg DEX intra-venous before induction of anesthesia followed by 8mg every 8h for 3day and other group received PCB in same way. Results: All patients assessed by Mini-mental status questionnaire and psychiatric interviewing with aim of diagnosing delirium. Extubation time of DEX group was significantly reduced. The first post-operative day deliriums, extubation time, hospital, and intensive-care unit length of stay significantly reduced in DEX group without increasing serious complications such as infectious disease. After administration of DEX only hyperglycemia as an adverse event was increased in DEX group. Other complications of renal, cardiac, cerebrovascular and respiratory system did not show any significant differences between groups. Conclusion: Pre-operative administration of DEX might safely protect brain of the patients who undergone cardiac surgery against post-operative delirium.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: With an ageing population, the demand for joint arthroplasties and the burden of postoperative delirium is likely to increase. Given the lack of large-scale data, we investigated associations between perioperative risk factors and postoperative delirium in arthroplasty surgery. METHODS: This retrospective population-based cohort study, utilized national claims data from the all-payer Premier Healthcare database containing detailed billing information from >25{\%} nationwide hospitalizations. Patients undergoing elective total hip/knee arthroplasty surgery (2006-2016) were included.The primary outcome was postoperative delirium, while potential risk factors included age, gender, race, insurance type, and modifiable exposures including anesthesia type, opioid prescription dose (low/medium/high), benzodiazepines, meperidine, non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, ketamine, corticosteroids, and gabapentinoids. RESULTS: Among 1 694 795 patients' postoperative delirium was seen in 2.6{\%} (14 785/564 226) of hip and 2.9{\%} (32 384/1 130 569) of knee arthroplasties. Multivariable models revealed that the utilization of long acting (OR 2.10 CI 1.82 to 2.42), combined long/short acting benzodiazepines (OR 1.74 CI 1.56 to 1.94), and gabapentinoids (OR 1.26 CI 1.16 to 1.36) was associated with increased odds of postoperative delirium. Lower odds of postoperative delirium were seen for neuraxial versus general anesthesia (OR 0.81 CI 0.70 to 0.93) and with the utilization of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (OR 0.85 CI 0.79 to 0.91) as well as cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (OR 0.82 CI 0.77 to 0.89). Age-stratified analysis revealed lower odds with high versus low opioid dose (OR 0.86 CI 0.76 to 0.98) in patients >65 years. Findings were consistent between hip and knee arthroplasties. CONCLUSIONS: In this large national cohort, we identified various modifiable risk factors (including anesthesia type and pharmaceutical agents) for postoperative delirium, demonstrating possible prevention pathways.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common complication after surgery. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the association between preoperative anticholinergic load calculated using the anticholinergic drug scale (ADS) and POD in cancer patients over 65 years of age. DESIGN: A retrospective sub-investigation of a randomised controlled interventional trial. SETTING: Two tertiary university hospitals. PATIENTS: Overall, patients aged 65 years and older scheduled for surgical treatment of gastrointestinary, genitourinary or gynaecological cancers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the interaction between anticholinergic drug scale and occurrence of postoperative delirium. Patient clinical parameters and ADS scores were assessed preoperatively. POD screening was conducted for a total of 7 days following surgery using validated measures. Independent associations between ADS and POD were assessed using multivariate logistical regression analyses. RESULTS: A total of 651 patients (mean age, 71.8 years; 68.5{\%} males) were included. Of those, 66 patients (10.1{\%}) developed POD. The ADS score was independently associated with the occurrence of POD (higher ADS per point OR 1.496; 95{\%} CI 1.09-2.05; p = 0.01). Additionally, age (per year OR 1.06; CI 95{\%} CI 1.01-1.11; p = 0.03) and ASA state (OR 2.16; 95{\%} CI 1.22-3.83; p = 0.01), as well as stay on ICU (yes vs. no OR 2.8; 95{\%} CI 1.57-4.998; p < 0.01), were independently associated with POD. CONCLUSIONS: ADS assessment according to chronic medication use is a cost-effective, non-invasive method of identifying elderly cancer patients at risk for POD.

Certain pharmacologic agents are known to cause delirium, but those that cause delirium following TJA are unknown. Our aim was to explore if specific anesthetic agents, opiate pain medications, or benzodiazepines are associated with POD following TJA. A matched case (n=98)-control (n=365) design and conditional logistic regression model were used to examine risk factors for POD among TJA patients at our institution from 2006 to 2010. The model was adjusted for gender, pre-operative alcohol use, and pre-operative depression. Our data suggest that isoflurane and benzodiazepines are associated with an increased risk of delirium in TJA patients and should be used with caution. Hydromorphone and morphine did not increase the risk of delirium in TJA patients and may be considered for post-operative pain control.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiac surgery can be complicated by postoperative cognitive decline (POCD), which is characterized by impaired memory function and intellectual ability. The systemic inflammatory response that is induced by major surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass may play an important role in the etiology of POCD. Prophylactic corticosteroids to attenuate the inflammatory response may therefore reduce the risk of POCD. The authors investigated the effect of intraoperative high-dose dexamethasone on the incidence of POCD at 1 month and 12 months after cardiac surgery. METHODS: This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is a preplanned substudy of the DExamethasone for Cardiac Surgery trial. A total of 291 adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were recruited in three hospitals and randomized to receive dexamethasone 1 mg/kg (n = 145) or placebo (n = 146). The main outcome measures were incidence of POCD at 1- and 12-month follow-up, defined as a decline in neuropsychological test performance beyond natural variability, as measured in a control group. RESULTS: At 1-month follow-up, 19 of 140 patients in the dexamethasone group (13.6{\%}) and 10 of 138 patients in the placebo group (7.2{\%}) fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for POCD (relative risk, 1.87; 95{\%} CI, 0.90 to 3.88; P = 0.09). At 12-month follow-up, 8 of 115 patients in the dexamethasone group (7.0{\%}) and 4 of 114 patients (3.5{\%}) in the placebo group had POCD (relative risk, 1.98; 95{\%} CI, 0.61 to 6.40; P = 0.24). CONCLUSION: Intraoperative high-dose dexamethasone did not reduce the risk of POCD after cardiac surgery.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Gabapentin has been increasingly used as part of a multimodal analgesia regimen to reduce opioid use in perioperative pain management. However, the safety of perioperative gabapentin use among older patients remains uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To examine in-hospital adverse clinical events associated with perioperative gabapentin use among older patients undergoing major surgery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study using data from the Premier Healthcare Database included patients aged 65 years or older who underwent major surgery at US hospitals within 7 days of hospital admission from January 1, 2009, to March 31, 2018, and did not use gabapentin before surgery. Data were analyzed from June 14, 2021, to May 23, 2022. EXPOSURES: Gabapentin use within 2 days after surgery. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was delirium, identified using diagnosis codes, and secondary outcomes were new antipsychotic use, pneumonia, and in-hospital death between postoperative day 3 and hospital discharge. To reduce confounding, 1:1 propensity score matching was performed. Risk ratios (RRs) and risk differences (RDs) with 95{\%} CIs were estimated. RESULTS: Among 967 547 patients before propensity score matching (mean {$[$}SD{$]$} age, 76.2 {$[$}7.4{$]$} years; 59.6{\%} female), the rate of perioperative gabapentin use was 12.3{\%} (119 087 patients). After propensity score matching, 237 872 (118 936 pairs) gabapentin users and nonusers (mean {$[$}SD{$]$} age, 74.5 {$[$}6.7{$]$} years; 62.7{\%} female) were identified. Compared with nonusers, gabapentin users had increased risk of delirium (4040 {$[$}3.4{\%}{$]$} vs 3148 {$[$}2.6{\%}{$]$}; RR, 1.28 {$[$}95{\%} CI, 1.23-1.34{$]$}; RD, 0.75 {$[$}95{\%} CI, 0.75 {$[$}0.61-0.89{$]$} per 100 persons), new antipsychotic use (944 {$[$}0.8{\%}{$]$} vs 805 {$[$}0.7{\%}{$]$}; RR, 1.17 {$[$}95{\%} CI, 1.07-1.29{$]$}; RD, 0.12 {$[$}95{\%} CI, 0.05-0.19{$]$} per 100 persons), and pneumonia (1521 {$[$}1.3{\%}{$]$} vs 1368 {$[$}1.2{\%}{$]$}; RR, 1.11 {$[$}95{\%} CI, 1.03-1.20{$]$}; RD, 0.13 {$[$}95{\%} CI, 0.04-0.22{$]$} per 100 persons), but there was no difference in in-hospital death (362 {$[$}0.3{\%}{$]$} vs 354 {$[$}0.2{\%}{$]$}; RR, 1.02 {$[$}95{\%} CI, 0.88-1.18{$]$}; RD, 0.00 {$[$}95{\%} CI, -0.04 to 0.05{$]$} per 100 persons). Risk of delirium among gabapentin users was greater in subgroups with high comorbidity burden than in those with low comorbidity burden (combined comorbidity index <4 vs ≥4: RR, 1.20 {$[$}95{\%} CI, 1.13-1.27{$]$} vs 1.40 {$[$}95{\%} CI, 1.30-1.51{$]$}; RD, 0.41 {$[$}95{\%} CI, 0.28-0.53{$]$} vs 2.66 {$[$}95{\%} CI, 2.08-3.24{$]$} per 100 persons) and chronic kidney disease (absence vs presence: RR, 1.26 {$[$}95{\%} CI, 1.19-1.33{$]$} vs 1.38 {$[$}95{\%} CI, 1.27-1.49{$]$}; RD, 0.56 {$[$}95{\%} CI, 0.42-0.69{$]$} vs 1.97 {$[$}95{\%} CI, 1.49-2.46{$]$} per 100 persons). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, perioperative gabapentin use was associated with increased risk of delirium, new antipsychotic use, and pneumonia among older patients after major surgery. These results suggest careful risk-benefit assessment before prescribing gabapentin for perioperative pain management.},

Multilevel models assessed associations between these factors and postoperative delirium, in the full cohort, and separately in those aged less than 80 and at least 80 years. Odds ratios (ORs) and Bonferroni-adjusted 95{\%} confidence intervals (95{\%} CIs) are reported.RESULTSOverall, postoperative delirium incidence was 15.7{\%} (n = 79 547). After adjustment for relevant covariates, the use of long-acting (OR 1.82, CI 1.74 to 1.89) and combined short and long-acting benzodiazepines (OR 1.56, CI 1.48 to 1.63) and ketamine (OR 1.09, CI 1.03 to 1.15), in particular, was associated with increased odds for postoperative delirium, while neuraxial anaesthesia (OR 0.91 CI 0.85 to 0.98) and opioid use (OR 0.95, CI 0.92 to 0.98 and OR 0.88, CI 0.84 to 0.92 for medium and high dose compared with low dose) were associated with lower odds; all P < 0.05. When analysing data separately by age group, effects of benzodiazepines persisted, while opioid use was only relevant in those aged less than 80 years.CONCLUSIONWe identified modifiable factors associated with postoperative delirium incidence among patients undergoing hip fracture repair surgery.},

	abstract = {This randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study was primarily aimed to evaluate the potential of risperidone to prevent postoperative delirium following cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass and the secondary objective was to explore clinical factors associated with postoperative delirium. One-hundred-and-twenty-six adult patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were randomly assigned to receive either 1 mg of risperidone or placebo sublingually when they regained consciousness. Delirium and other outcomes were assessed. The confusion assessment method for intensive care unit was used to assess postoperative delirium. The incidence of postoperative delirium in the risperidone group was lower than the placebo group (11.1{\%} vs. 31.7{\%} respectively, P=0.009, relative risk = 0.35, 95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$} = 0.16-0.77). Other postoperative outcomes were not statistically different between the groups. In exploring the factors associated with delirium, univariate analysis showed many factors were associated with postoperative delirium. However multiple logistic regression analysis showed a lapse of 70 minutes from the time of opening eyes to following commands and postoperative respiratory failure were independent risk factors (P=0.003, odds ratio {$[$}OR{$]$} = 4.57, 95{\%} CI = 1.66-12.59 and P=0.038, OR = 13.78, 95{\%} CI = 1.15-165.18 respectively). A single dose of risperidone administered soon after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass reduces the incidence of postoperative delirium. Multiple factors tended to be associated with postoperative delirium, but only the time from opening eyes to following commands and postoperative respiratory failure were independent risk factors in this study.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammation after cardiopulmonary bypass may contribute to postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction. The authors evaluated the effect of high-dose methylprednisolone to suppress inflammation on the incidence of delirium and postoperative quality of recovery after cardiac surgery. METHODS: Five hundred fifty-five adults from three hospitals enrolled in the randomized, double-blind Steroids in Cardiac Surgery trial were randomly allocated to placebo or 250 mg methylprednisolone at induction and 250 mg methylprednisolone before cardiopulmonary bypass. Each completed the Postoperative Quality of Recovery Scale before surgery and on days 1, 2, and 3 and 1 and 6 months after surgery and the Confusion Assessment Method scale for delirium on days 1, 2, and 3. Recovery was defined as returning to preoperative values or improvement at each time point. RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-two participants for recovery and 498 participants for delirium were available for analysis. The quality of recovery improved over time but without differences between groups in the primary endpoint of overall recovery (odds ratio range over individual time points for methylprednisolone, 0.39 to 1.45; 95{\%} CI, 0.08-2.04 to 0.40-5.27; P = 0.943) or individual recovery domains (all P > 0.05). The incidence of delirium was 10{\%} (control) versus 8{\%} (methylprednisolone; P = 0.357), with no differences in delirium subdomains (all P > 0.05). In participants with normal (51{\%}) and low baseline cognition (49{\%}), there were no significant differences favoring methylprednisolone in any domain (all P > 0.05). Recovery was worse in patients with postoperative delirium in the cognitive (P = 0.004) and physiologic (P < 0.001) domains. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose intraoperative methylprednisolone neither reduces delirium nor improves the quality of recovery in high-risk cardiac surgical patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delirium is common after cardiac surgery and may be partly related to the systemic inflammatory response triggered by the surgery and the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. We hypothesized that intraoperative administration of high-dose dexamethasone, a drug with potent anti-inflammatory effects, would reduce the incidence of delirium at any time point during the first 4 postoperative days after cardiac surgery. METHODS: This was a single-center substudy within a larger, multicenter placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial, the Dexamethasone for Cardiac Surgery (DECS) trial that randomized patients >/=18 years, undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, to receive, in a double-blind fashion, either dexamethasone 1 mg/kg or placebo at the induction of anesthesia. Over the first 4 postoperative days, we compared between groups the incidence of delirium (based on the Confusion Assessment Method adapted for the intensive care unit, or after intensive care unit discharge, by the Confusion Assessment Method, accompanied by chart review), restraint use, and administered haloperidol, benzodiazepines, and opioids. Data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. The proportion of patients with delirium in the dexamethasone versus the placebo group was compared using the odds ratio (OR) with a 95{\%} confidence interval (CI). The proportion also was compared using logistic regression to adjust for common baseline variables that might confound the presence of delirium between the 2 groups. RESULTS: Of 768 eligible patients, 737 subjects (96.0{\%}) had complete data. The incidence of delirium was similar between the dexamethasone (14.2{\%}) and placebo (14.9{\%}) groups (crude OR = 0.95, 95{\%} CI, 0.63-1.43; adjusted OR = 0.85, 95{\%} CI, 0.55-1.31). Among patients who developed delirium, the median (interquartile range) duration of delirium was similar between the dexamethasone and placebo groups (2 {$[$}1-3{$]$} vs 2 {$[$}1-2{$]$} days, respectively, P = 0.45; WMWodds 0.98, 95{\%} CI, 0.83-1.17). Restraint use and the administration of haloperidol, benzodiazepines, and opioids were also similar between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: The intraoperative administration of dexamethasone did not reduce the incidence or duration of delirium in the first 4 days after cardiac surgery.},

	abstract = {Background: We previously demonstrated that flurbiprofen increased arterial oxygen partial pressure and reduced intrapulmonary shunts. The present study aims to investigate whether flurbiprofen improves intraoperative regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2) and reduces the incidence of postoperative delirium (POD) in elderly patients undergoing one-lung ventilation (OLV). Methods: One hundred and twenty patients undergoing thoracoscopic lobectomy were randomly assigned to the flurbiprofen-treated group (n = 60) and the control-treated group (n = 60). Flurbiprofen was intravenously administered 20 minutes before skin incision. The rScO2 and partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) were recorded during the surgery, and POD was measured by the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) within 5 days after surgery. The study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry with the number ChiCTR1800020032. Results: Compared with the control group, treatment with flurbiprofen significantly improved the mean value of intraoperative rScO2 as well as the PaO2 value (P < 0.05, both) and significantly reduced the baseline values of the rScO2 area under threshold (AUT) (P < 0.01) at 15, 30, and 60 min after OLV in the flurbiprofen-treated group. After surgery, the POD incidence in the flurbiprofen-treated group was significantly decreased compared with that in the control group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Treatment with flurbiprofen may improve rScO2 and reduce the incidence of POD in elderly patients undergoing thoracoscopic one-lung ventilation surgery for lung cancer.

@article{17140,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of general anesthesia on the risk of incident postoperative delirium in older adults undergoing hip surgery. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of haloperidol prophylaxis for delirium clinical trial data. Predefined risk factors for delirium were assessed prior to surgery. Primary outcome was postoperative delirium. Study outcome was compared across patient groups who received either general or regional anesthesia, and for individuals receiving various perioperative medications (benzodiazepines, anticholinergics, and opioids), using multivariable logistic regression after controlling for potential confounders. Subgroup analyses based on baseline cognitive impairment and delirium risk were also undertaken. SETTING: Large medical school-affiliated general hospital in Alkmaar, the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred twenty-six adults aged 70 and older undergoing hip surgery. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative delirium (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, and Confusion Assessment Method criteria). RESULTS: Sixty participants (11.4{\%}) had incident postoperative delirium. One hundred eighty-nine (35.9{\%}) received general anesthesia, 18 (9.5{\%}) of whom developed postoperative delirium, and 337 (64.1{\%}) received regional anesthesia, 42 (12.5{\%}) of whom developed postoperative delirium (adjusted odds ratio=0.81, 95{\%} confidence interval=0.43-1.52, P=.51). Results were stratified for baseline cognitive impairment, age, acute admission, perioperative medication and other delirium risk factors. Delirium was not independently associated with specific drugs or the medication classes opioids, benzodiazepines, and anticholinergics. CONCLUSION: General anesthesia has no distinct effect on incident postoperative delirium in older adults undergoing hip surgery. This also holds for individuals suffering from cognitive impairment or who are otherwise at risk for postoperative delirium. Perioperative use of narcotics, benzodiazepines, and anticholinergic agents was not associated with incident delirium in this cohort of older adults undergoing hip surgery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delirium is common after cardiac surgery and is associated with adverse outcomes. Perioperative benzodiazepine use is associated with delirium and is common during cardiac surgery, which may increase the risk of postoperative delirium. We undertook a pilot study to inform the feasibility of a large randomised cluster crossover trial examining whether an institutional policy of restricted benzodiazepine administration during cardiac surgery (compared with liberal administration) would reduce delirium. METHODS: We conducted a two-centre, pilot, randomised cluster crossover trial with four 4 week crossover periods. Each centre was randomised to a policy of restricted or liberal use, and then alternated between the two policies during the remaining three periods. Our feasibility outcomes were adherence to each policy (goal ≥80{\%}) and outcome assessment (one delirium assessment per day in the ICU in ≥90{\%} of participants). We also evaluated the incidence of intraoperative awareness in one site using serial Brice questionnaires. RESULTS: Of 800 patients undergoing cardiac surgery during the trial period, 127/800 (15.9{\%}) had delirium. Of these, 355/389 (91.3{\%}) received benzodiazepines during the liberal benzodiazepine periods and 363/411 (88.3{\%}) did not receive benzodiazepines during the restricted benzodiazepine periods. Amongst the 800 patients, 740 (92.5{\%}) had ≥1 postoperative delirium assessment per day in the ICU. Of 521 patients screened for intraoperative awareness, one patient (0.2{\%}), managed during the restricted benzodiazepine period (but who received benzodiazepine), experienced intraoperative awareness. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of a large, multicentre, randomised, cluster crossover trial examining whether an institutional policy of restricted vs liberal benzodiazepine use during cardiac surgery will reduce postoperative delirium.

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Little is known about the relationship between sedative drugs used preoperatively and postoperative delirium. Melatonin is a drug used to sedate patients preoperatively and is hypothesized by recent works to have a curative effect on postoperative delirium. AIMS: The incidence of postoperative delirium will be tested if affected by three different sedative drugs including melatonin. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Controlled randomized doubleblind study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three-hundred patients aged>65 years scheduled for hip arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia were randomly distributed to one of the four groups. Group 1 (control) received nothing for sedation. Group 2 (melatonin) received 5 mg melatonin. Group 3 (midazolam) received 7.5 mg midazolam. Group 4 (clonidine) received 100 μg clonidine. These medications were given orally at sleep time at night of operation and another dose 90 min before operative time. Patients who developed postoperative delirium received 5 mg of melatonin 9 pm for three successive days in a trial to treat delirium. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Statistical analysis was done using the SPSS Software (version 13). RESULTS: Total of 222 patients completed the study. Percentage of postoperative delirium in the control group was 32.65{\%} (16/49 patients). The melatonin group showed a statistically significant decrease in the percentage of postoperative delirium to 9.43{\%} (5/53 patients). Melatonin was successful in treating 58.06{\%} of patients suffered postoperative delirium (36/62 patients) with no difference between different groups. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative delirium is affected with the drug used for preoperative sedation. Melatonin was successful in decreasing postoperative delirium when used preoperatively and in treating more than half of patients developed postoperative delirium when used for three postoperative nights.},

	abstract = {Objective Stress and cognitive impairment are common postoperative complications in elder patients who have undergone hip sur-gery. The objective of the work is to evaluate the effects of remimazolam supplemented to combined general anesthesia in improving stress and cognitive performance. Methods A total of 120 patients were included to receive a low dose of remimazolam (0.1 mg/kg/h) intravenously combined with general anesthesia or general anesthesia alone during hip surgery. Assessments were used for evaluating cognitive and psychological performance respectively before surgery (T0), 24 h (T5), and 72 h (T6) after surgery. Physiological parameters including mean artery pressure, heart rate, and blood oxygen levels (SpO2) were measured at T0, 30 min after anesthesia (T1), and completion of surgery (T2). Stress indexes including serum cortisol and norepinephrine levels were measured at T0, T5, and T6. The visual analog scale pain scores were also acquired at 6 h after surgery, 12 h after surgery, and T6. Serum interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-αlevels were acquired at T0, T2, and T6. Results Heart rate and SpO2 levels in the combination group were significantly improved compared to the control group. Serum corti-sol and norepinephrine levels were the highest at T1 and decline over time until T5 in both groups, the two stress indexes of the combination group were significantly lower at T1 and T2. Conclusion Remimazolam supplemented to combined general anesthesia demonstrated significant benefit in reducing stress and cognitive dysfunction in elder patients who underwent hip surgery.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Remimazolam tosilate (RT) is under evaluation as a sedative for endoscopic procedures. Herein, we aimed to evaluate safety including cognition recovery of RT administered in elderly patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and assess its safety dosage. METHODS: Ninety-nine patients presenting for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were randomized to receive 0.1 mg/kg RT (R1) or 0.2 mg/kg RT (R2), or propofol (P). Cognitive functions (memory, attention, and executive function) were measured via neuropsychological tests conducted before sedation and 5 min after recovery to full alertness. Adverse events were also assessed. RESULTS: There were no statistical differences between postoperative and baseline results for R1 group and P group, whereas those for R2 group revealed worsened postoperative cognitive functions (immediate recall and short delay recall) than baseline (P < 0.05). Compared with P group, Scores demonstrated worse restoration of immediate recall in R1 group, immediate recall, short-delayed recall, and attention function in R2 group (P < 0.05). Patients in R2 group had a longer sedation time (12.09 vs 8.27 vs 8.21 min; P < 0.001) and recovery time (6.85 vs 3.82 vs 4.33 min; P < 0.001) than that in R1 group and P group. Moreover, the incidence of hypotension was 3.0{\%} in R1 group, whereas it was 21.2{\%} in R2 group and 48.5{\%} in P group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The addition of 0.1 mg/kg RT as an adjunct to opiate sedation for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy not only achieves more stable perioperative hemodynamics but also achieves acceptable neuropsychiatric functions in elderly patients.},

	abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective clinical review and prospective report of postoperative delirium after cervical spine surgeries. OBJECTIVE: To investigate factors contributing to the development of delirium after cervical surgery and see whether amended therapeutic protocols could improve or alter postoperative outcomes. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Important consequences of postoperative delirium for the orthopedic patients include impaired recovery and increased morbidity and mortality. Although its risk factors have been reported in orthopedic surgery, there are a very few reports regarding postoperative delirium in spine surgery. METHODS: Eighty-one cervical myelopathy patients were retrospectively examined about the incidence of postoperative delirium and the risk factors. Similarly, 41 patients who received postoperative care under modified protocols were prospectively examined. RESULTS: Postoperative delirium occurred more commonly in patients over 70 years and those with hearing impairment. Patients who received high-dose methylprednisolone (>1000 mg) demonstrated an increased incidence of postoperative delirium. Under modified protocol, we reduced the usage of methylprednisolone and encouraged free body movement with cervical orthosis immediately after surgery. The incidence of postoperative delirium was significantly lower under the modified protocol. CONCLUSION: Early commencement of mobilization after cervical spine surgery would be crucial to the prevention of postoperative delirium in the elderly.},

	abstract = {Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a multifactorial adverse event most frequently in elderly patients. This study evaluated the effect of dexamethasone on POCD incidence after noncardiac and nonneurologic surgery. METHODS: One hundred and forty patients (ASA I-II; age 60-87 years) took part in a prospective phase III, double blind, randomized study involving the administration or not of 8 mg of IV dexamethasone before general anesthesia under bispectral index (BIS) between 35-45 or 46-55. Neuropsychological tests were applied preoperatively and on the 3rd, 7th, 21st, 90th and 180th days after surgery and compared with normative data. S100βwas evaluated before and 12 hours after induction of anesthesia. The generalized estimating equations (GEE) method was applied, followed by the posthoc Bonferroni test considering P<0.05 as significant. RESULTS: On the 3rd postoperative day, POCD was diagnosed in 25.2{\%} and 15.3{\%} of patients receiving dexamethasone, BIS 35-45, and BIS 46-55 groups, respectively. Meanwhile, POCD was present in 68.2{\%} and 27.2{\%} of patients without dexamethasone, BIS 35-45 and BIS 46-55 groups (p<0.0001). Neuropsychological tests showed that dexamethasone associated to BIS 46-55 decreased the incidence of POCD, especially memory and executive function. The administration of dexamethasone might have prevented the postoperative increase in S100βserum levels. CONCLUSION: Dexamethasone can reduce the incidence of POCD in elderly patients undergoing surgery, especially when associated with BIS 46-55. The effect of dexamethasone on S100βmight be related with some degree of neuroprotection.},

	abstract = {AIM: To determine if preoperative state anxiety is a risk factor for postoperative delirium in older hip fracture patients. METHODS: A secondary data analysis comprising data from a prospective non-randomized trial including 86 patients with a hip fracture aged 65 years and older was carried out. State anxiety was measured preoperatively using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Delirium and its severity was measured pre- and postoperatively (day 1, 3, 5, 8) by trained research nurses using the Confusion Assessment Method and Delirium Index. RESULTS: A total of 24 patients (27.9{\%}) developed delirium postoperatively. Preoperative state anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) was not associated with postoperative delirium (rb  = 0.135, P = 0.353), duration of postoperative delirium (rho = 0.038, P = 0.861) or severity of postoperative delirium (rho = 0.153, P = 0.160). Independent predictors of postoperative delirium were lower MMSE scores (OR 0.75, 95{\%} CI 0.60-0.95, P = 0.015), osteosynthesis surgery (OR 3.66, 95{\%} CI 1.02-13.15, P = 0,047) and lowest intraoperative diastolic blood pressure (OR 0.92, 95{\%} CI 0.85-0.99, P = 0.031). CONCLUSION: No relationship between state anxiety and postoperative delirium was found, but significant methodological hurdles were observed and discussed providing important groundwork for further research in this area. Further research should focus on reliable measurement of state anxiety in cognitively impaired older populations. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 948-955.},

	abstract = {The aim of the investigation is to clarify the beneficial sedative effects for patients with postoperative intubation in the intensive care unit (ICU) after oral and maxillofacial surgery. Forty patients with postoperative intubation were divided into two groups in method of random number table: midazolam group and dexmedetomidine group. The Ramsay score, the behavioral pain scale (BPS) score, SpO(2), HR, MAP, and RR were recorded before sedation (T0), 30 minutes (T1), 1 hour (T2), 2 hours (T3), 6 hours (T4), and 12 hours (T5) after dexmedetomidine or midazolam initiation in intensive care unit, and 10 minutes after extubation (T6). The rate of incidences of side effects was calculated. Sedation with midazolam was as good as standard sedation with dexmedetomidine in maintaining target sedation level. The BPS score in the midazolam group was higher than that in the dexmedetomidine group. The time of tracheal catheter extraction in the dexmedetomidine group was shorter than that in the midazolam group (p ≤0.001). The incidence of bradycardia in the dexmedetomidine group was higher than that in the midazolam group (p = 0.028). There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of hypotension between the two groups (p = 0.732). The incidence of respiratory depression of group midazolam was higher than that of group dexmedetomidine (p = 0.018). The incidence of delirium in the dexmedetomidine group was significantly lower than that in the midazolam group, and the difference was statistically significant (p = 0.003). Dexmedetomidine and midazolam can meet the needs for sedation in ICU patients. And dexmedetomidine can improve patients' ability to communicate pain compared with midazolam.},

@article{1332,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium is common among older surgical patients and may be associated with anesthetic management during the perioperative period. The aim of this study is to assess whether intravenous midazolam, a short-acting benzodiazepine used frequently as premedication, increased the incidence of postoperative delirium. METHODS: Analyses of existing data were conducted using a database created from 3 prospective studies in patients aged 65 years or older who underwent elective major noncardiac surgery. Postoperative delirium occurring on the first postoperative day was measured using the confusion assessment method. We assessed the association between the use or nonuse of premedication with midazolam and postoperative delirium using a χ2 test, using propensity scores to match up with 3 midazolam patients for each control patient who did not receive midazolam. RESULTS: A total of 1266 patients were included in this study. Intravenous midazolam was administered as premedication in 909 patients (72{\%}), and 357 patients did not receive midazolam. Those who did and did not receive midazolam significantly differed in age, Charlson comorbidity scores, preoperative cognitive status, preoperative use of benzodiazepines, type of surgery, and year of surgery. Propensity score matching for these variables and American Society of Anesthesiology physical status scores resulted in propensity score-matched samples with 1-3 patients who used midazolam (N = 749) for each patient who did not receive midazolam (N = 357). After propensity score matching, all standardized differences in preoperative patient characteristics ranged from -0.07 to 0.06, indicating good balance on baseline variables between the 2 exposure groups. No association was found between premedication with midazolam and incident delirium on the morning of the first postoperative day in the matched dataset, with odds ratio (95{\%} confidence interval) of 0.91 (0.65-1.29), P = .67. CONCLUSIONS: Premedication using midazolam was not associated with higher incidence of delirium on the first postoperative day in older patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of short-term low-dose intravenous haloperidol for delirium prevention in critically ill elderly patients after noncardiac surgery. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial in two centers. SETTING: Intensive care units of two large tertiary teaching hospitals. PATIENTS: Four hundred fifty-seven patients 65 yrs or older who were admitted to the intensive care unit after noncardiac surgery. INTERVENTION: Haloperidol (0.5 mg intravenous bolus injection followed by continuous infusion at a rate of 0.1 mg/h for 12 hrs; n = 229) or placebo (n = 228) was randomly administered from intensive care unit admission. MEASURES: The primary end point was the incidence of delirium within the first 7 days after surgery. Secondary end points included time to onset of delirium, number of delirium-free days, length of intensive care unit stay, all-cause 28-day mortality, and adverse events. Delirium was assessed using the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit. RESULTS: The incidence of delirium during the first 7 days after surgery was 15.3{\%} (35/229) in the haloperidol group and 23.2{\%} (53/228) in the control group (p = .031). The mean time to onset of delirium and the mean number of delirium-free days were significantly longer (6.2 days {$[$}95{\%} confidence interval 5.9-6.4{$]$} vs. 5.7 days {$[$}95{\%} confidence interval 5.4-6.0{$]$}; p = .021; and 6.8 +/- 0.5 days vs. 6.7 +/- 0.8 days; p = .027, respectively), whereas the median length of intensive care unit stay was significantly shorter (21.3 hrs {$[$}95{\%} confidence interval 20.3-22.2{$]$} vs. 23.0 hrs {$[$}95{\%} confidence interval 20.9-25.1{$]$}; p = .024) in the haloperidol group than in the control group. There was no significant difference with regard to all-cause 28-day mortality between the two groups (0.9{\%} {$[$}2/229{$]$} vs. 2.6{\%} {$[$}6/228{$]$}; p = .175). No drug-related side effects were documented. CONCLUSIONS: For elderly patients admitted to intensive care unit after noncardiac surgery, short-term prophylactic administration of low-dose intravenous haloperidol significantly decreased the incidence of postoperative delirium.

@article{4888,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium continues to pose major clinical difficulties. While unmodifiable factors (e.g. age and comorbidity burden) are commonly studied risk factors for delirium, the role of modifiable factors, such as anaesthesia type and commonly used perioperative medications, remains understudied. This study aims to evaluate the role of modifiable factors for delirium after hip and knee arthroplasties. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of 41 766 patients who underwent hip or knee arthroplasties between 2005 and 2014 at a single institution. Data were collected as part of routine patient care. Multivariable logistic regression models assessed associations between anaesthesia type and commonly used perioperative medications (opioids, benzodiazepines, and ketamine) and postoperative delirium. Odds ratios (OR) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) are reported. Various sensitivity analyses are also considered, including multiple imputation methods to address missing data. RESULTS: Postoperative delirium occurred in 2.21{\%} (n=922) of all patients. While patients who received neuraxial anaesthesia were at lower risk for postoperative delirium (compared with general anaesthesia; epidural OR 0.59 CI 0.38-0.93; spinal OR 0.55 CI 0.37-0.83; combined spinal/epidural OR 0.56 CI 0.40-0.80), those given intraoperative ketamine (OR 1.27 CI 1.01-1.59), opioids (OR 1.25 CI 1.09-1.44), postoperative benzodiazepines (OR 2.47 CI 2.04-2.97), and ketamine infusion (OR 10.59 CI 5.26-19.91) were at a higher risk. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of hip and knee arthroplasty patients, anaesthesia type and perioperative medications were associated with increased odds for postoperative delirium. Our results support the notion that modifiable risk factors may exacerbate or attenuate risk for postoperative delirium.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiopulmonary bypass initiates a systemic inflammatory response syndrome that is associated with postoperative morbidity and mortality. Steroids suppress inflammatory responses and might improve outcomes in patients at high risk of morbidity and mortality undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. We aimed to assess the effects of steroids in patients at high risk of morbidity and mortality undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. METHODS: The Steroids In caRdiac Surgery (SIRS) study is a double-blind, randomised, controlled trial. We used a central computerised phone or interactive web system to randomly assign (1:1) patients at high risk of morbidity and mortality from 80 hospital or cardiac surgery centres in 18 countries undergoing cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass to receive either methylprednisolone (250 mg at anaesthetic induction and 250 mg at initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass) or placebo. Patients were assigned with block randomisation with random block sizes of 2, 4, or 6 and stratified by centre. Patients aged 18 years or older were eligible if they had a European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation of at least 6. Patients were excluded if they were taking or expected to receive systemic steroids in the immediate postoperative period or had a history of bacterial or fungal infection in the preceding 30 days. Patients, caregivers, and those assessing outcomes were masked to allocation. The primary outcomes were 30-day mortality and a composite of death and major morbidity (ie, myocardial injury, stroke, renal failure, or respiratory failure) within 30 days, both analysed by intention to treat. Safety outcomes were also analysed by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00427388. FINDINGS: Patients were recruited between June 21, 2007, and Dec 19, 2013. Complete 30-day data was available for all 7507 patients randomly assigned to methylprednisolone (n=3755) and to placebo (n=3752). Methylprednisolone, compared with placebo, did not reduce the risk of death at 30 days (154 {$[$}4{\%}{$]$} vs 177 {$[$}5{\%}{$]$} patients; relative risk {$[$}RR{$]$} 0.87, 95{\%} CI 0.70-1.07, p=0.19) or the risk of death or major morbidity (909 {$[$}24{\%}{$]$} vs 885 {$[$}24{\%}{$]$}; RR 1.03, 95{\%} CI 0.95-1.11, p=0.52). The most common safety outcomes in the methylprednisolone and placebo group were infection (465 {$[$}12{\%}{$]$} vs 493 {$[$}13{\%}{$]$}), surgical site infection (151 {$[$}4{\%}{$]$} vs 151 {$[$}4{\%}{$]$}), and delirium (295 {$[$}8{\%}{$]$} vs 289 {$[$}8{\%}{$]$}). INTERPRETATION: Methylprednisolone did not have a significant effect on mortality or major morbidity after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. The SIRS trial does not support the routine use of methylprednisolone for patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. FUNDING: Canadian Institutes of Health Research.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preoperative administration of methylprednisolone reduced circulating markers of endothelial activation. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was to evaluate whether a single preoperative dose of methylprednisolone reduced the rate of postoperative delirium (POD) in older patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery and its association with the shedding of endothelial glycocalyx markers. METHODS: About 168 patients, aged 65-80 years and scheduled for laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery, were randomized to 2 mg/kg methylprednisolone (Group M, n = 84) or equivalent dose of placebo (Group C, n = 84). The primary outcome was the incidence of delirium during the first 5 days after surgery, assessed by the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). POD severity was rated daily using CAM-Severity (CAM-S). Levels of syndecan-1, heparan sulfate, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were measured at baseline, 1 day, and 3 days after surgery. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, methylprednisolone greatly reduced the incidence of delirium at 72 hours following surgery (9 {$[$}10.7{\%}{$]$} vs 20 {$[$}23.8{\%}{$]$}, p = .03, OR = 2.22 {$[$}95{\%} CI 1.05-4.59{$]$}). No between-group difference was found in the cumulative CAM-S score (p = .14). The levels of heparan sulfate, syndecan-1, and TNF-alpha in Group M were lower than that in Group C (p < .05 and p < .01), while the level of BDNF in Group M was higher than that in Group C (p < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative administration of methylprednisolone does not reduce the severity of POD, but may reduce the incidence of delirium after gastrointestinal surgery in older patients, which may be related to a reduction in circulating markers of endothelial degradation, followed by the increase of BDNF level.

@article{10090,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hepatectomy is a highly invasive procedure with a high probability of postoperative delirium. Treatment with antiulcer drugs is indispensable after hepatectomy for anastomotic ulcer management. The clinical pathway for hepatectomy was reviewed and the antiulcer drug used was switched from famotidine, a H2-receptor antagonist, to omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, owing to the pharmacist's intervention. METHODS: Hepatectomized recipients over 65 years of age, except in the cases of laparoscopic surgery and intensive care unit entry, were treated with famotidine injections (10 patients) or omeprazole injections (11 patients), and the incidence rates and severity of delirium were compared between the famotidine and omeprazole groups. The delirium after hepatectomy was assessed using the Japanese version of the NEECHAM confusion scale. RESULTS: The incidence rates of delirium were 90{\%} in the famotidine group and 27.3{\%} in the omeprazole group. Four out of 9 recipients in the famotidine group were injected with haloperidol to treat for delirium, but no recipients needed this treatment in the omeprazole group. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with famotidine, the use of omeprazole was found to be effective in reducing the incidence rate and severity of postoperative delirium in patients undergoing hepatectomy. Pharmacists should actively strive to mitigate the risks of delirium.},

@article{18927,
	abstract = {Background: Postoperative delirium is common in older adult patients and associated with a poor prognosis. The use of benzodia-zepine was identified as an independent risk factor for delirium, but there is no randomized controlled trial regarding the relationship between remimazolam, a new ultra-short acting benzodiazepine, and postoperative delirium. We designed a randomized controlled trial to evaluate if remimazolam increases the incidence of postoperative delirium compared with propofol in older adult patients undergoing orthopedic surgery with general anesthesia. Patients and Methods: We enrolled 320 patients aged more than 60 with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I--III who underwent orthopedic surgery. Patients were randomized to two groups to receive intraoperative remimazolam or propofol, respectively. Our primary outcome was the incidence of delirium within 3 days after surgery. Secondary outcome was emergence quality including the incidence of emergence agitation, extubation time, and length of post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) stay. Adverse events were also recorded. Results: The incidence of postoperative delirium was 15.6{\%} in the remimazolam group and 12.4{\%} in the propofol group (Risk ratio, 1.26; 95{\%} CI, 0.72 to 2.21; Risk difference, 3.2{\%}; 95{\%} CI, −4.7{\%} to 11.2{\%}; P = 0.42). No significant differences were observed for time of delirium onset, duration of delirium, and delirium subtype between the two groups. Patients in remimazolam group had a lower incidence of hypotension after induction and consumed less vasoactive drugs intraoperatively, but had a longer postoperative extubation time and PACU stay. Conclusion: General anesthesia with remimazolam was not associated with an increased incidence of postoperative delirium compared with propofol in older adult patients undergoing orthopedic surgery.},

	abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the association between the intraoperative administration of midazolam and the incidence of postoperative delirium in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Design: Retrospective observational cohort study. Setting: The Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination database. Participants: Patients aged 65 years and older who underwent cardiovascular surgery (excluding transcatheter surgeries, multiple surgeries per admission, and preoperative delirium) between April 1, 2015, and October 31, 2019. Measurements and Main Results: Patients who received midazolam (midazolam group) were compared with those who did not receive midazolam (no midazolam group). The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative delirium. The secondary outcomes were the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, mortality, and duration of intensive care unit stay and hospitalization. Propensity scores were estimated using logistic regression based on the covariates. The outcomes were compared using stabilized inverse probability of treatment-weighting analyses. Among the 16,185 patients analyzed, 10,633 (65.7{\%}) received midazolam. No significant differences were observed in the incidences of postoperative delirium (odds ratio {$[$}OR{$]$} 0.95; 95{\%} CI 0.87-1.03; p = 0.21) and hospital mortality (OR 0.92; 95{\%} CI 0.76-1.11; p = 0.39) between the groups; however, the midazolam group had slightly longer durations of intensive care unit stay (3.5 {$[$}3.5-3.6{$]$} v 3.3 {$[$}3.3-3.4{$]$} days, p < 0.001) and hospitalization (31.5 {$[$}31.1-31.9{$]$} v 29.4 {$[$}28.8-29.9{$]$} days, p < 0.001), and slightly lower incidences of postoperative nausea and vomiting (OR 0.92; 95{\%} CI 0.85-0.99; p = 0.03). The sensitivity analyses supported these results. Conclusions: Intraoperative administration of midazolam may not induce postoperative delirium in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.},

	abstract = {Objective: This study compared the post-anesthesia delirium in elderly patients treated with Dexmedetomidine and Midazolam Maleate after thoracic surgery. Methods: A total of 92 elderly patients treated with thoracic surgery in our hospital from June to September 2015 were selected. Digital random method was used to equally divide them into group A (n=46) and group B (n=46). Both groups were given with a continuous intravenous pumping of fentanyl for analgesia. Dexmedetomidine for group A and Midazolam Maleate for group B, and the delirium occurrence rates of patients in the two groups after the surgery were compared. Results: Awaking time 4.92 $\pm$1.18 min, breathing recovery time 10.53 $\pm$2.25 min, and extubation time 11.36 $\pm$2.63 min of patients in group A were significantly shorter than those in group B (P<0.05). Postoperative delirium occurrence rate of 6.52{\%} in group A was significantly lower than that in the control group, and the difference between the two groups had statistical significance (P<0.05). Difference between two groups before surgery in Mini-Mental State Evaluation (MMSE) scores was not significant without statistical significance (P>0.05). The MMSE scores 27.01 $\pm$0.46, 27.22 $\pm$0.50, 27.73 $\pm$0.54 and 28.62 $\pm$0.63 of patients in group A and 6 h and 1, 2 and 3 d after the surgery were significantly higher than those in the control group, and comparative difference between the two groups had statistical significance (P<0.05). In comparison between group A and group B in visual analog scale scores at time nodes before induction, after intubation, and upon surgery completion, the difference did not have statistical significance (P>0.05). Conclusion: Dexmedetomidine can improve the postoperative cognitive functions of elderly patients treated with thoracic surgery and reduce postoperative delirium.},

	abstract = {Study objective: To evaluate the association between midazolam premedication and postoperative delirium in a large retrospective cohort of patients ≥70 years. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: A single tertiary academic medical center. Patients: Patients ≥70 years having elective non-cardiac surgery under general anesthesia from 2020 to 2021. Interventions: Midazolam premedication, defined as intravenous midazolam administration prior to induction of general anesthesia. Measurements: The primary outcome, postoperative delirium, was a collapsed composite outcome including at least one of the following: a positive 4A's test during post-anesthesia care unit stay and/or the initial 2 postoperative days; physician or nursing records reporting new-onset confusion as captured by the CHART-DEL instrument; or a positive 3D-CAM test. The association between midazolam premedication and postoperative delirium was assessed using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounding variables. As secondary analysis, we investigated the association between midazolam premedication and a composite of other postoperative complications. Several sensitivity analyses were performed using similar regression models. Main results: In total, 1973 patients were analyzed (median age 75 years, 47{\%} women, 50{\%} ASA score ≥3, 32{\%} high risk surgery). The overall incidence of postoperative delirium was 15.3{\%} (302/1973). Midazolam premedication was administered to 782 (40{\%}) patients (median {$[$}IQR{$]$} dose 2 {$[$}1,2{$]$} mg). After adjustment for potential confounding variables, midazolam premedication was not associated with increased odds of postoperative delirium, with adjusted odds ratio of 1.09 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.82--1.45; P = 0.538). Midazolam premedication was also not associated with the composite of other postoperative complications. Furthermore, no association was found between midazolam premedication and postoperative delirium in any of the sensitivity analyses preformed. Conclusions: Our results suggest that low doses of midazolam can be safely used to pre-medicate elective surgical patients 70 years or older before non-cardiac surgery, without significant effect on the risk of developing postoperative delirium.},

	abstract = {Objective: Both adductor canal block (ACB) and infiltration between the popliteal artery and capsule of the knee (iPACK) block are mainly sensory blocks, preserving muscle strength and the ability to ambulate. This study was designed to evaluate whether adding dexamethasone to ropivacaine could improve postoperative analgesia after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Materials and Methods: This prospective double-blind randomized controlled trial included 60 patients who underwent unilateral TKA under general anesthesia. All patients who received ACB and iPACK block were randomly divided into a dexamethasone group (Group D, ropivacaine combined with dexamethasone) and a control group (Group C, ropivacaine only). The primary outcome was the time to first administration of rescue analgesic drugs. The secondary outcomes included the total amount of rescue analgesic drugs and the pain scores at different time points within 72 hours postoperatively; the time to first getting out of bed; the quality of recovery scale (QOR-15 score); and the levels of plasma inflammatory markers (interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein) on postoperative day 1. Results: Compared with Group C, the time to first administration of rescue analgesic drugs in Group D was significantly extended by ∼10.5 hours. Patients in Group D had significantly lower pain scores at different postoperative time points and consumed significantly less total morphine within 72 hours postoperatively. In addition, patients in group D reported significantly higher QoR-15 scores on postoperative days 1 and 3, earlier first time of getting out of bed, and significantly lower levels of C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 on postoperative day 1. Conclusions: Compared with using ropivacaine alone, ultrasonic-guided ACB combined with iPACK using ropivacaine and dexamethasone could prolong the duration of postoperative analgesia and strength analgesic intensity and promote the early rehabilitation exercise of patients undergoing TKA.},

	abstract = {Effect of flurbiprofen on the postoperative cognition and inflammatory cytokines in elderly patients after hip arthroplasty was investigated. Elderly patients undergoing replacement of total hip were randomly divided into three groups of equal size (n=60). A control group (control) received no treatment before or at the end of surgery. The other two groups, PRE and INTRA, received 50 mg flurbiprofen intravenously 15 min before the surgery and 30 min before the end of surgery, respectively. The pain score was evaluated by a visual analog scale (VAS) at the following time-points: 24 h before surgery (T0), and 3 h (T1), 12 h (T2) and 24 h (T3) after surgery. Peripheral venous blood was collected at T0, T1, T2 and T3. Cognitive function was assessed by mini-mental state examination (MMSE) at the time of T0, T1, T2 and T3. The serum concentration of tumor necrosis factor α(TNF-α), interleukin-1β(IL-1β), IL-6, and Cox-2 were measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The VAS scores and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the PRE and INTRA groups were less than those in the control group at T1, T2 and T3. The MMSE scores in PRE and INTRA groups were significantly higher than those in the control group at T1, T2 and T3. The PRE group showed a lower VAS score, release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and higher MMSE scores at T1, T2 and T3 than the control and INTRA groups. Intravenous flurbiprofen administration reduces postoperative pain and flammatory response after hip arthroplasty. Moreover, flurbiprofen is more effective when given preoperatively than intraoperatively.},

@article{5765,
	abstract = {Objective: Inflammation plays a key role in the etiology and pathology of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor celecoxib is used for the treatment of acute pain due to its potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. Herein, we evaluated the effects of celecoxib on POCD in geriatric patients. Methods: A total of 178 geriatric patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty were randomly divided into two groups and treated with celecoxib (group C) or placebo (group P). The levels of perioperative plasma COX-2, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, neuron-specific enolase, and S100βwere detected in all patients. The pain intensity was measured by numerical rating scale (NRS). A battery of 9 neuropsychological tests was performed pre-operatively and 1 week, and 3 months postoperatively. Patients, whose postoperative performance declined by ≧1 standard deviation as compared to each preoperative test score on ≧2 tests, were classified as POCD. Results: A significant decrease in POCD incidence was found in group C as compared to group P on postoperative day 7 (12.3{\%} vs. 34.1{\%}; p < 0.05). POCD incidence did not differ between the two groups at the 3-month follow-up (8.8 vs. 9.7{\%}). NRS scores at days 3 and 4 post-surgery were significantly lower in group C (p < 0.05). Patients in group C showed lower level of plasma COX-2, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and S100βas compared to group P postoperatively (p < 0.05). Conclusion: These results demonstrated that celecoxib can decrease early POCD incidence after total knee arthroplasty in geriatric patients, which might be mediated by suppressing inflammation and acute postoperative pain caused by surgical trauma.
