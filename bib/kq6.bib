	abstract = {Background: delirium is a common complication after cardiac surgical procedures and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Postoperative delirium is associated with an increased length of stay in the intensive care unit, long hospital stay and high hospital charges. Aim of the Work: to investigate the effectiveness of melatonin as a preoperative sedative as well as the preventive and the curative effect of melatonin supplementation in elderly patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery on postoperative delirium. Patients and Methods: this prospective, randomized, controlled, double blind study was conducted on a total of 50 patients allocated into 2 equal groups. It was conducted in Ain Shams University hospitals, in the cardiothoracic surgery unit. Results: melatonin has superior sedative effect at 30 min preoperatively compared with placebo (P=0.022). Melatonin succeeded to treat about 56{\%} of delirious patients. The incidence of delirium was 8{\%} in the melatonin group vs. 28{\%} in the control group (P= 0.046). In univariate analysis, predictors of delirium in both groups were age (P= 0.049 in melatonin group, P=0.021 in control group), higher fentanyl dose (P= 0.021 in melatonin group, P=0.047 in control group), lower ejection fraction (P= 0.018 in melatonin group, P=0.008 in control group), longer cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) times (P= 0.026 in melatonin group, P=0.04 in control group) and longer aortic cross clamping (ACC) times (P= 0.04 in melatonin group, P=0.019 in control group). Conclusion: administration of melatonin significantly decreased the incidence of postoperative delirium (POD) after coronary artery bypass grafting in elderly patients and significantly increased preoperative sedation. Advanced age, higher total intraoperative fentanyl dose, lower ejection fraction and longer CPB and ACC times were independent predictors of POD with or without melatonin supplementation.},

@article{17055,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative neurological injuries, including cognitive dysfunction, sleep disorder, delirium, and anxiety, are the important consequences of coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Evidence has shown that postoperative sleep disturbance is partly due to disturbed melatonin secretion in the perioperative period. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of melatonin on postoperative sleep disorder in patients undergoing CABG. METHOD: One hundred forty-five elective CABG patients participated in a randomized double-blind study during the preoperative period. The patients were randomized to receive either 3 mg of melatonin or 10 mg of Oxazepam one hour before sleep time. Each group received the medication from 3 days before surgery until the time of discharge. Sleep quality was evaluated using the Groningen Sleep Quality Score (GSQS), and the incidence of delirium was evaluated by nursing records. Sleep quality and anxiety scores were compared before and after surgery through the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and independent t-test were used to compare the sleep and anxiety scores between the groups. P values </= 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Totally, 137 patients at a mean age of 60 years completed the study (76{\%} male). The analysis of the data showed that sleep was significantly disturbed after surgery in both groups. The patients in the Oxazepam group demonstrated significantly higher disturbance in their mean postoperative GSQS score than did their counterparts in the melatonin group (p value < 0.001). A smaller proportion of the participants experienced delirium in the melatonin group (0.06{\%}) than in the Oxazepam group (0.12{\%}); however, this difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The result of the present study revealed that melatonin improved sleep in post-cardiac surgery patients more than what was observed with Oxazepam. Therefore, melatonin may be considered an effective alternative for Benzodiazepines in the management of postoperative sleep disorder.},

@article{17019,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The delirium-sparing effect of nighttime dexmedetomidine has not been studied after surgery. We hypothesised that a nighttime dose of dexmedetomidine would reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium as compared to placebo. METHODS: This single-centre, parallel-arm, randomised, placebo-controlled superiority trial evaluated whether a short nighttime dose of intravenous dexmedetomidine (1 Î¼g/kg over 40 min) would reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium in patients 60 years of age or older undergoing elective cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients were randomised to receive dexmedetomidine or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome was delirium on postoperative day one. Secondary outcomes included delirium within three days of surgery, 30-, 90-, and 180-day abbreviated Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores, Patient Reported Outcome Measures Information System quality of life scores, and all-cause mortality. The study was registered as NCT02856594 on ClinicalTrials.gov on August 5, 2016, before the enrolment of any participants. FINDINGS: Of 469 patients that underwent randomisation to placebo (n = 235) or dexmedetomidine (n = 234), 75 met a prespecified drop criterion before the study intervention. Thus, 394 participants (188 dexmedetomidine; 206 placebo) were analysed in the modified intention-to-treat cohort (median age 69 {$[$}IQR 64, 74{$]$} years; 73.1{\%} male {$[$}n = 288{$]$}; 26Â·9{\%} female {$[$}n = 106{$]$}). Postoperative delirium status on day one was missing for 30 (7.6{\%}) patients. Among those in whom it could be assessed, the primary outcome occurred in 5 of 175 patients (2.9{\%}) in the dexmedetomidine group and 16 of 189 patients (8.5{\%}) in the placebo group (OR 0.32, 95{\%} CI: 0.10-0.83; P = 0.029). A non-significant but higher proportion of participants experienced delirium within three days postoperatively in the placebo group (25/177; 14.1{\%}) compared to the dexmedetomidine group (14/160; 8.8{\%}; OR 0.58; 95{\%} CI, 0.28-1.15). No significant differences between groups were observed in secondary outcomes or safety. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggested that in elderly cardiac surgery patients with a low baseline risk of postoperative delirium and extubated within 12 h of ICU admission, a short nighttime dose of dexmedetomidine decreased the incidence of delirium on postoperative day one. Although non-statistically significant, our findings also suggested a clinical meaningful difference in the three-day incidence of postoperative delirium.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delirium is a critical postoperative complication in older patients. Based on the hypothesis that intraoperative dexmedetomidine sedation would lower postoperative delirium than propofol sedation would, the authors compared the incidence of postoperative delirium in older adults, using the mentioned sedatives. METHODS: This double-blinded, randomized controlled study included 748 patients, aged 65 yr or older, who were scheduled for elective lower extremity orthopedic surgery, between June 2017 and October 2021. Patients were randomized equally into two groups in a 1:1 ratio according to the intraoperative sedative used (dexmedetomidine vs. propofol). The postoperative delirium incidence was considered the primary outcome measure; it was determined using the confusion assessment method, on the first three postoperative days. The mean arterial pressure and heart rate were evaluated as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: The authors enrolled 732 patients in the intention-to-treat analyses. The delirium incidence was lower in the dexmedetomidine group than in the propofol group (11 {$[$}3.0{\%}{$]$} vs. 24 {$[$}6.6{\%}{$]$}; odds ratio, 0.42; 95{\%} CI, 0.201 to 0.86; P = 0.036). During sedation, the mean arterial pressure (median {$[$}interquartile range{$]$} mmHg) was higher in the dexmedetomidine group (77 {$[$}71 to 84{$]$}) than in the propofol group (74 {$[$}69 to 79{$]$}; P < 0.001); however, it significantly fell lower (74 {$[$}68 to 80{$]$}) than that of the propofol group (80 {$[$}74 to 87{$]$}) in the postanesthesia care unit (P < 0.001). Lower heart rates (beats/min) were recorded with the use of dexmedetomidine than with propofol, both during sedation (60 {$[$}55 to 66{$]$} vs. 63 {$[$}58 to 70{$]$}) and in the postanesthesia care unit (64 {$[$}58 to 72{$]$} vs. 68 {$[$}62-77{$]$}; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Dexmedetomidine showed a lower incidence of postoperative delirium than propofol in healthy older adults undergoing lower extremity orthopedic surgery.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to determine whether perioperative dexmedetomidine administration can improve postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing oral and maxillofacial surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial conducted in Cangzhou Central Hospital from December 2021 to March 2022. Patients aged 65 and older underwent oral and maxillofacial surgery under general anesthesia. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to dexmedetomidine or control group. Dexmedetomidine was injected intravenously from 10 min before induction of anesthesia to 30 min before the end of surgery in dexmedetomidine group, while patients in the control group were given normal saline at the same rate during the same time period. The primary measurement indicators were the incidence and duration of delirium in the first five days after surgery. The secondary measurement indicators were Visual Analogue Score (VAS) for the first 24 hours following surgery, subjective sleep quality score within 24 hours postoperatively and intraoperative adverse reactions. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty patients were randomly assigned. Baseline characteristics were similar between two groups. The incidence and duration of postoperative delirium did not differ statistically between two groups (all P > 0.05). Compared with control group, VAS scores in dexmedetomidine group were significantly lower at 6, 12, and 24 hours after surgery (all P < 0.05); moreover, Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ) results were significantly improved 1 day after surgery in dexmedetomidine group (P < 0.05). Dexmedetomidine-related adverse reactions were similar in both groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine 10 min before induction of anesthesia to half an hour before the end of surgery did not improve postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing oral and maxillofacial surgery; however, dexmedetomidine may be associated with decreased postoperative pain and improved postoperative sleep quality.},

	abstract = {In order to investigate the effects of Dexmedetomidine (DEX) on postoperative anesthesia recovery time and consciousness function in elderly patients with laparoscopic colorectal tumors, 40 patients (20 in the control group and 20 in the DEX group) were selected. The DEX group was intravenously pumped at a rate of 0.8 Î¼g/kg/h for 10 min and then continuously pumped at a rate of 0.3 Î¼g/kg/h until 40 min before the end of the operation. The two groups were given the same amount of normal saline, with the same way of anesthesia. The results showed that the visual analog scale (VAS) score of pain in the two groups decreased signally. Compared with the control group, the inflammatory factors tumor necrosis factor (TNF-Î±), interleukin-1Î²(IL-1Î²), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP-2) in the DEX group were remarkably decreased at T1 and T2 stages, with a considerable difference (P < 0.05). One month after the auxiliary diagnosis of colorectal tumor, no clear nodular, irregular shape patches, or patchy diffuse limited points were found, which indicated that the whole tumor had been removed. In summary, DEX could improve postoperative cognitive function in elderly patients who underwent the laparoscopic radical resection of colon cancer, and its mechanism was related to the reduction of inflammatory factors. Therefore, the anesthesia intervention with DEX during the operation had a positive significance for tumor resection.},

METHODS: A blinded, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study was performed on 60 patients (age range 65-74 years) undergoing lobectomy by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (29 in the dexmedetomidine group; 31 in the placebo group). Dexmedetomidine group patients received dexmedetomidine, and placebo group patients received an equal volume of physiological saline 20 minutes before anesthesia induction. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment 1 day before surgery and on postoperative day (POD)1, POD3, and POD7. The regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO(2)) was monitored continuously by near-infrared spectroscopy before anesthesia. RESULTS: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was significantly different between the two groups on POD1 (dexmedetomidine 26.4  $\pm$0.73 vs. placebo 25.5 $\pm$0.96) and POD3 (dexmedetomidine 27.1 $\pm$0.79 vs. placebo 26.6 $\pm$0.80). Specifically, attention and orientation scores were increased in the dexmedetomidine group on POD1 and POD3. The rSO(2) was not significantly different between the dexmedetomidine and placebo groups. CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine given before induction of anesthesia could reduce the risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction and might not decrease rSO(2). Hence, dexmedetomidine could be employed in pulmonary surgical procedures, especially for older patients with a high risk of cognitive dysfunction.},

	abstract = {The stimulation of tracheal extraction and anesthesia may lead to early postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in elderly patients, especially within 72 h after surgery, due to the insufficient compensatory and regulatory effects of their cardiovascular system. This study was performed to demonstrate the effects of additional dexmedetomidine (DEX) administration on alleviating early POCD (72 h post intubation) and inflammation in elderly patients who underwent intubation. A parallel-randomized trial was performed in this study. A total of 100 patients aged 60-85 years were randomly divided into two groups (DEX, n = 50; control, n = 50). They received traditional anesthesia and additional DEX medications. Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) were used to assess the cognitive dysfunction of patients. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the stress and inflammatory response of the two groups of patients. Administration of DEX significantly improved the MMSE and MoCA scores 24 and 72 h post operation. The S100Î²and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) levels in serum were downregulated by DEX 6 and 24 h post operation. The norepinephrine and cortisol levels in serum were downregulated by DEX 15 and 30 min post operation. The interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor Î±(TNF-Î±) levels in serum were also downregulated by DEX 15 and 30 min post operation. DEX alleviated POCD and inflammation in elderly patients who underwent intubation.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of dexmedetomidine in reducing the occurrence of postoperative delirium in elderly patients after total hip joint replacement. METHODS: Patients who have undergone total hip joint replacement and who were admitted to the hospital from August 1, 2017, to August 1, 2020, were included in this study. After initial screening, 327 out of 385 patients were selected and randomly assigned to either dexmedetomidine (0.1 Î¼g/kg/h, n=163) or placebo (n=164) groups. The occurrence of delirium was examined twice a day for one week by using the Confusion Assessment Method. Furthermore, 30-day all-cause mortality, hospitalization duration and costs, and the presence of any postoperative complications were also evaluated. RESULTS: The postoperative delirium incidence was significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group compared to that in the placebo group (13.8 vs. 29.3{\%}, p<0.01). The hospitalization duration (17.2$\pm$6.3 vs. 15.6$\pm$4.2, p=0.006) and cost (4.5$\pm$0.9 vs. 4.9$\pm$1.1, p=0.001) in the dexmedetomidine group were also lower than those in the placebo group. Meanwhile, no significant difference between the 30-day all-cause mortality of the two groups was observed (p=0.60). In terms of safety, no significant differences between the occurrence of hypotension and bradycardia were also observed. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that the dexmedetomidine medication can reduce the postoperative delirium incidence in older total hip joint replacement patients and can subsequently decrease the related hospitalization duration and cost of these patients.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Delirium is a serious medical condition with increased incidence in at-risk surgical populations. We sought to determine if melatonin use reduces the incidence of delirium in individuals undergoing major cardiac surgery. DESIGN: Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial (two arms, 1:1 allocation, parallel design). SETTING: The trial took place in two metropolitan hospitals (public tertiary and private) in Perth, Western Australia. PARTICIPANTS: We recruited 210 adults aged 50 years or older who were due to undergo coronary artery bypass grafting or valve replacement surgery. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to 7 days of treatment with melatonin 3 mg at night or matching placebo, starting 2 days before the surgery. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome of interest was incident delirium within 7 days of surgery as assessed via daily clinical assessment that included the Confusion Assessment Method. Secondary outcomes of interest included duration and severity of delirium, length of hospital stay, cognitive function, and mood and anxiety symptoms at discharge and 3 months after the surgery. RESULTS: The groups were well balanced for demographic and clinical parameters. Forty-two participants developed delirium, but it was evenly distributed between the groups (melatonin 21/98, 21.4{\%}; placebo 21/104, 20.2{\%}; adjusted odds ratio {$[$}OR{$]$} = .78; 95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$} = .35-1.75). The median duration of delirium was 3 (interquartile range {$[$}IQR{$]$} = 2-4) and 2 (IQR = 1-3) days for people treated with melatonin and placebo, respectively (z = -1.03; P = .304). A similar proportion of participants experienced severe episodes of delirium in each group (melatonin 9/21, 42.9{\%} vs placebo 6/21, 28.6{\%}; Ï(2) = .93; P = .334; adjusted OR = 1.98; 95{\%} CI = .40-9.78). The groups did not differ in terms of length of stay, mood, anxiety, and cognitive performance. CONCLUSION: The findings of this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial do not support the prophylactic use of melatonin to prevent delirium after major cardiac surgery.

@article{16552,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Disturbance of the sleep-wake cycle is a characteristic of delirium. In addition, changes in melatonin rhythm influence the circadian rhythm and are associated with delirium. We compared the effect of melatonin and placebo on the incidence and duration of delirium. METHODS: We performed this multicentre, double-blind, randomized controlled trial between November 2008 and May 2012 in 1 academic and 2 nonacademic hospitals. Patients aged 65 years or older who were scheduled for acute hip surgery were eligible for inclusion. Patients received melatonin 3 mg or placebo in the evening for 5 consecutive days, starting within 24 hours after admission. The primary outcome was incidence of delirium within 8 days of admission. We also monitored the duration of delirium. RESULTS: A total of 452 patients were randomly assigned to the 2 study groups. We subsequently excluded 74 patients for whom the primary end point could not be measured or who had delirium before the second day of the study. After these postrandomization exclusions, data for 378 patients were included in the main analysis. The overall mean age was 84 years, 238 (63.0{\%}) of the patients lived at home before admission, and 210 (55.6{\%}) had cognitive impairment. We observed no effect of melatonin on the incidence of delirium: 55/186 (29.6{\%}) in the melatonin group v. 49/192 (25.5{\%}) in the placebo group; difference 4.1 (95{\%} confidence interval -0.05 to 13.1) percentage points. There were no between-group differences in mortality or in cognitive or functional outcomes at 3-month follow-up. INTERPRETATION: In this older population with hip fracture, treatment with melatonin did not reduce the incidence of delirium.

Methods: Atotal of 100 patients, 42 male and 58 female, ages 60 to 85 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade I or II, who were undergoing total hip arthroplasty were randomly divided into 2 groups: A dexmedetomidine group (group D; n = 50) and a control group (group C; n=50). Group D patients were infused with 0.3 lg kg1 h1 of dexmedetomidine from 5 minutes prior to anesthesia induction until the end of surgery. Group C patients received an equal volume of saline. Heart rate and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were recorded before anesthesia induction (T0), 1 minute before extubation (T1), and 30 minutes after extubation (T2). The Visual Analog Score (VAS) at 1, 2, and 3 days after surgery, the incidence and duration of postoperative delirium, and the length of hospital stay were recorded. Adverse reactions, such as nausea, vomiting, and lethargy, were also recorded. Results: The Visual Analog Scores in the 2 groups were similar. In group D, there was no significant difference in heart rate (P = 0.232) and MAP (P = 0.056) between T0 and T1. However, in group C, heart rate significantly increased by 15.3 bpm (P = 0.000) and MAP significantly increased by 10.7 mmHg (P = 0.001) at T1 compared with those at T0. The incidence of postoperative delirium in group D (10{\%}) was significantly lower than that in group C (26{\%}; P=0.037). The duration of delirium in group D (1.3 6 0.6 days) was shorter than that in group C (3.0 6 0.5 days; P=0.000). The length of hospital stay in group D (13.2 6 0.9 days) was shorter than that in group C (16.1 6 0.7 days; P = 0.000). No significant differences were observed in adverse effects between the 2 groups. Conclusion: Intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine can not only reduce the incidence and duration of postoperative delirium, but also shorten the length of hospital stay in elderly patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty. {\copyright}2021 International College of Surgeons.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to examine the effect of dexmedetomidine for intraoperative sedation and postoperative cognitive function in patients with preoperative anxiety undergoing carotid artery stenting. METHODS: Eighty patients were randomly divided into two groups: the dexmedetomidine group and the control group. Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Anxiety was evaluated using the Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale. Routine monitoring indices were recorded during surgery, and cognitive function indices were recorded before drug infusion (T0), 10 minutes after drug infusion (T1), at the end of surgery (T2), and 6 hours after surgery (T3). RESULTS: The anxiety scores were not significantly different between the two groups at T0, but they became significantly different at T1-3. The MMSE scores in both groups increased at 1 and 7 days postoperatively; although the increase in the dexmedetomidine group was sharper, there was no significant difference. In both groups, the MMSE scores at 1 and 7 days after surgery were not significantly different from those at 1 day before surgery. CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine can improve patients' anxiety and achieve a sufficient sedation effect without causing postoperative cognitive dysfunction.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation and delirium are common consequences of cardiac surgery. Dexmedetomidine has unique properties as sedative agent and might reduce the risk of each complication. This study coprimarily aimed to establish whether dexmedetomidine reduces the incidence of new-onset atrial fibrillation and the incidence of delirium. METHODS: A randomised, placebo-controlled trial was done at six academic hospitals in the USA. Patients who had had cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1, stratified by site, to dexmedetomidine or normal saline placebo. Randomisation was computer generated with random permuted block size 2 and 4, and allocation was concealed by a web-based system. Patients, caregivers, and evaluators were all masked to treatment. The study drug was prepared by the pharmacy or an otherwise uninvolved research associate so that investigators and clinicians were fully masked to allocation. Participants were given either dexmedetomidine infusion or saline placebo started before the surgical incision at a rate of 0.1 mug/kg per h then increased to 0.2 mug/kg per h at the end of bypass, and postoperatively increased to 0.4 mug/kg per h, which was maintained until 24 h. The coprimary outcomes were atrial fibrillation and delirium occurring between intensive care unit admission and the earlier of postoperative day 5 or hospital discharge. All analyses were intention-to-treat. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02004613 and is closed. FINDINGS: 798 patients of 3357 screened were enrolled from April 17, 2013, to Dec 6, 2018. The trial was stopped per protocol after the last designated interim analysis. Among 798 patients randomly assigned, 794 were analysed, with 400 assigned to dexmedetomidine and 398 assigned to placebo. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was 121 (30{\%}) in 397 patients given dexmedetomidine and 134 (34{\%}) in 395 patients given placebo, a difference that was not significant: relative risk 0.90 (97.8{\%} CI 0.72, 1.15; p=0.34). The incidence of delirium was non-significantly increased from 12{\%} in patients given placebo to 17{\%} in those given dexmedetomidine: 1.48 (97.8{\%} CI 0.99-2.23). Safety outcomes were clinically important bradycardia (requiring treatment) and hypotension, myocardial infarction, stroke, surgical site infection, pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, and death. 21 (5{\%}) of 394 patients given dexmedetomidine and 8 (2{\%}) of 396 patients given placebo, had a serious adverse event as determined by clinicians. 1 (<1{\%}) of 391 patients given dexmedetomidine and 1 (<1{\%}) of 387 patients given placebo died. INTERPRETATION: Dexmedetomidine infusion, initiated at anaesthetic induction and continued for 24 h, did not decrease postoperative atrial arrhythmias or delirium in patients recovering from cardiac surgery. Dexmedetomidine should not be infused to reduce atrial fibrillation or delirium in patients having cardiac surgery. FUNDING: Hospira Pharmaceuticals.},

@article{15285,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence confirms that perioperative ketamine administration decreases opioid usage. To reduce the risk for potential psychodysleptic side effects, however, ketamine dosing tends to be limited to low-dose regimens. We hypothesized that even lower doses of ketamine would be sufficient, with minimal side effects, when used as a component of multimodal perioperative pain management. METHODS: In this triple-blinded, randomized, active- and placebo-controlled clinical trial, patients undergoing elective major abdominal surgery were randomized to one of three treatment groups: low-dose S-ketamine (a 0.25 mg/kg bolus and 0.125 mg/kg/h infusion for 48 hours), minimal-dose S-ketamine (a 0.015 mg/kg/h infusion following a saline bolus), and placebo (saline bolus and infusion). Opioid consumption, pain levels, hyperalgesia at the incision site, and delirium scores were assessed 48 h postoperatively. RESULTS: Patients in the placebo group had the highest cumulative piritramide consumption and the largest normalized areas of hyperalgesia at the incisional site, while those in the low-dose group had the highest delirium scores. Postoperative pain levels did not differ significantly between the treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that minimal-dose S-ketamine was comparable to the conventional low-dose regimen in reducing postoperative opioid consumption and hyperalgesia. Postoperative delirium, however, was less frequent with the minimal-dose regimen. We therefore suggest that minimal-dose S-ketamine may be a useful low-risk component of balanced perioperative analgesia.},

	abstract = {Background: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in elderly patients is a common complaint after prolonged surgeries. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of intraoperative infusion of Dexmedetomidine on POCD. Methods: 50 patients aged more than 60 years old undergoing elective abdominal surgery expected to last more than 2 hours were randomized into 2 groups of 25 patients each: Those receiving Dexmedetomidine at a dose of 0.4 lg/kg/h, group (A) and those receiving 0.9{\%} normal saline as placebo group (B). All patients underwent neuropsychometric tests (Montreal cognitive assessment and Stroop color word interference tests) the day before the surgery and 24 h after the surgery, and one week postoperatively. Results: The use of Dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant during Sevoflurane anesthesia did not have significant effect on protection against POCD in one day and one week postoperatively. The anesthetic and analgesic sparing effect of Dexmedetomidine was significantly proved by lower Sevoflurane need and significant lesser amount of total 24 hours postoperative Fentanyl requirements, but with significant prolonged extubation and orientation times in Dexmedetomidine group than placebo group. Conclusions: The findings of this pilot study suggest that intraoperative use of Dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant in major surgery in elderly patients was not associated with significant protection against POCD.},

	abstract = {The present study aimed to investigate the effects of dexmedetomidine (DEX) on cognition following a carotid endarterectomy (CEA). In addition, the neuroprotective effects of DEX against ischemia-reperfusion injury during CEA were analyzed. Patients due to undergo elective CEA under general anesthesia were randomly assigned to either the DEX-treated group (group D; n=25) or the control group (group C; n=25). Patients in group D were treated with 0.3 Î¼g/kg DEX pre-CEA, followed by 0.3 Î¼g/kg/h DEX intraoperatively up to 30 min prior to the completion of surgery, and the patients in group C received an equal volume of normal saline. Cognitive function was assessed prior to CEA (T0), and at 24, 48, and 72 h, 7 days and 1 month post-surgery (T1-5, respectively), using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Blood samples were drawn from the ipsilateral jugular bulb of all patients at 20 min prior to anesthesia (t0), and at 10 min following tracheal intubation, 15 min following clamping and unclamping of the carotid artery, and at 6 and 24 h postoperatively (t1-5, respectively). The protein expression levels of markers of cerebral ischemia and injury, namely S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and the concentration of the oxidative stress marker malondialdehyde (MDA), were analyzed. Patients in group D exhibited elevated MMSE scores at T2 and T3 post-CEA, as compared with group C. Furthermore, the protein expression level of S100B and the concentration of MDA in the jugular bulb of group D patients were markedly decreased compared with those in group C at t3-5 and t3, respectively. The results of the present study suggested that DEX was able to enhance the recovery of cognition following CEA, and this was associated with decreased cerebral damage and antioxidative effects.},

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate the effect of dexmedetomidine on the postoperative cognitive function of patients undergoing radical resection of esophageal cancer. Methods: A total of 76 patients undergoing radical resection of esophageal cancer were randomly and equally divided into observation and control groups. The patients in the two groups were then treated with continuous intravenous pumping of fentanyl to ease their pain. In the control group, the patients were initially treated with 0.05 mg/kg and then with 0.02-0.08 mg/kg*h-1 rhythim to remain anesthetized. In the observation group, the patients were intravenously infused with 1.0 Âµg/kg dexmedetomidine and then with 0.2-0.7 Âµg/kg*h-1 to retain their anesthetized conditions. The sedative effect and incidence of adverse reactions in these patients were compared. Results: The sedative effects did not significantly differ between the two groups (P>0.05). The recovery time after the drug was withdrawn from the patients in the observation group was significantly shorter than that in the control group (P<0.05). The incidence of adverse reactions in the observation group was 13.16{\%}, which was significantly lower than that in the control group (39.47{\%}; P<0.05). The postoperative SDS and SAS scores of the patients in the two groups were significantly higher than their preoperative scores (P<0.05). The postoperative SDS and SAS scores of the patients in the observation group were also significantly higher than those in the control group (P<0.05). Conclusion: The sedative effect of dexmedetomidine on patients subjected to general anesthesia and undergoing radical resection of esophageal cancer was good. Dexmedetomidine could improve the cognitive function of patients and reduce the incidence of adverse reactions. Therefore, this drug should be recommended for these patients.},

@article{13630,
	abstract = {Background: Experimental evidence has indicated the benefits of dexmedetomidine for the treatment of postoperative delirium. Previously clinical trials have had no definite conclusions concerning dexmedetomidine on delirium, while some studies have shown it can reduce delirium. One study showed it cannot improve outcomes. The present study, therefore, explored whether acute dexmedetomidine treatment could reduce incidence of delirium and improve clinical outcomes. Methods: This was a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial in three hospitals in Jiangsu and Anhui, China. This study enrolled patients aged more than 60 years old, admitted to Intensive Care Units after joint replacement surgery, with informed consent. A computer-generated randomization sequence (in a 1:1 ratio) was used to randomly assign patients to receive either dexmedetomidine (0.1 Î¼g/kg per hour, from intensive care unit admission on the day of surgery) or placebos once daily for up to 3 days. Participants, care providers, and investigators were all masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was incidence of delirium, assessed twice daily with the Confusion Assessment Method during the first 7 postoperative days. Analyses were performed by intention-to-treat and safety populations. Results: Between August 1, 2015, and August 1, 2017, 545 patients were assessed. A total of 453 were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (n=226) or dexmedetomidine (n=227). Incidence of postoperative delirium was significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group (30 {$[$}13.2{\%}{$]$} of 227 patients) than the placebo group (64 {$[$}28.3{\%}{$]$} of 226 patients (Odds ratio {$[$}OR{$]$}=0.385, 95{\%} CI 0.238-0.624; p<0.0001). Regarding safety, incidence of hypertension was higher with placebos (32 {$[$}14.2{\%}{$]$} of 226 patients) than with dexmedetomidine (18 {$[$}7.9{\%}{$]$} of 227 patients; OR=0.522, 95{\%} CI 0.284-0.961; p=0.034). Occurrence of hypotension and bradycardia did not differ between groups. Conclusion: The current study suggests that acute dexmedetomidine treatment can reduce incidence of delirium after joint replacement. However, no evidence was found that dexmedetomidine can improve clinical outcomes. The therapy was safe. Further investigation is necessary to fully understand the potential usefulness of dexmedetomidine in older patients.},

	abstract = {Background: The aim of this clinical study was to evaluate the efficacy of neurobehavioral, hemodynamics and sedative characteristics of dexmedetomidine compared with morphine and midazolam-based regimen after cardiac surgery at equivalent levels of sedation and analgesia in improving clinically relevant outcomes such as delirium. Methods: Sixty patients were randomly allocated into one of two equal groups: group A = 30 patients received dexmedetomidine infusion (0.4-0.7 Î¼g/kg/h) and Group B = 30 patients received morphine in a dose of 10-50 Î¼g/kg/h as an analgesic with midazolam in a dose of 0.05 mg/kg up to 0.2 mg/kg as a sedative repeated as needed. Titration of the study medication infusions was conducted to maintain light sedation (Richmond agitation-sedation scale) (-2 to +1). Primary outcome was the prevalence of delirium measured daily through confusion assessment method for intensive care. Results: Group A was associated with shorter length of mechanical ventilation, significant shorter duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay (P = 0.038), and lower risk of delirium following cardiac surgery compared to Group B. Group A showed statistically significant decrease in heart rate values 4 h after ICU admission (P = 0.015) without significant bradycardia. Group A had lower fentanyl consumption following cardiac surgery compared to Group B. Conclusion: Dexmedetomidine significantly reduced the length of stay in ICU in adult cardiac surgery with no significant reduction in the incidence of postoperative delirium compared to morphine and midazolam.},

	abstract = {Objective: To study the preventive effect of dexmedetomidine (DEX) on the postoperative delirium (POD) in elderly patients aged over 75 years old after vertebral fracture operation, and its regulating effect on the depth of anesthesia during operation. Methods: A total of 90 patients aged 75-90 years old with vertebral fractures surgically treated under general anesthesia in Nanxiang Hospital of Shanghai Jiading District from January 2015 to December 2017 were enrolled in this study. They were randomly divided into the DEX group (group A, n=30), the midazolam group (group B, n=30) and the control group (group C, n=30). Group A was injected with DEX (0.5 Î¼g/kg) through a pump for 10 min before anesthesia induction, and then the drug was maintained at 0.4 Î¼g/(kgÂ·h) until the end of operation; group B received intravenous injection of 0.03 mg/kg midazolam; group C was given the same dose of normal saline. During operation, the bispectral index (BIS) was used to monitor the depth of anesthesia, which was maintained by adjusting the inspired concentration of sevoflurane (BIS value: 55-60). The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, extubation time, Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale at extubation, intraoperative sevoflurane dosage, statuses of postoperative nausea, vomiting, dizziness and other adverse reactions, and delirium assessment at 1-5 days after operation (confusion assessment method) were recorded and compared. Results: There were no significant differences in general condition, operation time, intraoperative blood loss and fracture site among the three groups of patients (all P>0.05). Extubation time in group B was longer than those in group A and C (P<0.05), and there was no significant difference in extubation time between group A and C (P>0.05). The agitation rates at extubation of patients in group B and C were significantly higher than that in group A (P<0.05). The intraoperative dosage of sevoflurane in group A was obviously less than those in group B and C (P<0.05). There were no significant differences in the incidence rate of postoperative adverse reactions among the three groups of patients (P>0.05). The incidence rate of POD in group A was apparently lower than those in group B and C (P<0.05); the incidence rate of POD at 1-2 days after operation in group B was higher than that in group C (P<0.05); there was no significant difference in the incidence rate of POD at 3-5 days after operation between group B and C (P>0.05). Conclusion: DEX not only had a good sedative effect, but also could be used in combination with sevoflurane to control the depth of anesthesia, reduce the dosage of sevoflurane, and lower the incidence rate of POD in elderly patients after vertebral fracture operation and the agitation rate at extubation under general anesthesia.},

	abstract = {Background: Studies have shown that perioperative inflammatory response is one of the important factors that caused postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Ulinastatin is a broad-spectrum protease inhibitor that inhibits inflammatory. We investigated the effects of ulinastatin on inflammatory response and early postoperative cognitive function in elderly patients undergoing spinal surgery. Methods: This clinical trial was approved by the Xuanwu Hospital Ethical Committee (Registration number: ChiCTR-IPR-16008931). Sixty elderly patients undergoing elective spinal surgery with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) status of I-II were randomized into ulinastatin and control groups; total intravenous anesthesia was performed. The elderly patients in ulinastatin group underwent intravenous infusion of ulinastatin 10,000 units/kg following anesthesia induction and before surgical incision, and 5000 units/kg on post-operative days 1 and 2. Cognitive function was determined with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) test preoperatively and on post-operative day 7 by a neurologist. Serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) concentration levels were measured at baseline, the end of surgery, and on post-operative days 1 and 3. Results: All elderly patients completed the study. Ulinastatin infusion significantly reduced the incidence of POCD in elderly patients undergoing spine surgery (ulinastatin group 16{\%} vs. control group 43{\%}, Î§2 = 5.079, P = 0.024, P < 0.05). The elderly patients in ulinastatin group exhibited lower serum LPS, IL-6, CRP, and MMP-9 concentrations, as well as a shortened peak value duration, compared with those in the control group following surgery (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Systemic inflammation and translocation of LPS were inhibited by the infusion of ulinastatin in elderly patients undergoing spinal surgery. The anti-inflammation intervention with ulinastatin can significantly improve the elderly patients' postoperative cognitive function.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Delirium is known as an acute mental disturbance characterised by confused thinking and disrupted attention that is usually accompanied by disordered speech and hallucination. Delirium often is seen in patients post-surgery. Use of Melatonin pre-operatively decreases the incidence of post-operative delirium. Ramelteon is an agonist of melatonin having longer half-life than melatonin. Aim: To evaluate the efficacy of Ramelteon for the prevention of post-operative delirium in elderly patients. Materials and Methods: In this randomised controlled double-blind (all places) study, 50 patients with ASA I and II were selected and randomly assigned to each group. Group I received one tablet of Ramelteon (8 mg) 12 hours before surgery and 1 tablet of Ramelteon (8 mg) 1 hour before surgery and Group II received placebo one tablet 12 hours before surgery and 1 tablet 1 hour before surgery. Incidence of delirium was assessed by Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) at 1st, 2nd and 3rd day. The SPSS Version 21.0 was used for the statistical analyses and p-value <0.05 was considered as significant. The Chi-square test was used to compare the categorical variables between the groups. Unpaired t-test was used to compare the continuous variables between the groups. Results: Only two patients developed delirium in Ramelteon group, one patient at Day 2 and one patient at Day 3; but in control group, six patients develop delirium, three patients at day two and three patients at Day 3. The incidence of delirium in Ramelteon group was lower in comparison with placebo group but it was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Thus, it was observed that Ramelteon administration in pre-operative period decreases (non-significantly) the incidence of post-operative delirium with higher sedation scores. So Ramelteon can be recommended in the patients having high risk of developing post-operative delirium.},

@article{13483,
	abstract = {Growing evidence has shown that the elderly population is more susceptible to postoperative cognitive dysfunction/decline (POCD). It has been proven that dexmedetomidine can reduce postoperative cognitive function impairment in elderly patients. Whether dexmedetomidine is better than midazolam in reducing incidence of POCD in elderly surgical patients, however, remains unknown. A total of 198 surgery patients (non-cardiac and non-neurosurgery) were enrolled in the current study. A total of 98 patients (DEX group) received a dose of 0.5 ug/kg dexmedetomidine before the induction of general anesthesia. Another 100 patients (MZ group) received midazolam 0.05 mg/kg. Serum samples of S100Î²protein levels were determined immediately before the application of dexmedetomidine or midazolam and 1 hour after surgery. The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) was evaluated at the day before surgery, 5-7 days postoperative, and 3 months postoperative. Results showed that, at 5-7 days after surgery, 52 (26{\%}) patients experienced POCD, with 24 (24.5{\%}) in the DEX group and 28 (28.0{\%}) in the MZ group (24 VS 28, P = 0.575). Three months after surgery, 132 patients accepted the MMSE test, with 16 (12.1{\%}) of them experiencing POCD, including 9 (12.9{\%}) in the DEX group and 7 (11.7{\%}) in the MZ group (9 VS 7, P = 0.783). Increased levels of S100Î²protein were higher in the MZ group than DEX group (100.68 $\pm$94.37 pg/mL VS 51.33 $\pm$88.78 pg/mL, P < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that postoperative pneumonia (incidence of postoperative pneumonia in POCD group VS non-POCD group was 0.12 $\pm$0.32 VS 0.08 $\pm$0.28 respectively, P = 0.041), lower preoperative MMSE scores (22.83 $\pm$3.49 VS 25.55 $\pm$3.27, P < 0.001), and increased levels of S100Î²(134.80 $\pm$81.63 VS 55.40 $\pm$90.41, P < 0.001) were risk factors of POCD occurring within 5-7 days after surgery. Age was included in the risk factors of POCD occurring within 3 months postoperative (71.56 $\pm$4.35 VS 69.22 $\pm$4.29, P = 0.031), except for lower preoperative MMSE scores (24.75 $\pm$3.53 VS 25.94 $\pm$2.96, p = 0.001) and increased levels of S100Î²(92.08 $\pm$74.12 VS 69.70 $\pm$95.84, P = 0.002). Present results indicate that dexmedetomidine can reduce neuronal injuries but can't reduce incidence of POCD in the elderly, compared with midazolam. Risk factors for POCD occurring at different postoperative periods are different. Age is a potential risk factor of long-term POCD, but not for early POCD in the elderly.},

@article{13406,
	abstract = {Background: Recent studies have shown that early diagnosis and intervention promote the patient's good prognosis. For patients who underwent cardiac surgery and require extracorporeal circulation support, the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is higher than in other types of surgery due to greater changes in brain perfusion compared with normal physiological conditions. Recent studies have confirmed that the use of ulinastatin or dexmedetomidine in the perioperative period effectively reduces the incidence of POCD. In this study, ulinastatin was combined with dexmedetomidine to assess whether the combination of the two drugs could reduce the incidence of POCD. Methods: One hundred and eighty patients with heart valve replacement surgery undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass from August 2017 to December 2018 were enrolled, with age 60--80 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grades I--III, education level above elementary school, and either gender. According to the random number table method, patients were grouped into ulinastatin + dexmedetomidine (U+D) group, ulinastatin (U) group, dexmedetomidine (D) group, and normal saline (N) control group. Group U was pumped 20,000 UI/kg immediately after induction and the first day after surgery, group D continued to pump 0.4 Î¼g/kg/h from induction to 2 h before extubation, group U+D dexmedetomidine 0.4 Î¼g/kg/h + ulinastatin 20,000 UI/kg, and group N equal volume of physiological saline. The patients were enrolled with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) before surgery. The cognitive function was assessed by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) on the first day before surgery and on the seventh day after surgery. Inflammatory factors, such as S100Î²protein, interleukin (IL)-6, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±, were detected in peripheral blood before anesthesia (T0), immediately after surgery (T1), and immediately after extubation (T2). Results: One hundred and fifty-four patients enrolled in this study. Compared with group N, the incidence of POCD in group U+D was the lowest (P < 0.05), followed by group U and group D. Group U+D had the lowest concentration of inflammatory factors at the T1 and T2 time points, followed by group U and group D. Conclusions: Both ulinastatin and dexmedetomidine can reduce the perioperative inflammatory response and the incidence of POCD in patients with heart valve surgery, and their combination can better reduce the incidence of POCD.},

Those anesthetized by dexmedetomidine were regarded as the routine group (RG, 83 cases), and those anesthetized by ulinastatin and dexmedetomidine were considered as the combined group (CG, 95 cases). The operation conditions of the two groups, the pain scores (VAS) at 4 h, 24 h and 48 h after surgery, and the MMSE scores before, 1 d and 3 d after surgery were recorded. The incidence of cognitive dysfunction and adverse reactions were compared between both groups. The serum S-100Î²protein (S-100Î²) and inflammatory factors were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The risk factors of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) were analyzed. The eye-opening time of clinical indexes in the CG was dramatically lower than in the RG, while other indexes had no marked difference. The VAS scores of the CG were lower than those of the RG at 4 h, 24 h and 48 h after operation. The MMSE scores of patients in the CG were dramatically higher than those in the RG at 1 d and 3 d after surgery. The total incidence of POCD in the CG was lower than that in the RG. There was no remarkable difference in the total incidence of adverse reactions between both groups. The S-100Î²expression level in the CG was dramatically lower than in the RG at 1 d and 3 d after surgery. The improvement level of inflammatory factors in the CG was dramatically better than that in the RG. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis identified that the eye-opening time, VAS score, IL-10, TNFÎ±, CRP, and S-100Î²were independent risk factors for POCD occurrence in elderly CC patients after surgery. Ulinastatin combined with dexmedetomidine anesthesia induction can improve the prognosis of elderly CC patients after laparoscopic and it also reduces postoperative pain and serum inflammatory factors. S-100Î²concentration can improve the POCD occurrence after surgery.},

	abstract = {Effect of dexmedetomidine on the cognitive function of patients undergoing gastric cancer surgery by regulating the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway was investigated. A total of 110 patients who were diagnosed and underwent radical gastrectomy in Ruijin Hospital North, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine from July 2016 to July 2018 were selected. In the experimental group, 60 patients were treated with dexmedetomidine infusion. In the control group, 50 patients were injected with 0.9{\%} sodium chloride injection during the same period. The expression levels of serum inflammatory factors tumor necrosis factor-Î±(TNF-Î±), interleukin-6 (IL-6), PI3K and AKT of patients were compared between the two groups before and after surgery for 1 day. The number of adverse reactions in the two groups was compared. The correlation between mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score and the expression levels of serum IL-6, PI3K and AKT was compared. The levels of serum TNF-Î±, IL-6, PI3K and AKT after operation for 1 day of patients in the two groups were significantly higher than those before operation (P<0.05), and were lower in the experimental than in the control group (P<0.05). The number of postoperative cognitive dysfunction of patients in the experimental group was lower than that of patients in the control group (P<0.05). The total number of adverse reactions in the control group was higher than that of patients in the experimental group (P<0.05). The MMSE scores of the two groups were decreased at 1 day after operation and were significantly lower in the control group than in the experimental group (P<0.05). The MMSE score was negatively correlated with the expression levels of serum TNF-Î±, IL-6, PI3K and AKT (P<0.001). Dexmedetomidine can effectively reduce the expression levels of postoperative inflammatory factors in patients undergoing gastric cancer surgery, improve the postoperative cognitive function by regulating PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and promotes the recovery of postoperative cognitive function.},

	abstract = {Effect of dexmedetomidine on the brain function and hemodynamics in patients undergoing lung cancer resection were explored. Eighty-seven patients with lung cancer undergoing lung cancer resection in Weifang People's Hospital from January 2014 to June 2018 were enrolled in this study. Patients conventionally anesthetized by propofol, midazolam, sufentanil, or cisatracurium besilate (41 cases) were assigned to the control group and those anesthetized by conventional anesthetic and dexmedetomidine (46 cases) were assigned to the research group. The hemodynamic parameters, neuronâspecific enolase (NSE), and astrocyte S-100p protein (S-100Î²) were compared between the two groups before induction (T0), 5 min after induction (T1), at the end of surgery (T2), time of extubation (T3), and 5 min after extubation (T4). The cognitive function of patients was graded by the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) after patients recovered from anesthesia. In both the control group and the research group, the levels of mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and central venous pressure (CVP). were statistically higher at T2 and T3 than those at T0 (all P<0.05). The levels of MAP, HR, and CVP were statistically lower in the research group than those in the control group at T2 and T3 (P<0.05). The levels of serum NSE and S100Î²protein in the research group and the control group increased at T2, T3, and T4, the control group was higher than the research group at each time point, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Comparison of the MMSE score and the total case number of adverse reactions between the two groups showed no statistical difference (both P>0.05). The MMSE score was positively correlated with the serum levels of NSE and S100Î²in the two groups (r-values were 0.661 and 0.585, P<0.05). Dexmedetomidine can effectively protect patients' perioperative brain function with small impacts on perioperative hemodynamics, so it is worthy of clinical application.},

	abstract = {Objective: To analyze the influence of anesthetic induction of propofol combined with esketamine on perioperative stress and inflammatory responses and postoperative cognition in elderly surgical patients. Methods: A total of 80 elderly surgical patients were randomly divided into a control group (n=40) and a study group (n=40). The control group received anesthetic induction with propofol combined with sufentanil, while the study group received anesthetic induction with propofol combined with esketamine. Hemodynamics, stress and inflammatory responses and changes in cognitive function, perioperative related indexes and adverse responses were compared between the two groups. Results: At T1, the levels of adrenaline, norepinephrine, endothelin, C-reactive protein, white blood cell and procalcitonin in the two groups were not markedly changed compared with those at T0. The levels of the indices at T2and T3were elevated compared with those at T1. However, the levels of the indices at T4were almost close to those at T0, and the levels in the study group were higher than those in the control group. There were statistically significant differences in the comparison of the interaction of the levels of the aforementioned indices between groups, between time points, and between groups and time points (P < 0.05). At 24 h after surgery, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores were decreased in both groups, and the MoCA scores in the study group were higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05). The anesthesia time and consciousness recovery time in the study group were shorter than those in the control group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The anesthetic induction of propofol combined with esketamine, exhibits a good safety profile and reliability, it can improve hemodynamics and surgical stress and inflammatory responses, shorten anesthesia time, promote the recovery of postoperative cognitive function, and cause relatively mild adverse responses.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Postoperative delirium is a common complication of cardiac surgery. This study aimed to assess the effect of supplementing dexmedetomidine infusion with oral melatonin in prevention of postoperative delirium after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Methods: 110 patients of both sexes above 60 years of age were included. Anesthetic management was standardized. Patients were randomly allocated into one of the two study groups, dexmedetomidine/melatonin (DM) group or dexmedetomidine (D) group. Patients in the DM group received oral Melatonin tablet 5 mg the night before surgery and same dose was repeated every 24 hours for 3 postoperative days. After completion of surgery and upon ICU arrival, patients in both groups received a bolus of 0.4 Âµg/kg dexmedetomidine followed by 0.2--0.7 Âµg/kg/h infusion, for 24 maximum hours. Delirium was assessed for 5 days postoperatively at 12 hr intervals using confusion assessment method (CAM) for ICU and after discharge from ICU to surgical ward using CAM. Delirious patients were treated with IV haloperidol. Results: No significant differences between studied groups regarding baseline, preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative characteristics. Incidence of delirium was significantly lower, onset significantly more delayed, and duration was significantly shorter in group-DM as compared to group-D. No significant differences between all cases, cases who had delirium, and cases who did not have delirium in the two groups as regards extubation time, ICU stay, and hospital stay. Conclusion: supplementing dexmedetomidine with melatonin decreases incidence, delays onset, and shortens duration of postoperative delirium in patients above 60 years of age undergoing CABG surgery.},

	abstract = {Background: To evaluate the effects of dexmedetomidine on the incidence of postoperative delirium (POD) and plasma S-100Î²protein levels in elderly patients undergoing hip surgery. Methods: A total of 110 elderly patients who underwent hip surgery were enrolled in this study and grouped using the random number table method. The study group (55 patients) received 0.5 Î¼g/kg dexmedetomidine before anesthesia induction and the control group (55 patients) received an equal dose of 0.9{\%} sodium chloride injection before anesthesia induction. Results: Compared with the control group, the study group had lower fentanyl and propofol consumption, shorter time to waking up, shorter time to respiratory recovery, shorter extubation time, and lower incidence of POD (p < 0.05).Mean arterial pressure, oxygen saturation, and heart rate at T1 and T2 were lower than those at T0 in the control group as well as lower than those in the study group at the same time point (p < 0.05). Both groups showed higher S-100Î²levels at T1, T2, and T3 compared with those at T0 (p < 0.05); however, the levels were lower in the study group than in the control group at the abovementioned time points (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Dexmedetomidine could decrease the consumption of anesthetic drugs, shorten postoperative recovery time, stabilize hemodynamics, decrease adverse reactions caused by anesthesia, and decrease the incidence of POD, which may be achieved by improving cerebral metabolism, regulating serum S-100Î²levels.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of dexmedetomidine-assisted intravenous inhalation combined anesthesia on cerebral oxygen metabolism and serum Th1/Th2 levels in elderly patients with colorectal cancer. METHOD: From April 2018 to May 2020,100 elderly patients undergoing elective laparoscopic radical resection of colorectal cancer were prospectively selected and randomly divided into observation group and control group. Before induction of anesthesia, the loading dose of dexmedetomidine was given at 0.5 mug/kg, and the infusion time was 15 min. After tracheal intubation, 0.4 mug/kg/h dexmedetomidine was continuously pumped, and the infusion was stopped 40 min before the end of the operation. In the control group, the same amount of 0.9{\%} sodium chloride was injected intravenously in the same way. 30 min before induction of anesthesia (T0), immediately before induction of anesthesia (T1), immediately after tracheal intubation (T2), 40 min before operation (T3), and immediately after operation (T4), record the blood oxygen content of the artery and internal jugular vein Difference (D(a-jv)O2), brain oxygen uptake rate (COER{\%}), brain oxygen saturation (rSO2) mean. VAS scale, Ramsay scale, MoCA scale were taken at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h postoperatively to evaluate analgesia, sedation, and cognitive function. And monitor the levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin-4 (IL-4), myelin basic protein (MBP), neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and S100beta. The occurrence of restlessness and adverse reactions during the recovery period of the two groups were compared. RESULT: The levels of D(a-jv)O2, COER{\%}, and rSO2 in the control group and observation group were higher than the preoperative basic values at T2, T3, and T4 (P < 0.05); The levels of D(a-jv)O2, COER{\%}, and rSO2 in the observation group were lower than those in the control group at T2, T3, and T4 (P < 0.05). The VAS score and Ramsay score of the observation group were lower than those of the control group at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after surgery, while the MoCA score was higher than that of the control group (P < 0.05). In addition, the serum IFN-gamma, MBP, NSE and S100beta levels of the observation group were lower than those of the control group (P < 0.05), and the ratio of IFN-gamma/IL-4 was higher than that of the control group (P < 0.05). The overall incidence of adverse reactions in the observation group was lower than that in the control group {$[$}32.0{\%} (16/50) vs. 12.0{\%} (6/50), P < 0.05{$]$}. CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine-assisted combined intravenous and inhalation anesthesia is beneficial to reduce perioperative cerebral oxygen metabolism and improve postoperative immunosuppression in elderly patients with colorectal cancer. It has a certain protective effect on nerve injury after operation, thus improving the cognitive function of patients and reducing the occurrence of adverse reactions.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of dexmedetomidine combined with epidural anesthesia on cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in elderly patients after orthopedic surgery. METHODS: A total of 187 elderly patients who needed orthopedic surgery in our hospital from January 2019 to December 2020 were randomly divided into an experimental group (n=95) and a control group (n=92). The patients in the experimental group were administered 1 mug/kg dexmedetomidine hydrochloride injections, and the patients in the control group were administered 0.9{\%} sodium chloride injections, which were infused using a micropump for about 10 minutes. The two groups' cognitive function, VAS scores, and vital signs were compared. RESULTS: There were significant differences in the two groups' mean arterial pressures and heart rates at intubation time (T3), operation start time (T4), and extubation time (T6) (P < 0.05). The VAS scores in the experimental group were significantly different from the VAS scores in the control group at 24 hours after the operations, 48 hours after the operations, 72 hours after the operations, and 7 days after the operations (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in the anesthesia times, the average bleeding volumes, or the average operative durations (P > 0.05). 48 hours after the operations, the MMSE score in the experimental group was (27.15+/-1.17), which was significantly different than the MMSE score in the control group (23.11+/-0.83), and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Epidural anesthesia combined with dexmedetomidine has little circulatory interference in elderly patients; moreover, it can reduce the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Experimental evidence has indicated the benefits of melatonin (Mel) for the treatment of delirium. Clinical trials had no definite conclusions concerning Mel on delirium after percutaneous transluminal coronary intervention (PCI) in elderly patients. The present study explored whether acute Mel treatment could reduce the incidence of delirium. METHODS: This trial enrolled patients over the age of 60, who were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) after PCI. A computer-generated randomization sequence (in a 1:1 ratio) was used to randomly assign patients to receive Mel (3 mg/day) or placebo once daily for up to 7 days. The primary endpoint was the incidence of delirium, assessed twice daily with the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) during the first 7 postoperative days. Analyses were performed using intention-to-treat and safety populations. RESULTS: A total of 297 patients randomly were assigned to receive either placebo (N = 149) or Mel (N = 148). The incidence of postoperative delirium was significantly lower in the Mel group than in the placebo group (27.0{\%} vs. 39.6{\%}, respectively, P = 0.02). There was no significant difference between 30-day all-cause mortality (12.2{\%} vs. 14.1{\%}, P = 0.62) and drug reactions (0 vs. 2.0{\%}, P = 0.25). The length of stay and hospitalization costs in the Mel group were significantly decreased compared with those in the placebo group (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The current study suggests that Mel is safe and effective in the treatment of delirium after PCI. Further investigation is necessary to fully understand the potential usefulness of Mel in older patients via larger randomized, multicenter, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trials.},

@article{9616,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ketamine is typically used by anesthesiologists as an adjunct for general anesthesia and as a nonopioid analgesic. It has been explored for prevention of postoperative delirium, although results have been contradictory. In this study, we investigated the association of ketamine with postoperative delirium and specific encephalographic signatures. Furthermore, we examined these associations in the context of baseline neurocognition as measured by a validated assessment. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study from January 2019 to December 2020. Ninety-eight patients aged >/=65 years and undergoing spine surgery scheduled for >/=3 hours were included in the study. All participants who completed the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Brain Health Assessment preoperatively and postoperatively were assessed with the confusion assessment method for intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) and/or the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (NuDESC). Patients had frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings (SedLine Root, Masimo, Corp) quantitatively analyzed. We used 60 seconds of artifact-free EEG (without burst suppression) extracted from the middle of the maintenance period to calculate the normalized power spectral density (PSD). Comparisons were made between those who did or did not receive ketamine and according to results from neurocognitive assessments. RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients (of a total of 155, enrolled and consented) had EEG of sufficient quality for analysis (42 women). Overall, we found a significant increase in the EEG power in the moderate frequency range (10-20 Hz) in patients that received ketamine. When the patients were divided by their preoperative cognitive status, this result in the ketamine group only held true for the cognitively normal patients. Patients that were cognitively impaired at baseline did not demonstrate a significant change in EEG characteristics based on ketamine administration, but impaired patients that received ketamine had a significantly higher rate of postoperative delirium (52{\%} ketamine versus 20{\%} no ketamine) (odds ratio {$[$}OR{$]$}, 4.36; confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$}, 1.02-18.22; P = .048). In patients determined to be preoperatively cognitively normal, the incidence of postoperative delirium was not significantly associated with ketamine administration (19{\%} ketamine versus 17{\%} no ketamine) (OR, 1.10; CI, 0.30-4.04; P = .5833). CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine-related changes in EEG are observed in a heterogeneous group of patients receiving spine surgery. This result was driven primarily by the effect of ketamine on cognitively normal patients and not observed in patients that were cognitively impaired at baseline. Furthermore, patients who were cognitively impaired at baseline and who had received ketamine were more likely to develop postoperative delirium, suggesting that cognitive vulnerability might be predicted by the lack of a neurophysiologic response to ketamine.},

@article{9256,
	abstract = {Background: Patients undergoing cardiac surgery are particularly prone to delirium. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of melatonin administration on the inhibition of postoperative delirium in patients undergoing open-heart surgery. Methods: This study was conducted as a double-blind randomized clinical trial in Golestan Hospital. Ahvaz, Iran, (September 2018 to March 2019). Sixty patients undergoing elective on-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery were enrolled in the study, and they were randomly divided into a group receiving 3 mg of melatonin and a group receiving a placebo. The main outcomes were delirium occurrence and delirium intensity up to 48 hours after extubation. The data were analyzed using SPSS, version 22, (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Group comparisons were performed using the t test and the Chi-square test. Statistical significance was defined as a P value of less than 0.05. Results: On the first postoperative day, delirium developed in four (13.3{\%}) patients in the melatonin group and 11 (36.6{\%}) patients in the control group; the difference between the groups was statistically significant (P=0.037). On the second postoperative day, delirium developed in three (10{\%}) patients in the melatonin group and 14 (46.6{\%}) patients in the control group, with the difference in the incidence of delirium between the groups constituting statistical significance (P=0.029). The severity of delirium between group was significant on the first and second postoperative days (P=0.003). Conclusion: Melatonin may be effective in reducing the severity of delirium after cardiac surgery. The effect of melatonin as a delirium prevention agent should be considered in patients admitted in the cardiovascular intensive care. Trial Registration Number IRCT20180909040979N3.},

@article{8558,
	abstract = {Importance: Postoperative ileus is common after abdominal surgery, and small clinical studies have reported that intraoperative administration of dexmedetomidine may be associated with improvements in postoperative gastrointestinal function. However, findings have been inconsistent and study samples have been small. Further examination of the effects of intraoperative dexmedetomidine on postoperative gastrointestinal function is needed. Objective: To evaluate the effects of intraoperative intravenous dexmedetomidine vs placebo on postoperative gastrointestinal function among older patients undergoing abdominal surgery. Design, Setting, and Participants: This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial was conducted at the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University in Hefei, China (lead site), and 12 other tertiary hospitals in Anhui Province, China. A total of 808 participants aged 60 years or older who were scheduled to receive abdominal surgery with an expected surgical duration of 1 to 6 hours were enrolled. The study was conducted from August 21, 2018, to December 9, 2019. Interventions: Dexmedetomidine infusion (a loading dose of 0.5 mug/kg over 15 minutes followed by a maintenance dose of 0.2 mug/kg per hour) or placebo infusion (normal saline) during surgery. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was time to first flatus. Secondary outcomes were postoperative gastrointestinal function measured by the I-FEED (intake, feeling nauseated, emesis, physical examination, and duration of symptoms) scoring system, time to first feces, time to first oral feeding, incidence of delirium, pain scores, sleep quality, postoperative nausea and vomiting, hospital costs, and hospital length of stay. Results: Among 808 patients enrolled, 404 were randomized to receive intraoperative dexmedetomidine, and 404 were randomized to receive placebo. In total, 133 patients (60 in the dexmedetomidine group and 73 in the placebo group) were excluded because of protocol deviations, and 675 patients (344 in the dexmedetomidine group and 331 in the placebo group; mean {$[$}SD{$]$} age, 70.2 {$[$}6.1{$]$} years; 445 men {$[$}65.9{\%}{$]$}) were included in the per-protocol analysis. The dexmedetomidine group had a significantly shorter time to first flatus (median, 65 hours {$[$}IQR, 48-78 hours{$]$} vs 78 hours {$[$}62-93 hours{$]$}, respectively; P < .001), time to first feces (median, 85 hours {$[$}IQR, 68-115 hours{$]$} vs 98 hours {$[$}IQR, 74-121 hours{$]$}; P = .001), and hospital length of stay (median, 13 days {$[$}IQR, 10-17 days{$]$} vs 15 days {$[$}IQR, 11-18 days{$]$}; P = .005) than the control group. Postoperative gastrointestinal function (as measured by the I-FEED score) and delirium incidence were similar in the dexmedetomidine and control groups (eg, 248 patients {$[$}72.1{\%}{$]$} vs 254 patients {$[$}76.7{\%}{$]$}, respectively, had I-FEED scores indicating normal postoperative gastrointestinal function; 18 patients {$[$}5.2{\%}{$]$} vs 12 patients {$[$}3.6{\%}{$]$} had delirium on postoperative day 3). Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, the administration of intraoperative dexmedetomidine reduced the time to first flatus, time to first feces, and length of stay after abdominal surgery. These results suggest that this therapy may be a viable strategy to enhance postoperative recovery of gastrointestinal function among older adults.

@article{7240,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study examined recovery, delirium, and neurocognitive outcome in elderly patients receiving dexmedetomidine or propofol sedation after undergoing cardiac surgery. DESIGN: Open-label randomized trial. SETTING: Single center. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 70 patients older than 75 years without English language limitations and Mini Mental State Examination scores >20. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received either propofol (group P) or dexmedetomidine (group D) postoperatively until normothermic and hemodynamically stable. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Quality of recovery (QoR) was measured by the QoR-40 questionnaire on postoperative day (POD) three. Secondary outcomes were incidence and duration of delirium, time to extubation, length of hospital stay, hospital mortality rate, postoperative quality of life (QoL; measured by SF-36 performed at baseline and six months postoperatively), and neurocognitive disorder (measured by Minnesota Cognitive Acuity Screen {$[$}MCAS{$]$} performed at baseline, POD5, and six months postoperatively). A total of sixty-seven patients completed the trial. There was no significant difference in QoR-40 scores (95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$}, -7.6081-to-10.9781; p=1.000), incidence of delirium (group P, 42{\%}; group D, 24{\%}; p=0.191), mean hospital stay (95{\%} CI, -5.4838-to-1.5444; p=0.297), mean time to extubation (95{\%} CI, -19.2513-to-7.5561; p=0.866), or mean duration of delirium (95{\%} CI, -4.3065-to-1.067; p=0.206) between groups. No patients died in the hospital. There were no significant differences in changes in SF-36 or MCAS scores over time between groups. There was a decline in MCAS score from preoperatively to POD5 in group P (95{\%} CI, -8.95725-to- -2.61775; p=0.0005), which was greater than that observed in group D. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' findings demonstrated that the use of dexmedetomidine compared with propofol in elderly patients undergoing cardiac surgery was unlikely to improve QoR/postoperative QoL. Although the study was underpowered to detect secondary outcomes, the results suggested no reductions in delirium, time to extubation, and hospital stay, but a potential decrease in delayed neurocognitive recovery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A clinical study indicated that infusion of dexmedetomidine without a loading dose administered intraoperatively provided a smooth and hemodynamically stable emergence and improved the quality of recovery with fewer postoperative side effects and reduced analgesic requirements. The objective was to determine whether administering remifentanil-propofol combined with dexmedetomidine during general anesthesia would decrease the incidence and severity of postoperative emergence agitation, anxiety, and depression without affecting cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients. METHODS: A total of 120 elderly patients scheduled for ureteroscopic holmium laser lithotripsy were randomly allocated to the PR group and administered normal saline, and the PRD group was administered dexmedetomidine 0.4 mug kg(-1) h(-1) intravenously after the induction of anesthesia and stopped 30 min before the end of surgery. The primary outcome was the Mini-Mental State Examination score. The secondary outcomes were the Richmond Agitation Sedation, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale scores; the memory span for Arabic numerals; the duration of surgery; and the time to spontaneous respiration, recovery, and extubation. RESULTS: The MMSE scores were lower at T1-2 in the two groups (P < 0.001). The dosage of propofol and remifentanil decreased more significantly in the PRD group than in the PR group (P < 0.001). Both the RASS scores and the incidence of emergence agitation (EA) in the PRD group were significantly lower than those in the PR group at t1-3 (P < 0.001). Compared to the PR group, the ZSDS scores and STAI scores at T1-2 were lower in the PRD group (P < 0.005). The number of the Arabic numbers that were accurately recalled from memory was lower at T2 in the PR group than in the PRD group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine administration has no influence on postoperative cognitive dysfunction but could reduce both the dosage of remifentanil and propofol needed during ureteroscopic holmium laser lithotripsy and the incidence and severity of postoperative emergence agitation, anxiety, and depression in elderly patients.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of dexmedetomidine intervention on serum inflammatory factor concentration and postoperative cognitive malfunction in elderly patients with general anesthesia. Methodology. 174 patients with general anesthesia were selected, who were categorized into a control group (HC) and a dexmedetomidine group (HS) using the random number table method, with 87 patients in individual groups. The dexmedetomidine group was pumped intravenously with dexmedetomidine at a loading dose of 1 Î¼g/kg before induction of anesthesia for 15 min, followed by continuous intravenous pumping at a rate of 0.4 Î¼g/kg/h, and the dosing was stopped at 30 min before concluding the surgery. The control group was administered the identical dose of saline in the same manner. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor Î±(TNF-Î±) levels and MMES scores were tested at 1 h before and 24 h after anesthesia. RESULTS: Comparing to HC group, patients in the HS group had lower TNF-Î±and IL-6 levels at both scheduled points (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine reduced the expression of inflammatory factors in elderly patients with general anesthesia and effectively reduced the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction after general anesthesia surgery.},

	abstract = {This study analyzed the preventive effects of low-dose dexmedetomidine on postoperative cognitive function and recovery quality in elderly oral cancer patients by observing the perioperative kinetics of inflammatory cytokines, cortisol and melatonin.A total of 149 elderly oral cancer patients who had undergone tumor resection surgery were selected and randomly divided into 2 groups, Group D and Group S. After surgery, Group D was assigned to take intravenous dexmedetomidine at a dose of 0.2 Î¼g/kg/h for 12 h, while Group S was administered physiological saline in the same manner. On the day of surgery and for the first three postoperative days, the patients were assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and a 40-item quality of recovery score questionnaire (QoR40) at 7:00 am every morning. Venous blood was harvested at the same time. Then, IL-6, CRP, cortisol and melatonin levels were measured. There were no significant between-group differences in the baseline characteristics. After surgery, the MMSE and QoR40 scores in Group D were better than those in Group S. No between-group differences were observed in the incidences of severe hypotension and bradycardia. Moreover, respiratory depression was not observed in the 2 groups. The peaks of IL-6, CRP and cortisol concentrations in Group D were lower than those in Group S. However, the melatonin levels did not differ between the 2 groups. In elderly patients, intravenous dexmedetomidine administered postoperatively for 12 h at a dose of 0.2 ug/kg/h could improve postoperative cognitive function and recovery quality by decreasing excessive inflammation and stress levels.},

	abstract = {Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is performed with increasing frequency in aging populations. However, in elderly patients, cognitive dysfunction following surgery may impair the outcome of surgical procedures. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) has been demonstrated to have a neuroprotectve effect in animal experiments. However, it is unclear whether DEX also has a neuroprotective effect in human patients. The present study was a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind trial of 126 patients who had undergone laparoscopic cholecystectomy, using clinical interviews to determine whether intravenously administrated DEX during general anesthesia ameliorates cognitive function impairment. The cognitive deficit of each patient was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The scores on the MMSE for the DEX and control groups one week after surgery (DEX group, 27.6$\pm$1.2; control group, 25.7$\pm$1.5) were significantly different (P=0.005). The MMSE scores of patients â¤65 years old were significantly higher than those of patients >65 one week after surgery. The MMSE scores were significantly different between the two age groups in the control patients (â¤65 years old, 28.3$\pm$1.2; >65 years old, 26.6$\pm$2.1; P=0.036), while the difference was not statistically significant in the DEX-treated patients. Eight patients in the DEX group and 15 patients in the control group had mild cognitive impairment (26â¥MMSE score â¥21) although the difference was not statistically significant. The findings of the present study support the hypothesis that DEX administration may be an effective method for ameliorating postoperative cognitive impairment in elderly patients who have undergone laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Further research is required to confirm the findings of the present study.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To study the effect of dexmedetomidine (Dex) on the expression of Neuroglobin (Ngb) and postoperative cognitive function in elderly patients undergoing minimally invasive coronary artery bypass surgery. METHODS: Forty patients, who underwent elective minimally invasive off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting in our hospital from January 2018 to December 2019, were randomly divided into the Dex group (N = 20) and control group (N = 20). Venous blood samples were taken to determine the expression level of Ngb in both groups. Mini mental status examination (MMSE) was used to detect the cognitive function of patients. RESULTS: The expression level of Ngb in the Dex group was significantly higher than that in the control group at 6h after one-lung ventilation and postoperative 24h (P < .01). The MMSE score of the Dex group was significantly higher than the control group at postoperative 7 days and postoperative 30 days (P < .01). Although with no statistical significance, the MMSE score of the Dex group was higher than the control group at postoperative 90 days (P > .05). The incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in the Dex group was significantly lower than that in the control group at postoperative 7 days and postoperative 30 days (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Dex used in elderly patients undergoing minimally invasive coronary artery bypass graft surgery can effectively increase the expression level of Ngb and reduce the incidence of POCD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a poorly understood complication particularly observed in elderly patients, with long-term poor outcome. The randomised study was to compare the incidence of POCD in elderly with bispectral index (BIS)-guided intra-operative use of either dexmedetomidine or propofol with sevoflurane. METHODS: Eighty-seven patients, planned for non-cardiac surgery under general anaesthesia, were included between June 2017 and March 2018. After exclusion of 7 patients, remaining 80 patients were randomised into dexmedetomidine group and propofol group with 40 patients each. In both the groups, BIS-guided anaesthesia was provided. Cognitive function was assessed by an anaesthesiologist using a battery of neuropsychological tests at baseline pre-operatively, third and seventh day after surgery. The data were entered into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21. RESULTS: Propofol group had a non-significant lower incidence of POCD on third day and dexmedetomidine group showed decreased incidence of POCD on seventh day, accompanied by lower anaesthetic requirement (inhalational as well as intravenous) concomitant with delayed emergence with an acceptable BIS value. CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine appeared to be anaesthetic sparing as compared to propofol. BIS monitoring for titrating depth of anaesthesia and hence the anaesthetic exposure is an invaluable tool as compared to routine care anaesthesia for reducing POCD. The patients in both groups did not develop significant POCD until the seventh post-operative day.},

@article{5240,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dexmedetomidine promotes normal sleep architecture; the drug also improves analgesia. We therefore tested the hypothesis that supplementing intravenous analgesia with dexmedetomidine reduces delirium in older patients recovering from orthopedic surgery. METHODS: In this double-blinded randomized controlled trial, we enrolled 712 older (aged 65-90 years) patients scheduled for major orthopedic surgery. Postoperative analgesia was provided by patient-controlled intravenous sufentanil, supplemented by randomly assigned dexmedetomidine (1.25 Î¼g/mL) or placebo, for up to three days. The primary outcome was the incidence of delirium assessed twice daily with the Confusion Assessment Method. Among secondary outcomes, pain severity was assessed twice daily and sleep quality once daily, each with an 11-point scale where 0 = no pain/the best possible sleep and 10 = the worst pain/the worst possible sleep. RESULTS: The incidence of postoperative delirium was 7.3{\%} (26 of 354) with placebo and 4.8{\%} (17 of 356) with dexmedetomidine; relative risk 0.65, 95{\%} CI 0.36 to 1.18; P = 0.151. Dexmedetomidine reduced pain both at rest (median difference -1 to 0 points, P â¤0.001) and with movement (-1 points, P < 0.001) throughout the first 5 postoperative days; it also improved subjective sleep quality during the first 3 postoperative days: day one median difference -1 point (95{\%} CI -1 to 0), P = 0.007; day two 0 point (-1 to 0), P = 0.010; and day three 0 point (-1 to 0), P = 0.003. The incidence of adverse events was similar in each group. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementing sufentanil intravenous analgesia with low-dose dexmedetomidine did not significantly reduce delirium, but improved analgesia and sleep quality without provoking adverse events.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common complication in cardiac surgery especially in elderly population which can lead to a delay of weaning from ventilator and extubation. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)-induced inflammation is related to POD. Anti-inflammatory effect of anesthetic agent might attenuate POD. AIMS: The present study was primarily aimed to compare within-24-h POD between ketamine-based anesthesia and propofol-based anesthesia during CPB. The secondary objective was to identify risk factors associated with within-24-h POD. SETTING AND DESIGN: Our study was a randomized controlled trial in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB. Enrolling patients were aged >65 years, and able to comprehensive communication. Exclusion criteria were aortic surgery, cognitive disorders, cerebrovascular and carotid disease, and positive result of preoperative CAM-ICU. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to group Ketamine infusion of 1 mg/kg/h and group Propofol infusion of 1.5-6 mg/kg/h during CPB. POD was evaluated by validated Thai version CAM-ICU at 8-24 hour after ICU arrival. STATISTICS: Chi-square, Fisher exact and t-test tests, univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were utilized. Results: Total 82 patients entered this study and 64 patients remained after exclusion (Group Ketamine = 32 and Group Propofol = 32). Within-24-h POD were 31.25{\%} and 56.25{\%} (P = 0.04) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were 71.45 and 65.53 mmHg (P = 0.01) respectively in Ketamine and Propofol group. Postoperative leukocytosis was a significant risk to POD (adjusted OR 124.5). CONCLUSION: With limitations of the study, prevention of 24-h POD in general by ketamine was inconclusive. In comparison with propofol, ketamine leaded to less events of 24-h POD and kept higher MAP. Severity of postoperative inflammation was a significant prediction of 24-h POD.},

@article{5164,
	abstract = {CONTEXT: Little is known about the relationship between sedative drugs used preoperatively and postoperative delirium. Melatonin is a drug used to sedate patients preoperatively and is hypothesized by recent works to have a curative effect on postoperative delirium. AIMS: The incidence of postoperative delirium will be tested if affected by three different sedative drugs including melatonin. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Controlled randomized doubleblind study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three-hundred patients aged>65 years scheduled for hip arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia were randomly distributed to one of the four groups. Group 1 (control) received nothing for sedation. Group 2 (melatonin) received 5 mg melatonin. Group 3 (midazolam) received 7.5 mg midazolam. Group 4 (clonidine) received 100 Î¼g clonidine. These medications were given orally at sleep time at night of operation and another dose 90 min before operative time. Patients who developed postoperative delirium received 5 mg of melatonin 9 pm for three successive days in a trial to treat delirium. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Statistical analysis was done using the SPSS Software (version 13). RESULTS: Total of 222 patients completed the study. Percentage of postoperative delirium in the control group was 32.65{\%} (16/49 patients). The melatonin group showed a statistically significant decrease in the percentage of postoperative delirium to 9.43{\%} (5/53 patients). Melatonin was successful in treating 58.06{\%} of patients suffered postoperative delirium (36/62 patients) with no difference between different groups. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative delirium is affected with the drug used for preoperative sedation. Melatonin was successful in decreasing postoperative delirium when used preoperatively and in treating more than half of patients developed postoperative delirium when used for three postoperative nights.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common surgical complication in elderly patients. This study investigated the effects of dexmedetomidine on POD and pro-inflammatory markers in elderly patients with hip fracture. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, controlled trial enrolled patients â¥65 years of age who underwent an operation for hip fracture at Beijing JiShuiTan Hospital from October 2016 to January 2017. The patients were divided into the DEX group (injected with dexmedetomidine 0.5 Âµg/kg/h) and the NS group (injected with normal saline). After surgery, the incidence of delirium at postoperative day 1 (T1), 2 (T2), and 3 (T3) was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method delirium scale. Interleukin (IL)-1Î², IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±blood levels were detected at T0 (before surgery), T1, and T3. RESULTS: Data from 240 patients were analyzed, with 120/group (intent-to-treat analysis). Dexmedetomidine decreased POD incidence (18.2 vs. 30.6{\%}, P = 0.033). Compared to T0, all three pro-inflammatory markers were higher at T1 and then decreased at T3 (time interaction, all P < 0.001). IL-6 (P < 0.001) levels were lower in the DEX group at T1, and TNF-Î±(P = 0.003) levels were lower in the DEX group at T1 and T3, but IL-1Î²levels were similar between the two groups. The rate of adverse events was similar in the two groups. CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine reduced the incidence of POD in elderly patients on the first day after hip fracture surgery, and reduced IL-6 and TNF-Î±levels over the first 3 days after surgery.},

	abstract = {The use of intravenous dexmedetomidine during surgery has been shown to suppress inflammatory cytokines peri-operatively. It has also been demonstrated that dexmedetomidine may benefit cognitive function in elderly patients following surgery; however, it is not clear whether dexmedetomidine reduces postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) via the suppression of inflammatory cytokines. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of dexmedetomidine on early POCD and inflammatory cytokines in elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). The study comprised 120 elderly patients undergoing selective LC, who were randomly allocated to receive either dexmedetomidine intravenously (DEX group, n=60) or the same volume of normal saline (control group, n=60). Cognitive function was assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores 1 day prior to surgery, 6 h following surgery and postoperatively on days 1 and 2. Interleukin (IL)-1Î², IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were also measured at these time-points. On the basis of whether the patients had POCD on the first day after surgery, patients were divided into a POCD group and a non-POCD group. Blood cytokine levels were compared between the patients with and without POCD. A total of 100 patients completed both pre- and postoperative MMSE tests. At 1 day following surgery, POCD occurred in 10/50 (20{\%}) patients in the DEX group and in 21/50 (42{\%}) patients in the control group (P=0.017). At 6 h following surgery, IL-1Î², IL-6 and CRP levels showed significant increases (P<0.01) compared with the baseline levels in the two groups. Furthermore, in the control group, CRP levels showed a significant increase on day 1 (P<0.001) and day 2 (P=0.017) postoperatively. In the DEX group compared with the control group, IL-1Î², IL-6 and CRP levels were markedly decreased at 6 h and 1 day after surgery (P<0.01). Concentrations of IL-1Î², IL-6 and CRP were significantly higher in patients who developed POCD on day 1 following surgery than in the patients who did not develop POCD (P<0.05). The findings of the current study support the hypothesis that dexmedetomidine administration during anesthesia decreases the incidence of early POCD, most likely by the mechanism of reduction of the inflammatory response level.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of dexmedetomidine on anesthesia recovery period and postoperative cognitive function of patients after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy and ileal conduit diversion. METHODS: A total of 40 elective patients who would undergo robot-assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy and ileal conduit diversion. They were randomly divided into two groups in a double-blind manner. After pneumoperitoneum established, all patients adopted 40$\,^{\circ}$trendelenberg position. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and bispectral index (BIS) of each patient were recorded at four moments respectively, namely the end of surgery (T0), palinesthesia (T1), extubation (T2), 10 min after extubation (T3). RESULTS: In the dexmedetomidine group, the mean arterial pressure and heart rate decreased at T1 and T2 compared with controls (P<0.05); in addition, the delirium rating scale was lower than the latter (P<0.05) while Ramsay sedation score was significantly higher (P<0.05). POCD was observed on 28 patients, containing 17 controls and 11 dexmedetomidine individuals, one day after operation, and 21 patients (12 controls, 9 dexmedetomidine people) five days after operation. One- and five-day after operation, the levels of TNF-Î±, NSE and IL-6 in the dexmedetomidine group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.05), and serum SOD significantly increased in the former (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine had a neuroprotective effect on anesthesia recovery and postoperative period of the elderly patients undergone robot-assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy, which might be related to the reduction of inflammatory reaction induced by dexmedetomidine.},

DESIGN: Parallel-arm, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Academic medical center in La Jolla, California. PATIENTS: Patients greater than or equal to 18 years undergoing elective pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. INTERVENTIONS: Ramelteon 8 mg or matching placebo starting the night prior to surgery and for a maximum of six nights while in the ICU. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Incident delirium was measured twice daily using the Confusion Assessment Method-ICU. The safety outcome was coma-free days assessed by the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale. One-hundred twenty participants were enrolled and analysis completed in 117. Delirium occurred in 22 of 58 patients allocated to placebo versus 19 of 59 allocated to ramelteon (relative risk, 0.8; 95{\%} CI, 0.5-1.4; p = 0.516). Delirium duration, as assessed by the number of delirium-free days was also similar in both groups (placebo median 2 d {$[$}interquartile range, 2-3 d{$]$} vs ramelteon 3 d {$[$}2-5 d{$]$}; p = 0.181). Coma-free days was also similar between groups (placebo median 2 d {$[$}interquartile range, 1-3 d{$]$} vs ramelteon 3 d {$[$}2-4 d{$]$}; p = 0.210).

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Postoperative delirium, associated with negative consequences including longer hospital stays and worse cognitive and physical outcomes, is frequently accompanied by sleep-wake disturbance. Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy and short-term safety of ramelteon, a melatonin receptor agonist, for the prevention of postoperative delirium in older patients undergoing orthopedic surgery. DESIGN: A quadruple-masked randomized placebo-controlled trial (Clinical Trials.gov NCT02324153) conducted from March 2017 to June 2019. SETTING: Tertiary academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 65 years or older, undergoing elective primary or revision hip or knee replacement. INTERVENTION: Ramelteon (8 mg) or placebo MEASUREMENTS: Eighty participants were randomized to an oral gel cap of ramelteon or placebo for 3 consecutive nights starting the night before surgery. Trained research staff conducted delirium assessments for 3 consecutive days starting on postoperative day (POD) 0, after recovery from anesthesia, and on to POD2. A delirium diagnosis was based upon DSM-5 criteria determined by expert panel consensus. RESULTS: Of 80 participants, five withdrew consent (one placebo, four ramelteon) and four were excluded (four ramelteon) after randomization. Delirium incidence during the 2 days following surgery was 7{\%} (5 of 71) with no difference between the ramelteon versus placebo: 9{\%} (3 of 33) and 5{\%} (2 of 38), respectively. The adjusted odds ratio for postoperative delirium as a function of assignment to the ramelteon treatment arm was 1.28 (95{\%} confidence interval: 0.21-7.93; z-value 0.27; p-value = 0.79). Adverse events were similar between the two groups. CONCLUSION: In older patients undergoing elective primary or revision hip or knee replacement, ramelteon was not efficacious in preventing postoperative delirium.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) are common complications after major surgery among elderly patients. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is less frequently explored for its effects in patients with postoperative neurocognitive disorders. This study investigated the effect and optimal dosage of DEX for patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) on POD and early POCD after major surgery among elderly patients. METHODS: Patients in four groups received continuous infusion of DEX 0, 100, 200, and 400 Î¼g with sufentanil 150 Î¼g for PCA immediately after surgery. POD and POCD were assessed on postoperative days 1, 2, 3, and 7 by using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scales. Furthermore, the incidence of POD and POCD of all the four groups in postoperative 7 days classified by high risk factors (age, education, surgical site, and surgical category), sedation level, postoperative pain intensity, and side effects were assessed. RESULTS: The overall incidence rates of POD and early POCD 7 days after surgery were lower in the DEX 200 Î¼g 400 Î¼g groups than in the DEX 0 Î¼g and 100 Î¼g groups (P < 0.05). Compared with DEX 200 Î¼g, DEX 400 Î¼g reduced early POCD in patients who underwent open surgery (P < 0.05). There were no intergroup differences in the postoperative sedation level, pain intensity, and side effects. CONCLUSION: The continuous infusion of DEX 200 Î¼g or DEX 400 Î¼g in PCA significantly decreased the incidence of POD and early POCD after major surgery without increasing any side effects. Compared with DEX 200 Î¼g, DEX 400 Î¼g was preferred for reducing early POCD in patients who underwent open surgery.},

	abstract = {Perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) is a common complication following thoracic surgery that frequently occurs in patients â¥65 years. PND includes postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) and postoperative delirium (POD). To investigate whether intravenous dexmedetomidine (DEX) is able to improve neurocognitive function in elderly male patients following thoracoscopic lobectomy, a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was performed at the Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical University (Hohhot, China). Patients aged â¥65 years were enrolled and were subjected to thoracic surgery under general anesthesia. A computer-generated randomization sequence was used to randomly assign patients (at a 1:1 ratio) to receive either intravenous DEX (0.5 Âµg/kg per h, from induction until chest closure) or placebo (intravenous normal saline). The primary endpoint was the result of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The secondary endpoints were the results of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and those obtained with the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), as well as the incidence of POCD and POD during the first 7 postoperative days. Other observational indexes included sleep quality at night, self-anxiety scale prior to the operation and 7 days following the operation and the visual analogue scale (VAS) score at rest and during movement on the first and third day following the operation. Furthermore, at 6 h following surgery, the MMSE score in the DEX group was significantly higher than that in the saline group. At 6 h and on the first day postoperatively, the MoCA score in the DEX group was significantly higher than that in the saline group. The incidence of POCD and POD in the DEX group was 13.2 and 7.5{\%}, respectively, while that in the saline group was 35.8 and 11.3{\%}, respectively. There was a significant difference in the incidence of POCD between the two groups (P<0.01). In the DEX group, mean sleep quality was increased, whereas the mean VAS was decreased compared with the corresponding values in the saline group. In conclusion, elderly male patients who underwent thoracoscopic lobectomy under continuous infusion of DEX (0.5 Âµg/kg/h) exhibited a reduced incidence of POCD during the first 7 postoperative days as compared with the placebo group. Furthermore, DEX improved the subjective sleep quality in the first postoperative night, reduced anxiety and alleviated postoperative pain. In addition, it increased the incidence of bradycardia. The present study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (www.chictr.org.cn; registration no. ChiCTR-IPR-17010958).},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate effect of parecoxib sodium pretreatment combined with dexmedetomidine on early postoperative cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients after shoulder arthroscopy. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind study. SETTING: University-affiliated teaching hospital. PATIENTS: One hundred and fifty-two elderly patients scheduled for shoulder arthroscopy. INTERVENTIONS: At 15min before the induction of anesthesia, 152 patients received intravenously parecoxib sodium 40mg and dexmedetomidine at a dose of 0.5Î¼g/kg over 15min, followed by a continuous infusion at a rate of 0.5Î¼g/kg/h until the end of surgery. Then all patients who received postoperative patient-controlled intravenous analgesia were divided 2 groups: sufentanil(0.04Î¼g/kg/h, S group), sufentanil (0.04Î¼g/kg/h) plus dexmedetomidine(0.06Î¼g/kg/h) (SD group). MEASUREMENTS: The mini-mental status examination score in SD group was significantly higher than S group at 1, 2 and 7days after surgery. The incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction during 7days after surgery in S and SD groups was respectively 17.1{\%} and 6.7{\%}. Compared with the S group, the visual analogue scale scores at rest and upon movement were significantly lower at 6, 14, 24, 36 and 48h after surgery in SD group; analgesia pump liquid amount during 24h after surgery and number of rescue analgesia during 48h after surgery were significantly lower in SD group. Jugular venous oxygen partial pressure and jugular venous oxygen saturation values in SD group were significantly higher than S group at postoperative 24h. The occurrence of nausea and vomiting within 48h after surgery in SD group were significantly lower than S group. We found no complications including respiratory depression and sinus bradycardia within 48h after surgery in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Parecoxib sodium pretreatment combined with dexmedetomidine could reduce the incidence of early postoperative cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients. This might be related to the improvement of postoperative analgesia effect and cerebral oxygen metabolism in patients.},

@article{3046,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dexmedetomidine is known to be a sedative. Recent studies suggest that administration of dexmedetomidine can prevent postoperative delirium (POD) which has been confirmed as a common complication after major surgery. However, its effects in patients undergoing oesophagectomy are scarce. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine in reducing POD in elderly patients after transthoracic oesophagectomy with total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA). DESIGN: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Single-centre, tertiary care hospital, November 2016 to September 2018. PATIENTS: Eligible patients (n = 177) undergoing transthoracic oesophagectomy were randomly assigned to receive total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA, n = 87) or dexmedetomidine with TIVA (DEX-TIVA, n = 90). INTERVENTIONS: Patients receiving DEX-TIVA received a loading dose of dexmedetomidine (0.4 Î¼g kg-1), over 15 min, followed by a continuous infusion at a rate of 0.1 Î¼g kg-1 h-1 until 1 h before the end of surgery. Patients receiving TIVA received physiological saline with a similar infusion rate protocol. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the incidence of POD. The secondary endpoints were the incidence of emergence agitation, serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels and haemodynamic profile. RESULTS: All randomised patients were included with planned intention-to-treat analyses for POD. Delirium occurred in 15 (16.7{\%}) of 90 cases given dexmedetomidine, and in 32 (36.8{\%}) of 87 cases given saline (P = 0.0036). The DEX-TIVA group showed less frequent emergence agitation than the TIVA group (22.1 vs. 48.0{\%}, P = 0.0058). The incremental change in surgery-induced IL-6 levels was greater in the TIVA group than DEX-TIVA group (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Adding peri-operative dexmedetomidine to a total intravenous anaesthetic safely reduces POD and emergence agitation in elderly patients undergoing open transthoracic oesophagectomy. These benefits were associated with a postoperative reduction in circulating levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and stabilisation of the haemodynamic profile.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate the feasibility of Ramelteon for the prevention of delirium after lung cancer surgery in elderly patients. METHODS: Medical records of patients over 70 years old, who underwent anatomical pulmonary resection for lung cancer at our institution from January 2013 to December 2015, were reviewed. Patients treated in 2013 and 2014 were used as a control group. Ramelteon was administered daily for 7 days after surgery. The incidence of delirium was determined based on the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC). Scores of â¥4 and 1-3 points were used for the diagnoses of delirium and a pre-delirious state, respectively. RESULTS: There were 24 patients in the Ramelteon group and 58 patients in the control group. ICDSC scores of â¥4 points were found for no patients in the Ramelteon group and 5 (9{\%}) in the control group, whereas 21 (88{\%}) and 49 (85{\%}) patients, in the respective groups, had ICDSC scores of 0 points. The average incidence of events, associated with delirium, showed a trend of being lower in the Ramelteon group (0.25 $\pm$0.74 vs 1.58 $\pm$4.93, P = 0.061), and all events in the Ramelteon group occurred on the day of surgery. Thus, only one day was required for complete recovery from delirium in the Ramelteon group, whereas 8 days were needed in the control group. The peak delirious state occurred after 5 days in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Ramelteon is likely to reduce the incidence and intensity of delirium after surgery for lung cancer in elderly patients.},

@article{2866,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common and serious postoperative complication. Subanaesthetic ketamine is often administered intraoperatively for postoperative analgesia, and some evidence suggests that ketamine prevents delirium. The primary purpose of this trial was to assess the effectiveness of ketamine for prevention of postoperative delirium in older adults. METHODS: The Prevention of Delirium and Complications Associated with Surgical Treatments {$[$}PODCAST{$]$} study is a multicentre, international randomised trial that enrolled adults older than 60 years undergoing major cardiac and non-cardiac surgery under general anaesthesia. Using a computer-generated randomisation sequence we randomly assigned patients to one of three groups in blocks of 15 to receive placebo (normal saline), low-dose ketamine (0Â·5 mg/kg), or high dose ketamine (1Â·0 mg/kg) after induction of anaesthesia, before surgical incision. Participants, clinicians, and investigators were blinded to group assignment. Delirium was assessed twice daily in the first 3 postoperative days using the Confusion Assessment Method. We did analyses by intention-to-treat and assessed adverse events. This trial is registered with clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT01690988. FINDINGS: Between Feb 6, 2014, and June 26, 2016, 1360 patients were assessed, and 672 were randomly assigned, with 222 in the placebo group, 227 in the 0Â·5 mg/kg ketamine group, and 223 in the 1Â·0 mg/kg ketamine group. There was no difference in delirium incidence between patients in the combined ketamine groups and the placebo group (19Â·45{\%} vs 19Â·82{\%}, respectively; absolute difference 0Â·36{\%}, 95{\%} CI -6Â·07 to 7Â·38, p=0Â·92). There were more postoperative hallucinations (p=0Â·01) and nightmares (p=0Â·03) with increasing ketamine doses compared with placebo. Adverse events (cardiovascular, renal, infectious, gastrointestinal, and bleeding), whether viewed individually (p value for each >0Â·40) or collectively (36Â·9{\%} in placebo, 39Â·6{\%} in 0Â·5 mg/kg ketamine, and 40Â·8{\%} in 1Â·0 mg/kg ketamine groups, p=0Â·69), did not differ significantly across groups. INTERPRETATION: A single subanaesthetic dose of ketamine did not decrease delirium in older adults after major surgery, and might cause harm by inducing negative experiences.

	abstract = {Pregabalin and dexmedetomidine have been introduced to manage postoperative pain. This study evaluated the effect of the 2 drugs combined on pain in patients undergoing total knee or hip arthroplasty. A total of 124 patients undergoing total knee or hip arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia were randomly assigned to either group C (n=31, placebo), group P (n=33, pregabalin), group PD (n=29, pregabalin and dexmedetomidine), or group D (n=31, dexmedetomidine). One hour before spinal anesthesia, patients received 150 mg of pregabalin or placebo orally, and a bolus dose of 0.5 Âµg/ kg of intravenous dexmedetomidine was given over 10 minutes before induction of spinal anesthesia. This was followed by a continuous infusion of 0.5 Âµg/kg/h or the same calculated volume of normal saline until completion of the surgery. Clinically relevant pain for 24 hours postoperatively, including time to first analgesic request, visual analog scale score, ketorolac dose, and volume of patient-controlled analgesia consumed, was recorded. Group C had significantly longer time to first analgesic request, higher visual analog scale scores at rest and on movement, higher ketorolac dose, and higher volume of patient-controlled analgesia for the first 24 hours postoperatively compared with the other groups. Although group PD and group D had less clinically relevant pain than group P, group PD and group D were not significantly different. Dexmedetomidine was more effective than pregabalin for clinically relevant pain. Pregabalin and dexmedetomidine combined had no synergic effect compared with dexmedetomidine alone. {$[$}Orthopedics. 2018; 41(6):365-370.{$]$}.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Postoperative delirium is common following cardiac surgery and may be affected by choice of analgesic and sedative. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of postoperative intravenous (IV) acetaminophen (paracetamol) vs placebo combined with IV propofol vs dexmedetomidine on postoperative delirium among older patients undergoing cardiac surgery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, placebo-controlled, factorial clinical trial among 120 patients aged 60 years or older undergoing on-pump coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery or combined CABG/valve surgeries at a US center. Enrollment was September 2015 to April 2018, with follow-up ending in April 2019. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to 1 of 4 groups receiving postoperative analgesia with IV acetaminophen or placebo every 6 hours for 48 hours and postoperative sedation with dexmedetomidine or propofol starting at chest closure and continued for up to 6 hours (acetaminophen and dexmedetomidine: n = 29; placebo and dexmedetomidine: n = 30; acetaminophen and propofol: n = 31; placebo and propofol: n = 30). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was incidence of postoperative in-hospital delirium by the Confusion Assessment Method. Secondary outcomes included delirium duration, cognitive decline, breakthrough analgesia within the first 48 hours, and ICU and hospital length of stay. RESULTS: Among 121 patients randomized (median age, 69 years; 19 women {$[$}15.8{\%}{$]$}), 120 completed the trial. Patients treated with IV acetaminophen had a significant reduction in delirium (10{\%} vs 28{\%} placebo; difference, -18{\%} {$[$}95{\%} CI, -32{\%} to -5{\%}{$]$}; P = .01; HR, 2.8 {$[$}95{\%} CI, 1.1-7.8{$]$}). Patients receiving dexmedetomidine vs propofol had no significant difference in delirium (17{\%} vs 21{\%}; difference, -4{\%} {$[$}95{\%} CI, -18{\%} to 10{\%}{$]$}; P = .54; HR, 0.8 {$[$}95{\%} CI, 0.4-1.9{$]$}). There were significant differences favoring acetaminophen vs placebo for 3 prespecified secondary outcomes: delirium duration (median, 1 vs 2 days; difference, -1 {$[$}95{\%} CI, -2 to 0{$]$}), ICU length of stay (median, 29.5 vs 46.7 hours; difference, -16.7 {$[$}95{\%} CI, -20.3 to -0.8{$]$}), and breakthrough analgesia (median, 322.5 vs 405.3 Âµg morphine equivalents; difference, -83 {$[$}95{\%} CI, -154 to -14{$]$}). For dexmedetomidine vs propofol, only breakthrough analgesia was significantly different (median, 328.8 vs 397.5 Âµg; difference, -69 {$[$}95{\%} CI, -155 to -4{$]$}; P = .04). Fourteen patients in both the placebo-dexmedetomidine and acetaminophen-propofol groups (46{\%} and 45{\%}) and 7 in the acetaminophen-dexmedetomidine and placebo-propofol groups (24{\%} and 23{\%}) had hypotension. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among older patients undergoing cardiac surgery, postoperative scheduled IV acetaminophen, combined with IV propofol or dexmedetomidine, reduced in-hospital delirium vs placebo. Additional research, including comparison of IV vs oral acetaminophen and other potentially opioid-sparing analgesics, on the incidence of postoperative delirium is warranted.

	abstract = {We investigated the effects of ulinastatin on early postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) after one-lung ventilation (OLV) surgery in elderly patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Eighty elderly patients with preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy scheduling for radical esophagectomy under OLV were recruited. They were randomly divided into an ulinastatin pretreatment group (U group, n = 40) and a control group (C group, n = 40). The U group received 10,000 U/kg ulinastatin before anesthesia and 5000 U/kg daily on postoperative days 1 to 3, while C group received saline. Levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, C-reactive protein (CRP), and S-100Î²protein were assayed before surgery, at the end of surgery, and on postoperative days 1 and 3. Patients underwent cognitive assessment 1 day before and 7 days after surgery. 38 patients in U group and 37 patients in C group completed the neuropsychological tests. The U group had a lower incidence of POCD than C group (23.7 {\%} versus 45.9 {\%}, P = 0.043). The levels of S-100Î²protein, IL-6, IL-10, and CRP in both groups increased after surgery. The postoperative concentrations of S-100Î²protein, IL-6, and CRP in U group were lower than those in C group. On postoperative day 3, compared with C group, the level of CRP in U group was lower, while that of IL-10 was higher. These findings demonstrate that ulinastatin can attenuate the elevation of S100Î²protein levels and the incidence of POCD, most likely by the mechanism of reducing serum IL-6 and CRP levels and increasing IL-10 levels.},

@article{2578,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a serious and frequent complication after surgery, especially in elderly patients. Ketamine is an N-methyl D-aspartic acid receptor antagonist with demonstrated neuroprotective effects. An intravenous bolus of a sub-anesthetic dose (0.5 mg/kg) of ketamine can reduce postoperative delirium (POD) and POCD after cardiac surgery. But, the influence of ketamine on early POCD after non-cardiac surgery is unclear. OBJECTIVES: The current study aimed to evaluate the influence of ketamine on early postoperative cognitive function after orthopedic surgery in elderly patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty six elderly patients (> 60-years-old), scheduled for elective orthopedic surgery during general anesthesia (duration of anesthesia > two hours) were enrolled. Patients received intravenous bolus, a total of 3 mL mixed with 0.9{\%} normal saline and 0.5 mg/kg ketamine (K group) or 3 mL of 0.9{\%} normal saline (N group). Three neurocognitive function tests (mini-mental status examination, trail-making test, digit substitution test), and c-reactive protein (CRP) concentration were determined before surgery and on postoperative day one (POD 1) and postoperative day six (POD 6). RESULTS: The two groups had similar demographic characteristics except for the gender. Surgical and anesthetic data were not significantly different. A statistically significant difference was observed in comparison of trail-making test score. Trail-making test score increased more in the N group (52.5 points) than the K group (13 points) at POD 1 (P = 0.047) compared with baseline scores. There were no significant differences in the mini-mental status examination, digit substitution test and CRP concentration at POD 1 and POD 6 between the two groups. POCD (the two Z-scores in more than two tests or the combined Z-score was 1.96 or more) was present in one patient (4{\%}) in the K group at POD 6 (P = 0.98). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of POCD was not significantly influenced by a bolus dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) after orthopedic surgery in elderly patients. There were no negative effects of ketamine on early POCD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Commonly used sedatives/analgesics can increase the risk of postoperative complications, including delirium. This double-blinded study assessed the neurobehavioral, hemodynamic, and sedative characteristics of dexmedetomidine compared with morphine-based regimen after cardiac surgery at equivalent levels of sedation and analgesia. METHODS: A total of 306 patients at least 60 yr old were randomized to receive dexmedetomidine (0.1-0.7 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1)) or morphine (10-70 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1)) with open-label propofol titrated to a target Motor Activity Assessment Scale of 2-4. Primary outcome was the prevalence of delirium measured daily via Confusion Assessment Method for intensive care. Secondary outcomes included ventilation time, additional sedation/analgesia, and hemodynamic and adverse effects. RESULTS: Of all sedation assessments, 75.2{\%} of dexmedetomidine and 79.6{\%} (P = 0.516) of morphine treatment were in the target range. Delirium incidence was comparable between dexmedetomidine 13 (8.6{\%}) and morphine 22 (15.0{\%}) (relative risk 0.571, 95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$} 0.256-1.099, P = 0.088), however, dexmedetomidine-managed patients spent 3 fewer days (2 {$[$}1-7{$]$} versus 5 {$[$}2-12{$]$}) in delirium (95{\%} CI 1.09-6.67, P = 0.0317). The incidence of delirium was significantly less in a small subgroup requiring intraaortic balloon pump and treated with dexmedetomidine (3 of 20 {$[$}15{\%}{$]$} versus 9 of 25 {$[$}36{\%}{$]$}) (relative risk 0.416, 95{\%} CI 0.152-0.637, P = 0.001). Dexmedetomidine-treated patients were more likely to be extubated earlier (relative risk 1.27, 95{\%} CI 1.01-1.60, P = 0.040, log-rank P = 0.036), experienced less systolic hypotension (23{\%} versus 38.1{\%}, P = 0.006), required less norepinephrine (P < 0.001), but had more bradycardia (16.45{\%} versus 6.12{\%}, P = 0.006) than morphine treatment. CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine reduced the duration but not the incidence of delirium after cardiac surgery with effective analgesia/sedation, less hypotension, less vasopressor requirement, and more bradycardia versus morphine regimen.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delirium is a postoperative complication that occurs frequently in patients older than 65 years, and presages adverse outcomes. We investigated whether prophylactic low-dose dexmedetomidine, a highly selective Î±(2) adrenoceptor agonist, could safely decrease the incidence of delirium in elderly patients after non-cardiac surgery. METHODS: We did this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in two tertiary-care hospitals in Beijing, China. We enrolled patients aged 65 years or older, who were admitted to intensive care units after non-cardiac surgery, with informed consent. We used a computer-generated randomisation sequence (in a 1:1 ratio) to randomly assign patients to receive either intravenous dexmedetomidine (0Â·1 Î¼g/kg per h, from intensive care unit admission on the day of surgery until 0800 h on postoperative day 1), or placebo (intravenous normal saline). Participants, care providers, and investigators were all masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was the incidence of delirium, assessed twice daily with the Confusion Assessment Method for intensive care units during the first 7 postoperative days. Analyses were done by intention-to-treat and safety populations. This study is registered with Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, www.chictr.org.cn, number ChiCTR-TRC-10000802. FINDINGS: Between Aug 17, 2011, and Nov 20, 2013, of 2016 patients assessed, 700 were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (n=350) or dexmedetomidine (n=350). The incidence of postoperative delirium was significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group (32 {$[$}9{\%}{$]$} of 350 patients) than in the placebo group (79 {$[$}23{\%}{$]$} of 350 patients; odds ratio {$[$}OR{$]$} 0Â·35, 95{\%} CI 0Â·22-0Â·54; p<0Â·0001). Regarding safety, the incidence of hypertension was higher with placebo (62 {$[$}18{\%}{$]$} of 350 patients) than with dexmedetomidine (34 {$[$}10{\%}{$]$} of 350 patients; 0Â·50, 0Â·32-0Â·78; p=0Â·002). Tachycardia was also higher in patients given placebo (48 {$[$}14{\%}{$]$} of 350 patients) than in patients given dexmedetomidine (23 {$[$}7{\%}{$]$} of 350 patients; 0Â·44, 0Â·26-0Â·75; p=0Â·002). Occurrence of hypotension and bradycardia did not differ between groups. INTERPRETATION: For patients aged over 65 years who are admitted to the intensive care unit after non-cardiac surgery, prophylactic low-dose dexmedetomidine significantly decreases the occurrence of delirium during the first 7 days after surgery. The therapy is safe. FUNDING: Braun Anaesthesia Scientific Research Fund and Wu Jieping Medical Foundation, Beijing, China.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Postoperative delirium is a serious and common complication, it occurs in 13-50{\%} of elderly patients after major surgery, and presages adverse outcomes. Emerging literature suggests that dexmedetomidine sedation in critical care units (intensive care unit) is associated with reduced incidence of delirium. However, few studies have investigated whether postoperative continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine could safely decrease the incidence of delirium in elderly patients admitted to general surgical wards after noncardiac surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in patients aged 65 years or older undergoing major elective noncardiac surgery without a planned ICU stay. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive either dexmedetomidine (0.1 Î¼g/kg/h) or placebo (0.9{\%} normal saline) immediately after surgery though patient-controlled intravenous analgesia device. The primary outcome was the incidence of delirium during the first 5 postoperative days. Secondary outcomes included postoperative subjective pain scores and subjective sleep quality. The study dates were from January 2018 to January 2019. RESULTS: A total of 557 patients were randomly assigned to receive either dexmedetomidine (n=281) or placebo (n=276). The incidence of postoperative delirium had no difference between the dexmedetomidine and placebo groups (11.7{\%} {$[$}33 of 281{$]$} vs 13.8{\%} {$[$}38 of 276{$]$}, P=0.47). Compared with placebo group, patients in dexmedetomidine group reported significant lower numerical rating score pain scores at 3, 12, 24, and 48 hrs after surgery (all P<0.05) and significant improved Richards Campbell Sleep Questionnaire results during the first 3 postoperative days (all P<0.0001). Dexmedetomidine-related adverse events were similar between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Postoperative continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine did not decrease the incidence of postoperative delirium in elderly patients admitted to general surgical wards after elective noncardiac surgery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a serious complication after cardiac surgery. Use of dexmedetomidine to prevent delirium is controversial. The authors hypothesized that dexmedetomidine sedation after cardiac surgery would reduce the incidence of POD. METHODS: After institutional ethics review board approval, and informed consent, a single-blinded, prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted in patients 60 yr or older undergoing cardiac surgery. Patients with a history of serious mental illness, delirium, and severe dementia were excluded. Upon admission to intensive care unit (ICU), patients received either dexmedetomidine (0.4 Î¼g/kg bolus followed by 0.2 to 0.7 Î¼g kg h infusion) or propofol (25 to 50 Î¼g kg min infusion) according to a computer-generated randomization code in blocks of four. Assessment of delirium was performed with confusion assessment method for ICU or confusion assessment method after discharge from ICU at 12-h intervals during the 5 postoperative days. Primary outcome was the incidence of POD. RESULTS: POD was present in 16 of 91 (17.5{\%}) and 29 of 92 (31.5{\%}) patients in dexmedetomidine and propofol groups, respectively (odds ratio, 0.46; 95{\%} CI, 0.23 to 0.92; P = 0.028). Median onset of POD was on postoperative day 2 (1 to 4 days) versus 1 (1 to 4 days), P = 0.027, and duration of POD 2 days (1 to 4 days) versus 3 days (1 to 5 days), P = 0.04, in dexmedetomidine and propofol groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: When compared with propofol, dexmedetomidine sedation reduced incidence, delayed onset, and shortened duration of POD in elderly patients after cardiac surgery. The absolute risk reduction for POD was 14{\%}, with a number needed to treat of 7.1.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute postoperative cognitive dysfunction is characterized by neurocognitive dysfunction and confusion. In this study, we compared the cognitive status of a geriatric population undergoing ophthalmic surgery, as assessed by the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) before and after ketamine administration. METHODS: Eighty patients were enrolled and randomly assigned in a double-blind study to receive either ketamine (0.3 mg/kg dose) or physiologic solution (control group). Sixty-five (control, n = 32; ketamine, n = 33) patients completed the trial. Cognitive performance was assessed with an abbreviated version of the SPMSQ. Measurements of analgesia, sedation, intraocular pressure, and hemodynamic variables were recorded. RESULTS: With respect to cognitive performance, the baseline evaluation was similar for the control and ketamine groups. Postoperative evaluation showed an improvement only in the ketamine group. No increase in intraocular pressure or a secondary nystagmus was observed. The average dose of midazolam was higher in the control group, but the difference was not clinically significant. After surgery, analgesic behavior was better in the ketamine group than in the control group. There were no differences between groups in the sedation scale or in hemodynamic variables. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of 0.3 mg/kg ketamine during ophthalmic surgery in geriatric patients changed their cognitive status as assessed by the SPMSQ, decreased the required dose of anesthetics, and produced no increase in intraocular pressure or in hemodynamic variables. However, because the evaluation only analyzed the immediate effects of the administered drug, further research will be required to examine the impact of ketamine on the postoperative cognitive performance of geriatric patients before the drug can be formally recommended for this purpose.},

@article{2173,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a frequent complication in older patients. Dexmedetomidine might be effective in decreasing the incidence of POD. We hypothesised that adding low-dose rate dexmedetomidine infusion to a propofol sedation regimen would have fewer side-effects and would counteract the possible delirium producing properties of propofol, resulting in a lower risk of POD than propofol with placebo. METHODS: In this double-blind placebo-controlled trial, patients â¥60 yr old undergoing on-pump cardiac surgery were randomised 1:1 to the following postoperative sedative regimens: a propofol infusion and dexmedetomidine (0.4 Î¼g kg(-1) h(-1)) or a propofol infusion and saline 0.9{\%} (placebo group). The study drug was started at chest closure and continued for 10 h. The primary endpoint was in-hospital POD, assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method and chart review method. RESULTS: POD over the course of hospital stay occurred in 31/177 (18{\%}) and 33/172 (19{\%}) patients in the dexmedetomidine and placebo arm, respectively (P=0.687; odds ratio=0.89; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.52-1.54). The incidence of POD in the intensive care alone, or on the ward alone, was also not significantly different between the groups. Subjects in the dexmedetomidine group spent less median time in a delirious state (P=0.026). Median administered postoperative norepinephrine was significantly higher in the dexmedetomidine group (P<0.001). One patient in the dexmedetomidine group and 10 patients in the placebo group died in the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Adding low-dose rate dexmedetomidine to a sedative regimen based on propofol did not result in a different risk of in-hospital delirium in older patients undergoing cardiac surgery. With a suggestion of both harm and benefit in secondary outcomes, supplementing postoperative propofol with dexmedetomidine cannot be recommended based on this study.

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Postoperative delirium occurs in 10{\%} to 60{\%} of elderly patients having major surgery and is associated with longer hospital stays, increased hospital costs, and 1-year mortality. Emerging literature suggests that dexmedetomidine sedation in critical care units is associated with reduced incidence of delirium. However, intraoperative use of dexmedetomidine for prevention of delirium has not been well studied. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether an intraoperative infusion of dexmedetomidine reduces postoperative delirium. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that randomly assigned patients to dexmedetomidine or saline placebo infused during surgery and for 2 hours in the recovery room. Patients were assessed daily for postoperative delirium (primary outcome) and secondarily for postoperative cognitive decline. Participants were elderly (>68 years) patients undergoing major elective noncardiac surgery. The study dates were February 2008 to May 2014. INTERVENTIONS: Dexmedetomidine infusion (0.5 Âµg/kg/h) during surgery and up to 2 hours in the recovery room. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary hypothesis tested was that intraoperative dexmedetomidine administration would reduce postoperative delirium. Secondarily, the study examined the correlation between dexmedetomidine use and postoperative cognitive change. RESULTS: In total, 404 patients were randomized; 390 completed in-hospital delirium assessments (median {$[$}interquartile range{$]$} age, 74.0 {$[$}71.0-78.0{$]$} years; 51.3{\%} {$[$}200 of 390{$]$} female). There was no difference in postoperative delirium between the dexmedetomidine and placebo groups (12.2{\%} {$[$}23 of 189{$]$} vs 11.4{\%} {$[$}23 of 201{$]$}, P = .94). After adjustment for age and educational level, there was no difference in the postoperative cognitive performance between treatment groups at 3 months and 6 months. Adverse events were comparably distributed in the treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Intraoperative dexmedetomidine does not prevent postoperative delirium. The reduction in delirium previously demonstrated in numerous surgical intensive care unit studies was not observed, which underscores the importance of timing when administering the drug to prevent delirium.

Due to the multifactorial origin of delirium and according to international guidelines (e.g., American Geriatrics Society; Prevention and Management of Pain, Agitation/Sedation, Delirium, Immobility, and Sleep Disruption (PADIS) guideline), there are several but no incontestable options for prevention and symptomatic treatment. The purpose of the Baden PRIDe (Prevention and Reduction of Incidence of postoperative Delirium) trial was to determine whether postoperative cognitive dysfunction and delirium could be prevented by the combination of possible preventive agents such as haloperidol and ketamine. In addition, pre- and postoperative levels of the biomarkers cortisol, neuron specific enolase (NSE) and S100Î²were measured to investigate their dynamics in delirious and non-delirious patients after surgery. DESIGN: The Baden PRIDe Trial was an investigator-initiated, phase IV, two-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial. SETTING: Perioperative care. PATIENTS: 182 adult patients that underwent elective or emergency surgery under general or combined (i.e., general and regional) anaesthesia. INTERVENTIONS: Pre-anaesthetic, pharmacologic prevention of postoperative brain dysfunction with haloperidol, ketamine, and the combination of both vs. placebo. MEASUREMENTS: Assessment of cognitive performance pre- and postoperatively with the MMSE, the DOS, the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (Nu-DESC) or the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) during ICU stay. MAIN RESULTS: None of the three study arms - haloperidol, ketamine, or both drugs combined - was significantly superior to placebo for prevention of postoperative brain dysfunction and delirium (P = 0.39). Measured levels of postoperative cortisol were significantly higher in delirious patients. S-100Î²levels were significantly higher in all postoperative outcome groups (cognitive impairment, delirium, no cognitive decline), whereas postoperative NSE levels declined in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: The study results offer no possibility for a novel recommendation for prevention of postoperative cognitive decline including delirium. Perioperative S-100Î²trajectories in patients with cognitive deterioration suggest affection of glial cells in particular.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Delirium is the most common postoperative neurological complication and some evidence suggests that dexmedetomidine is associated with a decreased incidence of delirium. This study is designed to assess the effect of dexmedetomidine on postoperative delirium (POD) in elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: Sixty geriatric patients with MCI were enrolled and ramdomly divided into two groups by a computer-generated randomisation sequence: dexmedetomidine group (D group) and normal saline group (C group). Patients in D group received a loading dose of 0.5 Î¼g/kg dexmedetomidine over 10 minutes before anesthesia induction, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.4 Î¼gÂ·kg(-1)Â·h(-1) until 30 minutes before the end of surgery; equal volume of normal saline was given in C group. Blood samples were extracted to detect the concentration of cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-Î±(TNF-Î±), interleukin-10 (IL-10), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) before anesthesia induction (T(1)), before suture (T(2)), and 30 minutes after surgery (T(3)). Postoperative recovery times were recorded. Delirium was assessed with the 3-Minute Diagnostic Interview for confusion assessment method during the first 7 days postoperatively. RESULTS: POD occurred in 10 (33.3{\%}) of 30 patients in C group, and in 3 (10{\%}) of 30 patients given dexmedetomidine (odds ratio {$[$}OR{$]$} 0.222, 95{\%} CI 0.054-0.914; P = 0.028). The serum concentrations of TNF-Î±, MMP-9, and GFAP were significantly increased and IL-10 was decreased in the C group than in the D group at T(2) and T(3). No differences were observed between groups in the level of HO-1. Analysis using random-effect multivariable logistic regression indicated that POD was associated with GFAP (odds ratio {$[$}OR{$]$} 16.691, 95{\%} CI 2.288-121.746; P = 0.005). The positive predictive ability of the multivariate logistic regression model tested by ROC analysis showed an area under the curve of 0.713 (95{\%} CI, 0.584-0.842). CONCLUSIONS: Dexmedetomidine can alleviate POD in elderly patients with MCI and may be related to reduce the neuroinflammation by lowering the permeability of blood-brain barrier.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine if ketamine attenuates postoperative delirium concomitant with an anti-inflammatory effect in patients undergoing cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass. DESIGN: A prospective randomized study. SETTING: A Veterans Affairs medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Cardiac surgical patients. INTERVENTIONS: Patients at least 55 years of age randomly received placebo (0.9{\%} saline, n = 29) or an intravenous bolus of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg intravenously, n = 29) during anesthetic induction in the presence of fentanyl and etomidate. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Delirium was assessed by using the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist before and after surgery. Serum C-reactive protein concentrations were determined before and 1 day after surgery. The incidence of postoperative delirium was lower (p = 0.01, Fisher exact test) in patients receiving ketamine (3{\%}) compared with placebo (31{\%}). Postoperative C-reactive protein concentration was also lower (p < 0.05) in the ketamine-treated patients compared with the placebo-treated patients. The odds of developing postoperative delirium were greater for patients receiving placebo compared with ketamine treatment (odds ratio = 12.6; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.5-107.5; logistic regression). CONCLUSIONS: After cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass, ketamine attenuates postoperative delirium concomitant with an anti-inflammatory effect.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effects of dexmedetomidine on cerebral oxygen saturation {$[$}Sct(O2){$]$} and postoperative cognitive function in elderly patients undergoing minimally invasive coronary artery bypass graft surgery. METHODS: Sixty elderly patients who received minimally invasive coronary artery bypass graft surgery were randomly equally divided into dexmedetomidine group (group D) and control group (group N). The patients in group D were pumped with 1 Î¼g/kg dexmedetomidine for 15 min before incision, followed by continuous pumping at 0.3-0.5 Î¼g/(kgÂ·h) till the end of the operation. The patients in group N received same dose of normal saline during the operation. Sct(O2) was monitored at pre-induction (T0), post-induction (T1), 30 min (T2) after single-lung ventilation, and after surgery (T3). Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) was used to assess the cognitive function at 1 day before, 72 hour and 7 days after surgery. RESULTS: Sct(O2) level in group D was significantly higher than that in group N at T2 (P < 0.05). Sct(O2) level was statistically lower at T2 than that at T0, T1 and T3 in the same group N (P < 0.05). At 72 h and 7d after operation, the incidence of cognitive dysfunction in group D was markedly lower than that in group N (P < 0.05), the MMSE score in group D was markedly higher than those in group N, but was significantly lower than that before surgery (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine can alleviate the decrease of Sct(O2) during single-lung ventilation, improve postoperative cognitive function, and reduce the incidence of POCD in elderly patients with minimally invasive coronary artery bypass surgery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Peripheral nerve block is a preferable method for elderly patients receiving hip arthroplasty. Sedation with dexmedetomidine may reduce postoperative delirium (POD). The aim of this study was to investigate whether intraoperative sedation with dexmedetomidine, as a supplementary to peripheral nerve block for elderly patients receiving total hip arthroplasty, can decrease the prevalence of POD. METHODS: A prospective, randomized controlled study was conducted with patients 65 years of age or older who underwent total hip arthroplasty between June 2016 and June 2017. The patients were randomly assigned to receive a lumbosacral plexus plus T12 paravertebral block supplemented with propofol or dexmedetomidine for sedation. Incidence of POD was the primary endpoint and was determined with the confusion assessment method, and incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) was assessed with the mini-mental state examination. The time of ambulation, discharge time, and complications over a 30-day postsurgery period were also recorded. RESULTS: A total of 296 patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups. The patients sedated with dexmedetomidine had lower incidences of POD and POCD and were out of bed and discharged sooner than the patients sedated with propofol. There was no difference in complications between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: As a supplementary to peripheral nerve block, intraoperative sedation with dexmedetomidine could be associated with a lower incidence of POD, which may have benefits on reducing the incidence of early POCD and offering a better short-term recovery for elderly patients receiving hip arthroplasty.},

	abstract = {The aim of the investigation is to clarify the beneficial sedative effects for patients with postoperative intubation in the intensive care unit (ICU) after oral and maxillofacial surgery. Forty patients with postoperative intubation were divided into two groups in method of random number table: midazolam group and dexmedetomidine group. The Ramsay score, the behavioral pain scale (BPS) score, SpO(2), HR, MAP, and RR were recorded before sedation (T0), 30 minutes (T1), 1 hour (T2), 2 hours (T3), 6 hours (T4), and 12 hours (T5) after dexmedetomidine or midazolam initiation in intensive care unit, and 10 minutes after extubation (T6). The rate of incidences of side effects was calculated. Sedation with midazolam was as good as standard sedation with dexmedetomidine in maintaining target sedation level. The BPS score in the midazolam group was higher than that in the dexmedetomidine group. The time of tracheal catheter extraction in the dexmedetomidine group was shorter than that in the midazolam group (p â¤0.001). The incidence of bradycardia in the dexmedetomidine group was higher than that in the midazolam group (p = 0.028). There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of hypotension between the two groups (p = 0.732). The incidence of respiratory depression of group midazolam was higher than that of group dexmedetomidine (p = 0.018). The incidence of delirium in the dexmedetomidine group was significantly lower than that in the midazolam group, and the difference was statistically significant (p = 0.003). Dexmedetomidine and midazolam can meet the needs for sedation in ICU patients. And dexmedetomidine can improve patients' ability to communicate pain compared with midazolam.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common and serious surgical complication among the elderly, especially in those with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is neuroprotective for delirium. In this study, we determined the effect of intravenously administered DEX during general anesthesia on POD in elderly aMCI patients undergoing elective hip joint or knee joint or shoulder joint replacement surgery. METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized parallel-group study of aMCI (n = 80) and normal elderly patients (n = 120). Prior to surgery, all subjects underwent neuropsychological assessment and were assigned to one of four groups: the aMCI DEX group (MD group, n = 40), the aMCI normal saline group (MN group, n = 40), the control DEX group (CD group, n = 60), and the control normal saline group (CN group, n = 60). The confusion assessment method was used to screen POD on postoperative days 1, 3, and 7. RESULTS: We found patients age was positively correlated with POD incidence in the MN group (p < 0.05) but not in the CN group (p < 0.05). DEX treatment significantly decreased POD incidence in both control and aMCI groups relative to their respective placebo groups (all p < 0.05). The fraction of patients whose normal cognitive function was not restored by day 7 after surgery was significantly higher in the MN group than the MD and CN groups (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggested that DEX treatment during surgery significantly reduced POD incidence in both normal and aMCI elderly patients, suggesting that it may be an effective option for the prevention of POD.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate efficacy of combined use of parecoxib and dexmedetomidine on postoperative pain and early cognitive dysfunction after laparoscopic cholecystectomy for elderly patients. METHODS: The present prospective randomized controlled study included a total of 80 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgery during January 2016 to November 2017 in our hospital. All patients were randomly divided into 4 groups, the parecoxib group, the dexmedetomidine group, the parecoxib and dexmedetomidine combined group, and the control group. Demographic data and clinical data were collected. Indexes of heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), levels of jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjvO2) and jugular venous oxygen pressure (PjvO2) were recorded at different time points before and during the surgery. The mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score, Ramsay score and Visual Analogue Score (VAS) were measured. RESULTS: Levels of both SjvO2 and PjvO2 were significantly higher in parecoxib group, dexmedetomidine group and the combined group than the control group. Meanwhile, levels of both SjvO2 and PjvO2 in the combined group were the highest. VAS scores were significantly lower in the combined group than all other groups, and total patient controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) pressing times within 48 h after surgery were the lowest in the combined group. Both Ramsay and MMSE scores were the highest in the combined group compared with other groups, while were the lowest in the control group. CONCLUSION: The combined use of parecoxib and dexmedetomidine could reduce the postoperative pain and improve the postoperative sedation and cognitive conditions of patients after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dexmedetomidine potentially confers an advantage to reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium (POD) in surgical patients. Anti-inflammation is important effect of this sedative drug. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether the effect of dexmedetomidine on the postoperative cognitive function is via inhibiting peripheral inflammation. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, controlled study was conducted with patients 65 years of age or above who received total knee arthroplasty from January 2019 to May 2019. The patients were randomly assigned to receive spinal anesthesia supplemented with propofol or dexmedetomidine for sedation. The incidence of POD was the primary endpoint and was evaluated with the Confusion Assessment Method, and incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction was assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination. Blood samples were collected postoperatively to test the plasma concentrations of interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-Î±, and S100Î². RESULTS: A total of 366 patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups. Patients who received dexmedetomidine sedation had lower incidences of POD and better postoperative cognitive function than patients sedated with propofol. There was no difference in postoperative plasma concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-Î±and interleukin-6 between the 2 groups. The concentration of S100Î²48 hours after surgery was higher in patients sedated with propofol than in patients who received dexmedetomidine sedation. CONCLUSION: Intraoperative sedation with dexmedetomidine conferred better postoperative neurocognitive function for elderly patients who received total knee arthroplasty. This effect was unrelated to the modulation of dexmedetomidine on peripheral inflammation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study aimed to compare the effects of preoperative administration of midazolam and dexmedetomidine on cognitive dysfunction prevention after cataract surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This research was a double-blind controlled clinical trial. In this study, 150 candidates for cataract surgery under general anesthesia, over 65 years, and similar to American Society of Anesthesiologists I and II characteristics were selected as the sample and randomly assigned to three groups. Participants of these three groups were treated with 0.1 mg/kg of midazolam, 1 Î¼g/kg of dexmedetomidine, and the same volume of normal saline (control), respectively. Hemodynamic parameters and cognitive dysfunction score of the participants were measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) before the surgery, 24 h and 1 week after the surgery. RESULTS: An evaluation of hemodynamic parameters before anesthesia up to 24 h after the surgery showed no significant difference between the midazolam, dexmedetomidine, and control groups in terms of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and blood oxygen saturation (P > 0.05). In addition, there was no statistically significant difference between the midazolam and dexmedetomidine groups in the MMSE score before the surgery and 24 h and 1 week after that (P > 0.05). However, there was a significant difference between these two groups and control (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference between midazolam and dexmedetomidine in reducing postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). However, there is a significant difference between these two groups and control. Hence, either midazolam or dexmedetomidine can be prescribed to reduce POCD in cataract surgeries.},

	abstract = {This paper uses a neural network model to study the protective effect of dexmedetomidine on the anesthesia recovery period and neurocognitive function in elderly patients undergoing radical resection of colorectal cancer. Eighty-eight patients with colorectal cancer who underwent radical surgery in our hospital from January 2015 to June 2017 were randomly divided into groups: study (43 cases) and control (45 cases). The study group was treated with dexmedetomidine for anesthesia. Patients in the study group were given a slow pumping dose of 1 Î¼g/kg to prepare dexmedetomidine at a dose of 1 Î¼g/kg. The pumping time was >10 minutes, and the dose was 0.3 Î¼g after completion. The loading dose of 0.3 (kgÂ·h) was maintained intraoperatively; the control group was given the same amount of saline infusion by the same infusion method. The study found that the probability of cognitive dysfunction in the study group was significantly lower than that in the control group, and the degree of cognitive dysfunction in the study group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05). Therefore in the operation of elderly patients with colorectal cancer radical surgery, dexmedetomidine is used for anesthesia to protect postoperative cognitive function and reduce the incidence of cognitive dysfunction.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a serious complication after surgery, especially in elderly patients. The anesthesia technique is a potentially modifiable risk factor for POCD. This study assessed the effects of dexmedetomidine, propofol or midazolam sedation on POCD in elderly patients who underwent hip or knee replacement under spinal anesthesia. METHODS: The present study was a prospective randomized controlled preliminary trial. From July 2013 and December 2014, a total of 164 patients aged 65 years or older who underwent hip or knee arthroplasty at China-Japan Friendship Hospital and 41 non-surgical controls were included in this study. Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 3 sedative groups. All the patients received combined spinal-epidural anesthesia (CSEA) with midazolam, dexmedetomidine or propofol sedation. The sedative dose was adjusted to achieve light sedation (bispectral index{$[$}BIS{$]$} score between 70 and 85). All study participants and controls completed a battery of 5 neuropsychological tests before and 7 days after surgery. One year postoperatively, the patients and controls were interviewed over the telephone using the Montreal cognitive assessment 5-minute protocol. RESULTS: In all, 60 of 164 patients (36.6{\%}) were diagnosed with POCD 7 days postoperatively, POCD incidence in propofol group was significantly lower than that in dexmedetomidine and midazolam groups (18.2{\%} vs. 40.0{\%}, 51.9{\%}, Ï= 6.342 and 13.603, P = 0.012 and < 0.001). When the patients were re-tested 1 year postoperatively, the incidence of POCD was not significantly different among the 3 groups (14.0{\%}, 10.6{\%} vs. 14.9{\%}, Ï= 0.016 and 0.382, P = 0.899 and 0.536). CONCLUSION: Among dexmedetomidine, propofol and midazolam sedation in elderly patients, propofol sedation shows a significant advantage in term of short-term POCD incidence.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium was reported to be associated with increased postoperative mortality after liver resection. Therefore, it is crucial to prevent postoperative delirium in such cases. Ramelteon, an agonist of melatonin receptor has been suggested to be useful for preventing delirium. The aim of this study was to examine whether ramelteon is effective at preventing delirium after elective liver resection. METHODS: The cases of patients who underwent liver resection at Nara Medical University (Nara, Japan) between January 2014 and August 2018 were analyzed. During the period from January 2017 to August 2018, ramelteon was prospectively administered to patients who underwent liver resection {$[$}8 mg/day on the day before surgery and on postoperative days 1 to 3{$]$} (ramelteon group), whereas ramelteon was not administered during the period from January 2014 to December 2016 (control group). The perioperative outcomes of the two groups were compared. RESULTS: There were 120 patients in the ramelteon group and 186 patients in the control group. No significant intergroup differences in background factors, including age, gender, and preoperative serological laboratory data, were detected. The incidence of postoperative delirium was significantly lower in the ramelteon group (5.8{\%} vs. 15.1{\%}, P = 0.035). Multivariate analysis revealed that being aged â¥75 (P = 0.002), being male (P = 0.020), cardiovascular disease (P = 0.023), blood loss â¥1000ml (P = 0.001) and the absence of ramelteon treatment (P = 0.046) were independent risk factors for postoperative delirium. CONCLUSION: The administration of ramelteon might reduce the risk of postoperative delirium after elective liver resection.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether exogenous melatonin supplementation could ameliorate early postoperative cognitive decline (POCD) in aged patients undergoing hip arthroplasty with spinal anesthesia. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Department of Anesthesiology, Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China. PATIENTS: One hundred and thirty-nine patients with ASA I-III, older than 65yr of age (mean age: 74.5$\pm$5.5; gender: male 53 and female 86), scheduled for hip arthroplasty were included in the present study. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to receive 1mg oral melatonin or placebo daily 1h before bedtime one day before surgery and for another 5 consecutive days postoperatively. MEASUREMENTS: The subject assessment, including Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, subjective sleep quality, general well-being, postoperative fatigue, and visual analogue scale for pain were evaluated pre-operatively and at days 1, 3, 5, and 7 after surgery. MAIN RESULTS: The MMSE score in the control group decreased significantly after surgery when compared with its own preoperative value or the melatonin group at days 1, 3, and 5. However, the MMSE score in the melatonin group remained unchanged during the 7days of monitoring. In addition, significant postoperative impairments of subjective sleep quality, general well-being, and fatigue were found in the control group when compared with the melatonin group. CONCLUSION: Peroperative melatonin supplementation might improve early POCD, suggesting restoration of normal circadian function with good sleep quality may be one of the key factors in preventing or treating POCD.},

	abstract = {Delirium occurs commonly following major non-cardiac and cardiac surgery and is associated with: postoperative mortality; postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction; increased length of hospital stay; and major postoperative complications and morbidity. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of peri-operative administration of dexmedetomidine on the incidence of postoperative delirium in non-cardiac and cardiac surgical patients. In this randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trial we included 63 patients aged â¥60 years undergoing major open abdominal surgery or coronary artery bypass graft surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative delirium, as screened for with the Confusion Assessment Method. Delirium assessment was performed twice daily until postoperative day 5, at the time of discharge from hospital or until postoperative day 14. We found that dexmedetomidine was associated with a reduced incidence of postoperative delirium within the first 5 postoperative days, 43.8{\%} vs. 17.9{\%}, p = 0.038. Severity of delirium, screened with the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist, was comparable in both groups, with a mean maximum score of 1.54 vs. 1.68, p = 0.767. No patients in the dexmedetomidine group died while five (15.6{\%}) patients in the placebo group died, p = 0.029. For patients aged â¥60 years undergoing major cardiac or non-cardiac surgery, we conclude that the peri-operative administration of dexmedetomidine is associated with a lower incidence of postoperative delirium.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sevoflurane anesthesia is a high-risk factor for postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in elderly patients. Recently, some studies demonstrated that dexmedetomidine (DEX) could reduce the incidence of POCD caused by sevoflurane anesthesia. We hypothesized that DEX could reduce the incidence of POCD caused by sevoflurane anesthesia through decreasing plasma interleukin (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±concentrations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 120 patients aged 65-75 years scheduled for esophageal carcinoma resection were randomly assigned to four groups. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were used to measure patients' cognitive function the day before operation and the 1(st), 3(rd), and 7(th) postoperative days. The plasma TNF-Î±, IL-6, and S100 Î²protein concentrations were measured by ELISA 10 min before anesthesia administration and the 1(st), 3(rd), and 7(th) postoperative days. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the demographic or clinical characteristics or perioperative hemodynamic status in all groups. Compared with Group M + P, the MMSE and MoCA scores were significantly lower and the plasma TNF-Î±, IL-6, and S100 Î²protein concentrations were significantly higher in Group M + S at the 1(st), 3(rd), and 7(th) postoperative days (P < 0.05). Compared with Group M + S, the MMSE and MoCA scores were significantly higher and the plasma TNF-Î±, IL-6, and S100 Î²protein concentrations were significantly lower in Group D + S at the 1(st), 3(rd), and 7(th) postoperative days (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The POCD incidence was higher in elderly patients receiving sevoflurane anesthesia and DEX could alleviate POCD in these patients through decreasing plasma TNF-Î±and IL-6 concentrations.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: There were few clinical data dosing and timing regimen for preventing postoperative delirium. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of the timing and dose of dexmedetomidine on postoperative delirium in elderly patients after laparoscopic major non-cardiac surgery. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: A total of 354 patients >65 years of age undergoing laparoscopic major non-cardiac surgery under general anesthesia received a dexmedetomidine 1 Î¼g/kg bolus followed by 0.2-0.7 Î¼g/kg/h infusion from induction of anesthesia to the end of surgery {$[$}group D1{$]$}); a dexmedetomidine (1 Î¼g/kg bolus {$[$}group D2{$]$}); or saline (group S) 15 min before the end of surgery. MEASUREMENTS: The incidence and duration of delirium for 5 days after surgery and the cytokine (tumor necrosis factor-alpha TNFÎ±, interleukin {$[$}IL{$]$}-1 Î², IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10) and cortisol levels were measured 1 h and 24 h after surgery. MAIN RESULTS: Group D1 reduced incidence and duration of delirium and group D2 decreased its duration in patients with delirium compared to group S. IL-6 levels were significantly lower at 1 h and 24 h after surgery in group D1 than in group S, and lower at 24 h after surgery than in group D2. IL-6 levels in group D2 were significantly lower only at 1 h after surgery than in group S. However, IL-6 levels in delirious patients in group D2 were significantly lower at 1 h and 24 h after surgery than those in group S. Cortisol levels 1 h after surgery were significantly lower in groups D1 and D2 than in group S. CONCLUSIONS: The dose and timing of dexmedetomidine appeared to be important in preventing delirium. The reduced incidence and duration of delirium by dexmedetomidine was associated with reduced levels of IL-6 24 h after surgery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) commonly occurs after cardiac surgery. Ketamine exerts neuroprotective effects after cerebral ischemia by anti-excitotoxic and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. We hypothesized that ketamine attenuates POCD in patients undergoing cardiac surgery concomitant with an anti-inflammatory effect. METHODS: Patients randomly received placebo (0.9{\%} saline; n=26) or an i.v. bolus of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg; n=26) during anesthetic induction. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane and fentanyl. A nonsurgical group (n=26) was also included as control. Recent verbal and nonverbal memory and executive functions were assessed before and 1 week after surgery or a 1-week waiting period for the nonsurgical controls. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations were determined before surgery and on the first post-operative day. RESULTS: Baseline neurocognitive and depression scores were similar in the placebo, ketamine, and nonsurgical control groups. Cognitive performance after surgery decreased by at least 2 SDs (z-score of 1.96) in 21 patients in the placebo group and only in seven patients in the ketamine group compared with the nonsurgical controls (P<0.001, Fisher's exact test). Cognitive performance was also significantly different between the placebo- and the ketamine-treated groups based on all z-scores (P<0.001, Mann-Whitney U-test). Pre-operative CRP concentrations were similar (P<0.33, Mann-Whitney U-test) in the placebo- and ketamine-treated groups. The post-operative CRP concentration was significantly (P<0.01, Mann-Whitney U-test) lower in the ketamine-treated than in the placebo-treated group. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine attenuates POCD 1 week after cardiac surgery and this effect may be related to the anti-inflammatory action of the drug.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delirium, which is one of the most disturbing postoperative complications in elderly patients, shows high morbidity in patients undergoing lung cancer surgery. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is considered a potential prophylactic agent for preventing patients' delirium after lung cancer surgery. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Medical records of lung cancer patients over 65 years old with radical pulmonary resection at Henan Provincial People's Hospital from January 2015 to December 2017, China, were evaluated. Patients, care-providers, and investigators were all blinded to group assignment. DEX was administered in the preoperative and intraoperative periods. The incidence of delirium was calculated based on the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC). Scores of â¥4 and 1-3 points represent the diagnoses of delirium and a pre-delirious state, respectively. RESULTS: During postoperative day 1 (POD 1) to POD 7, delirium occurs in both groups. During postoperative POD 1 to POD 7, the incidence of delirium is lower in the DEX group than that in the control group. Furthermore, there are more mild delirium patients but fewer moderate and severe delirium patients in the DEX group compared with the control group. Finally, patients in the DEX group have a shorter duration of delirium, lower numeric pain rating scale during movement and better sleep quality. CONCLUSION: Preoperative and intraoperative application of DEX can reduce the incidence and intensity of delirium after pulmonary resection in elderly patients with lung cancer.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delirium is a frequent complication after cardiac surgery and its occurrence is associated with poor outcomes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of perioperative dexmedetomidine administration on the incidence of delirium in elderly patients after cardiac surgery. METHODS: This randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled trial was conducted in two tertiary hospitals in Beijing between December 1, 2014 and July 19, 2015. Eligible patients were randomized into two groups. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) was administered during anesthesia and early postoperative period for patients in the DEX group, whereas normal saline was administered in the same rate for the same duration for patients in the control (CTRL) group. The primary endpoint was the incidence of delirium during the first five days after surgery. Secondary endpoints included the cognitive function assessed on postoperative days 6 and 30, the overall incidence of non-delirium complications within 30 days after surgery, and the all-cause 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-five patients were enrolled and randomized. Dexmedetomidine did not decrease the incidence of delirium (4.9{\%} {$[$}7/142{$]$} in the DEX group vs 7.7{\%} {$[$}11/143{$]$} in the CTRL group; OR 0.62, 95{\%} CI 0.23 to 1.65, p = 0.341). Secondary endpoints were similar between the two groups; however, the incidence of pulmonary complications was slightly decreased (OR 0.51, 95{\%} CI 0.26 to 1.00, p = 0.050) and the percentage of early extubation was significantly increased (OR 3.32, 95{\%} CI 1.36 to 8.08, p = 0.008) in the DEX group. Dexmedetomidine decreased the required treatment for intraoperative tachycardia (21.1{\%} {$[$}30/142{$]$} in the DEX group vs 33.6{\%} {$[$}48/143{$]$} in the CTRL group, p = 0.019), but increased the required treatment for postoperative hypotension (84.5{\%} {$[$}120/142{$]$} in the DEX group vs 69.9{\%} {$[$}100/143{$]$} in the CTRL group, p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Dexmedetomidine administered during anesthesia and early postoperative period did not decrease the incidence of postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. However, considering the low delirium incidence, the trial might have been underpowered. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02267538.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a serious complication in elderly patients undergoing cardiac surgery. This study was aimed at investigating the effect of perioperative administration of dexmedetomidine for general anesthesia maintenance on occurrence and duration of POD in elderly patients after cardiac surgery. METHODS: One hundred and sixty-four patients were enrolled after cardiac surgery between June 2009 and December 2016. Patients were assigned by a computer-generated randomization sequence in a 1:1 ratio to receive dexmedetomidine general anesthesia maintenance or propofol general anesthesia maintenance. POD was assessed every day with confusion assessment method for intensive care units (ICU) during the first 5 postoperative days. RESULTS: There was no significance in incidence of POD between the dexmedetomidine group and the propofol group (P=0.0758). In patients treated with dexmedetomidine, the median onset time of delirium was delayed (second day vs first day) and the duration of delirium reduced (2 days vs 3 days) when compared with propofol-treated patients. The dexmedetomidine-treated patients also displayed a lower VAS score and less opiate analgesic consumption. No difference was observed in respect to other postoperative outcomes. CONCLUSION: For elderly patients, perioperative administration of dexmedetomidine reduced incidence, delayed onset and shortened duration of POD after cardiac surgery.},
