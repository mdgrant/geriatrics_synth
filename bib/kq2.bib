	abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to evaluate whether preoperative immunonutrition can shorten length of stay and improve postoperative outcomes in frail patients who are candidates for major oncologic colorectal surgery. METHODS: A single center retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database of frail patients, who underwent surgery with curative intent for colorectal cancer between January 2014 and December 2017, was performed. From March 2016, frail oncological patients undergoing major surgery were recommended to receive preoperative immunonutrition; their postoperative outcomes were compared to those of patients not treated with any preoperative nutritional support. Propensity score matching in a 1:1 ratio was used to balance patient characteristics. RESULTS: Overall, 175 patients were included in the study. Of 74 patients receiving immunonutrition, 65 were matched with the group not treated with immunonutrition (n = 101). Baseline characteristics were comparable after matching. Although differences in postoperative length of stay were nonsignificant (p = 0.38), patients who received immunonutrition showed a shorter gastrointestinal (GI) recovery time (3.00 {$[$}2.00-4.00{$]$} versus 4.00 {$[$}2.00-5.00{$]$}, p = 0.04), a lower rate of situs site infections complications (0.31 {$[$}0.10, 0.94{$]$}, p = 0.04) and less need of antibiotic treatment (0.19 {$[$}0.06, 0.64{$]$}, p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Preoperative immunonutrition was found to reduce both postoperative situs site infections and need of antibiotic treatment during the postoperative course. This study encourages the use of preoperative immune-enhancing nutrition as a part of multimodal prehabilitation programs in the management of frail colorectal cancer patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: An immune-enhancing diet has been used to alter eicosanoid synthesis, cytokine production, and immune function in an attempt to limit the undesired immune reactions after injury from surgery. This prospective randomized study was designed to investigate the effect of preoperative immunonutrition on operative complications, and the participation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) on T-cell differentiation in patients undergoing a severely stressful surgery. METHODS: The enrolled patients who were scheduled to undergo pancreatoduodenectomy were randomized into two groups. Patients in the immunonutrition group (n = 25) received oral supplementation containing arginine, omega-3 fatty acids, and RNA for 5 days before the procedure in addition to a 50{\%} reduction in the amount of regular food. Patients in the control group (n = 25) received no artificial nutrition and were allowed to consume regular food before surgery. All patients received early postoperative enteral infusion of a standard formula intended to provide 25 kcal/kg/day. The primary endpoint was the rate of infectious complications; the secondary endpoint was immune responses. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01256034). RESULTS: Infectious complication rate and severity of complications (Clavien-Dindo classification) were lesser in the immunonutrition group than in the control group. mRNA expression levels of T-bet were greater in the immunonutrition group than in the control group (P < .05). Serum eicosapentaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid/arachidonic acid ratios were greater in the immunonutrition group than in the control group (P < .05). The levels of plasma PGE2 were lesser in the immunonutrition group than in the control group (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Preoperative immunonutrition modulates PGE2 production and T-cell differentiation and may protect against the aggravation of operative complications in patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several studies have demonstrated that prehabilitation helps reduce the incidence of postoperative complications. In this study, we investigated the safety and efficacy of enhanced prehabilitation (EP) in the hospital for patients with esophageal cancer. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data of 48 consecutive patients who underwent radical esophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction between September 2015 and June 2019. EP program had been introduced in August 2017. In the EP group, patients received the EP program during hospitalization 7 days before surgery in addition to conventional perioperative rehabilitation. The EP program consisted of aerobic exercise and muscle strength training in the morning and afternoon. Operative outcomes were compared between patients who received EP (EP group; 23 patients) and patients who did not receive EP (control group; 25 patients). RESULTS: The preoperative (EP group vs. control group, 492.9 +/- 79.7 vs. 418.9 +/- 71.8 m, p < 0.001) and postoperative (EP group vs. control group, 431.5 +/- 80 vs. 378 +/- 68.7 m, p < 0.001) 6-min walk distance was significantly higher in the EP group than in the control group. The respiratory complications rate was significantly lower in the EP group (4.3{\%}) than in the control group (36{\%}) (p = 0.007). The incidence of atelectasis was particularly significantly lower in the EP group (0{\%}) than in the control group (24{\%}) (p = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: EP was performed safely for patients before esophagectomy. EP improved the exercise tolerance of the patients before esophagectomy and might be useful in preventing respiratory complications.},

@article{16323,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant therapy reduces fitness, muscle mass, and quality of life (QOL). For patients undergoing chemotherapy and surgery for esophagogastric cancer, maintenance of fitness is paramount. This study investigated the effect of exercise and psychological prehabilitation on anaerobic threshold (AT) at cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). Secondary endpoints included peak oxygen uptake (peak VO2), skeletal muscle mass, QOL, and neoadjuvant therapy completion. METHODS: This parallel-arm randomized controlled trial assigned patients with locally advanced esophagogastric cancer to receive prehabilitation or usual care. The 15-week program comprised twice-weekly supervised exercises, thrice-weekly home exercises, and psychological coaching. CPET was performed at baseline, 2 weeks after neoadjuvant therapy, and 1 week preoperatively. Skeletal muscle cross-sectional area at L3 was analyzed on staging and restaging computed tomography. QOL questionnaires were completed at baseline, mid-neoadjuvant therapy, at restaging laparoscopy, and postoperatively at 2 weeks, 6 weeks and 6 months. RESULTS: Fifty-four participants were randomized (prehabilitation group, n = 26; control group, n = 28). No difference in AT between groups was observed post-neoadjuvant therapy. Prehabilitation resulted in an attenuated peak VO2 decline {\{}-0.4 {$[$}95{\%} confidence interval (CI) -0.8 to 0.1{$]$} vs. -2.5 {$[$}95{\%} CI -2.8 to -2.2{$]$} mL/kg/min; p = 0.022{\}}, less muscle loss {$[$}-11.6 (95{\%} CI -14.2 to -9.0) vs. -15.6 (95{\%} CI -18.7 to -15.4) cm(2)/m(2); p = 0.049{$]$}, and improved QOL. More prehabilitation patients completed neoadjuvant therapy at full dose {$[$}prehabilitation group, 18 (75{\%}) vs. control group, 13 (46{\%}); p = 0.036{$]$}. No adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated some retention of cardiopulmonary fitness (peak VO2), muscle, and QOL in prehabilitation subjects. Further large-scale trials will help determine whether these promising findings translate into improved clinical and oncological outcomes. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02950324.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis is a prevalent condition in older adults that causes many patients to require a hip or knee replacement. Reducing patients' sedentariness prior to surgery may improve physical function and post-operative outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic randomised-controlled feasibility study with 2:1 allocation into intervention or usual care groups. The intervention, based on Self-Determination Theory, involved techniques to reduce sedentary behaviour, including motivational interviewing, setting of behavioural goals, and more. The primary outcome was feasibility, assessed using mixed methods. We included exploratory measures to inform a future definitive trial, such as ActivPal3 accelerometry to measure movement, the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), Basic Psychological Needs, and cardiometabolic biomarkers. Assessments were at baseline, 1-week pre-surgery, and 6-week post-surgery. RESULTS: We recruited 35 participants aged ≥60 years approximately 8 weeks before hip or knee arthroplasty. Participant uptake rate was 14.2{\%}, and retention rate 85.7{\%}. Participants were very satisfied with the study which was found to be feasible with some modifications. Exploratory within-group comparisons found that the intervention has potential to improve SPPB by 0.71 points from baseline to pre-surgery, a clinically significant increase, and reduce sedentary time by up to 66 min d(-1). CONCLUSION: In this older surgical population, it is feasible to use behavioural techniques to displace sedentary time to activity and to conduct a trial spanning the period of surgical intervention. This may improve physical function and surgical outcomes. The INTEREST intervention is now ready for evaluation in a full-scale randomised-controlled trial. REGISTRATION: This trial was registered on Clinicaltrials.gov on 13/11/2018. ID: NCT03740412.},

Eligible candidates who accepted to participate were randomized to the control (standard care) or intervention (standard care + prehabilitation) group. All patients with pancreatic or periampullary tumors who were candidates for pancreaticoduodenectomy were included. Patients who received neoadjuvant treatment were excluded. Prehabilitation covered three actions: a) nutritional support; b) control of diabetes and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency; and c) physical and respiratory training. The main study outcome was the proportion of patients who suffered postoperative complications. Secondary outcomes included the occurrence of specific complications (pancreatic leak and delayed gastric emptying) and hospital stay. RESULTS: forty patients were included in the analysis. Twenty-two patients were randomized to the control arm and 18, to the intervention group. No statistically significant differences were observed in terms of overall and major complications between the prehabilitation and standard care groups. Pancreatic leak was not statistically different between the groups (11{\%} vs 27{\%}, p = 0.204). However, DGE was significantly lower in the prehabilitation group (5.6{\%} vs 40.9{\%} in the standard care group, p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: prehabilitation did not reduce postoperative complications following pancreaticoduodenectomy. However, a reduction in DGE was observed. Further studies are needed to validate the role and the timing of prehabilitation in high-risk patients.},

	abstract = {Background: The concept of preparing the body before a stressful event, such as surgery, has been termed ``prehabilitation''(preoperative physiotherapy and exercise programs). Prehabilitation programs for people awaiting total knee arthroplasty (TKA) have positive effects on patients health status and may also lead to better postoperative outcomes. Aim: The purpose of this study was to examine effect of a prehabilitation program on knee pain, functional ability among patients with knee osteoarthritis after TKA surgery. Study Design: A Prospective Controlled Study. Patients and Methods: Subjects enrolled in this prospective controlled study who referred to our Orthopedics and Traumatology outpatient clinic between 2014 April--2015 May, had severe OA with pain not responsive to conservative treatment and scheduled for unilateral TKA. Subjects were assigned to a control or prehabilitation group. Patients of prehabilitation group were recruited from the orthopaedic waiting lists for primary unilateral TKA. Partipicants in the prehabilitation group were prescribed a training program that consisted of education and home-based exercise 12 weeks before the operation. After the TKA, all subjects partipicated in the same postoperative rehabilitation protocol. Evaluations were made before the surgery, with follow-up assessments at 3 and 6 months after surgery. Knee pain was assessed by the use of a 10-cm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and function assesed by Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) scale. Results: A statistically significant improvement was observed in the values of VAS and all subsclaes of KOOS in both groups at third and sixth month compared to baseline. The intergroup comparison of the improvement (pre-post scores at sixth month) did not show any statistically significant diffeferences in VAS and KOOS scores. Conclusion: Our results show that prehabilitation before TKA is not superior to surgical treatment alone but about 20{\%} of the patients changed their operation decision. So it is important to be able to postpone this process especially in the early period.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prehabilitation may reduce postoperative complications, but sustainability of its health benefits and impact on costs needs further evaluation. Our aim was to assess the midterm clinical impact and costs from a hospital perspective of an endurance-exercise-training-based prehabilitation programme in high-risk patients undergoing major digestive surgery. METHODS: A cost-consequence analysis was performed using secondary data from a randomised, blinded clinical trial. The main outcomes assessed were (i) 30-day hospital readmissions, (ii) endurance time (ET) during an exercise testing, and (iii) physical activity by the Yale Physical Activity Survey (YPAS). Healthcare use for the cost analysis included costs of the prehabilitation programme, hospitalisation, and 30-day emergency room visits and hospital readmissions. RESULTS: We included 125 patients in an intention-to-treat analysis. Prehabilitation showed a protective effect for 30-day hospital readmissions (relative risk: 6.4; 95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$}: 1.4-30.0). Prehabilitation-induced enhancement of ET and YPAS remained statistically significant between groups at the end of the 3 and 6 month follow-up periods, respectively (ΔET 205 {$[$}151{$]$} s; P=0.048) (ΔYPAS 7 {$[$}2{$]$}; P=0.016). The mean cost of the programme was €389 per patient and did not increment the total costs of the surgical process (€812; CI: 95{\%} -878 - 2642; P=0.365). CONCLUSIONS: Prehabilitation may result in health value generation. Moreover, it appears to be a protective intervention for 30-day hospital readmissions, and its effects on aerobic capacity and physical activity may show sustainability at midterm.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of personalized prehabilitation on postoperative complications in high-risk patients undergoing elective major abdominal surgery. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Prehabilitation, including endurance exercise training and promotion of physical activity, in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery has been postulated as an effective preventive intervention to reduce postoperative complications. However, the existing studies provide controversial results and show a clear bias toward low-risk patients. METHODS: This was a randomized blinded controlled trial. Eligible candidates accepting to participate were blindly randomized (1:1 ratio) to control (standard care) or intervention (standard care + prehabilitation) groups. Inclusion criteria were: i) age >70 years; and/or, ii) American Society of Anesthesiologists score III/IV. Prehabilitation covered 3 actions: i) motivational interview; ii) high-intensity endurance training; and promotion of physical activity. The main study outcome was the proportion of patients suffering postoperative complications. Secondary outcomes included the endurance time (ET) during cycle-ergometer exercise. RESULTS: We randomized 71 patients to the control arm and 73 to intervention. After excluding 19 patients because of changes in the surgical plan, 63 controls and 62 intervention patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The intervention group enhanced aerobic capacity {$[$}ΔET 135 (218) {\%}; P < 0.001), reduced the number of patients with postoperative complications by 51{\%} (relative risk 0.5; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.3-0.8; P = 0.001) and the rate of complications {$[$}1.4 (1.6) and 0.5 (1.0) (P =  0.001){$]$} as compared with controls. CONCLUSION: Prehabilitation enhanced postoperative clinical outcomes in high-risk candidates for elective major abdominal surgery, which can be explained by the increased aerobic capacity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Invasive procedures such as surgery cause immunosuppression, leading to increased risk of complications, infections and extended hospital stay. Emerging research around immune-enhancing nutrition supplements and their ability to reduce postoperative complications and reduce treatment costs is promising. This randomised controlled trial aims to examine the effect of preoperative immunonutrition supplementation on length of hospital stay (LOS), complications and treatment costs in both well-nourished and malnourished gastrointestinal surgery patients. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Ninety-five patients undergoing elective upper and lower gastrointestinal surgery were recruited. The treatment group (n=46) received a commercial immuno-enhancing supplement 5 days preoperatively. The control group (n=49) received no supplements. The primary outcome measure was LOS, and secondary outcome measures included complications and cost. RESULTS: A nonsignificant trend towards a shorter LOS within the treatment group was observed (7.1 +/- 4.1 compared with 8.8 +/- 6.5 days; P=0.11). For malnourished patients, this trend was greater with hospital stay reduced by 4 days (8.3 +/- 3.5 vs 12.3 +/- 9.5 days; P=0.21). Complications and unplanned intensive care admission rates were very low in both the groups. The average admission cost was reduced by AUD1576 in the treatment group compared with the control group (P=0.37). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative immunonutrition therapy in gastrointestinal surgery has the potential to reduce the LOS and cost, with greater treatment benefit seen in malnourished patients; however, there is a need for additional research with greater patient numbers.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of a preoperative exercise/education program on functional recovery, health related quality of life (HRQOL), health service utilization, and costs following primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA). METHODS: One hundred thirty-one subjects were randomized to either the control (n = 66) or treatment (n = 65) group 6 weeks before TKA surgery. Patients in the treatment group underwent a 4-week exercise/education program before surgery. All subjects were assessed 6 weeks preoperatively (before the exercise/education intervention), immediately preoperatively (after the exercise/education intervention), and 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery utilizing the Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Index, the SF-36, and knee range of motion (ROM) and strength measures. Data on length of stay, numbers of community rehabilitation or homecare visits following discharge from the surgical hospital, and the costs associated with these services were also collected. RESULTS: Subjects were similar in demographic characteristics and all measurements at the baseline assessment. No differences were seen in knee measurements (ROM and strength), pain, function, or HRQOL between the 2 groups following the intervention program or at any postoperative measurement point. Patients in the treatment group used fewer postoperative rehabilitation services and stayed for a shorter time in hospital than the control group, but these differences did not attain statistical significance. CONCLUSION: The exercise/education intervention did not alter functional recovery or HRQOL following TKA. Health service utilization was less in the treatment group, but our study was underpowered to attain statistical significance for these measures.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of a 3-week community-based exercise program on 30-day postoperative complications in high-risk patients scheduled for elective colorectal resection for (pre)malignancy. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Patients with a low preoperative aerobic fitness undergoing colorectal surgery have an increased risk of postoperative complications. It remains, however, to be demonstrated whether prehabilitation in these patients reduces postoperative complications. METHODS: This 2-center, prospective, single-blinded randomized clinical trial was carried out in 2 large teaching hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients (>/=60 years) with colorectal (pre)malignancy scheduled for elective colorectal resection and with a score </=7 metabolic equivalents on the veterans-specific activity questionnaire were randomly assigned to the prehabilitation group or the usual care group by using block-stratified randomization. An oxygen uptake at the ventilatory anaerobic threshold <11 mL/kg/min at the baseline cardiopulmonary exercise test was the final inclusion criterion. Inclusion was based on a power analysis. Patients in the prehabilitation group participated in a personalized 3-week (3 sessions per week, nine sessions in total) supervised exercise program given in community physical therapy practices before colorectal resection. Patients in the reference group received usual care. The primary outcome was the number of patients with one or more complications within 30 days of surgery, graded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: Between February 2014 and December 2018, 57 patients {$[$}30 males and 27 females; mean age 73.6 years (standard deviation 6.1), range 61-88 years{$]$} were randomized to either prehabilitation (n = 28) or usual care (n = 29). The rate of postoperative complications was lower in the prehabilitation group (n = 12, 42.9{\%}) than in the usual care group (n = 21, 72.4{\%}, relative risk 0.59, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.37-0.96, P = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: Exercise prehabilitation reduced postoperative complications in high-risk patients scheduled to undergo elective colon resection for (pre)malignancy. Prehabilitation should be considered as usual care in high-risk patients scheduled for elective colon, and probably also rectal, surgery.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of preoperative balance training on the early postoperative balance and functional outcomes after total knee replacement surgery and to test whether an outpatient intervention may be as effective as a domiciliary intervention. DESIGN: This is a three-arm randomized controlled trial. SETTING: University hospital. SUBJECTS: Eighty-six individuals were recruited. Seventy-seven were analysed, aged 72.1 (SD 7.6) years, of which 68{\%} were women. OUTCOME MEASURES: Overall state of balance, as measured with the Berg Balance Scale, and patient-perceived functionality, as measured with the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Function in Activities in Daily Living (KOOS-ADL) questionnaire, were the primary outcomes. Secondary assessments targeted knee function, balance and mobility, quality of life, and self-reported outcomes. The primary end-point was six weeks after surgery. INTERVENTION: The hospital group implemented a four-week preoperative outpatient balance-oriented intervention. The home group implemented similar training, but this was domiciliary. The control group was instructed to keep performing their normal activities. RESULTS: Home and hospital groups presented a moderate effect against the control group (d(hospital-control) = 0.54; d(home-control) = 0.63), both being similarly effective in improving the overall state of balance at six weeks after surgery (P = 0.013). KOOS-ADL scores showed no between-group differences and a small effect size (d < 0.5; P = 0.937). Secondary assessments suggested non-significant between-group differences. CONCLUSION: Preoperative balance training, conducted either as domiciliary or as an outpatient, is an effective approach to enhance early postoperative balance outcome but not the perceived functionality of individuals undergoing total knee replacement.},

	abstract = {Background: Preoperative education and breathing exercise training by a physiotherapist minimises pulmonary complications after abdominal surgery. Effects on specific clinical outcomes such as antibiotic prescriptions, chest imaging, sputum cultures, oxygen requirements, and diagnostic coding are unknown. Methods: This post hoc analysis of prospectively collected data within a double-blinded, multicentre, randomised controlled trial involving 432 participants having major abdominal surgery explored effects of preoperative education and breathing exercise training with a physiotherapist on postoperative antibiotic prescriptions, hypoxemia, sputum cultures, chest imaging, auscultation, leukocytosis, pyrexia, oxygen therapy, and diagnostic coding, compared to a control group who received a booklet alone. All participants received standardised postoperative early ambulation. Outcomes were assessed daily for 14 postoperative days. Analyses were intention-to-treat using adjusted generalised multivariate linear regression. Results: Preoperative physiotherapy was associated with fewer antibiotic prescriptions specific for a respiratory infection (RR 0.52; 95{\%} CI 0.31 to 0.85, p = 0.01), less purulent sputum on the third and fourth postoperative days (RR 0.50; 95{\%} CI 0.34 to 0.73, p = 0.01), fewer positive sputum cultures from the third to fifth postoperative day (RR 0.17; 95{\%} CI 0.04 to 0.77, p = 0.01), and less oxygen therapy requirements (RR 0.49; 95{\%} CI 0.31 to 0.78, p = 0.002). Treatment effects were specific to respiratory clinical coding domains. Conclusions: Preoperative physiotherapy prevents postoperative pulmonary complications and is associated with the minimisation of signs and symptoms of pulmonary collapse/consolidation and airway infection and specifically results in reduced oxygen therapy requirements and antibiotic prescriptions.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prehabilitation has been previously shown to be more effective in enhancing postoperative functional capacity than rehabilitation alone. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a weekly supervised exercise session could provide further benefit to our current prehabilition program, when comparing to standard post-surgical rehabilitation. METHODS: A parallel-arm single-blind randomized control trial was conducted in patients scheduled for non-metastatic colorectal cancer resection. Patients were assigned to either a once weekly supervised prehabilitation (PREHAB+, n = 41) or standard rehabilitation (REHAB, n = 39) program. Both multimodal programs were home-based program and consisted of moderate intensity aerobic and resistance exercise, nutrition counseling with daily whey protein supplementation and anxiety-reduction strategies. Perioperative care was standardized for both groups as per enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS({\textregistered})) guidelines. Functional exercise capacity, as determined by the 6-minute walk test distance (6MWD), was the primary outcome. Exercise quantity, intensity and energy expenditure was determined by the CHAMPS questionnaire. RESULTS: Both groups were comparable for baseline walking capacity (PREHAB+: 448 m {$[$}IQR 375-525{$]$} vs. REHAB: 461 m {$[$}419-556{$]$}, p=.775) and included a similar proportion of patients who improved walking capacity (>20 m) during the preoperative period (PREHAB+: 54{\%} vs. REHAB: 38{\%}, p = .222). After surgery, changes in 6MWD were also similar in both groups. In PREHAB+, however, there was a significant association between physical activity energy expenditure and 6MWD (p < .01). Previously inactive patients were more likely to improve functional capacity due to PREHAB+ (OR 7.07 {$[$}95{\%} CI 1.10-45.51{$]$}). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of a weekly supervised exercise session to our current prehabilitation program did not further enhance postoperative walking capacity when compared to standard REHAB care. Sedentary patients, however, seemed more likely to benefit from PREHAB+. An association was found between energy spent in physical activity and 6MWD. This information is important to consider when designing cost-effective prehabilitation programs.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to develop a multistranded pragmatic rehabilitation programme for operable lung cancer patients, that looks into feasibility, process indicators, outcome measures, local adaptability, compliance and potential cost benefit. METHODS: An outpatient-based complex intervention, rehabilitation for operated lung cancer (ROC) programme, was developed to optimize physical status, prepare for the inpatient journey and support through recovery after surgery. It includes exercise classes, smoking cessation, dietary advice and patient education and was tested in an enriched cohort study within a regional thoracic unit over 18 months. RESULTS: A multistranded pragmatic rehabilitation programme pre- and post-surgery is feasible. Fifty-eight patients received the intervention and 305 received standard care. Both groups were matched for age, lung function comorbidity and type of surgery. Patients in the intervention group attended exercise classes twice a week until surgery, which was not delayed. Patients attended four sessions presurgery (range 1-15), resulting in an improvement of 20 m (range -73-195, P = 0.001) in a 6-min walk test and 0.66 l in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (range -1.85 from 1.11, P = 0.009) from baseline to presurgery. Fifty-four percentage of smokers in the intervention group stopped smoking. Sixteen percentage of patients were identified as being at risk of malnourishment and received nutritional intervention. There was a trend in patients in the intervention group towards experiencing fewer postoperative pulmonary complications than those in the non-intervention group (9 vs 16{\%}, respectively, P = 0.21) and fewer readmissions to hospital because of complications (5 vs 14{\%} respectively, P = 0.12). CONCLUSION: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease-type pulmonary rehabilitation before and after lung cancer surgery is viable, and preliminary results suggest improvement in physical measures. A multicentre, randomized controlled trial is warranted to confirm clinical efficacy. ISRCTN REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN00061628.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Promoting quality of life (QoL) is a key priority in cancer care. We investigated the hypothesis that, in comparison to usual care, exercise post-neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy/prior to surgical resection will reduce pain, fatigue, and insomnia, and will improve physical and mental health perceptions in patients with locally advanced stage rectal cancer. METHODS: In this non-randomized controlled pilot trial, patients in the supervised exercise group (EG; M (age) = 64 years; 64{\%} male) and in the control group (CG; M (age) = 72 years; 69{\%} male) completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer core Quality of Life questionnaire and the RAND 36-Item Health Survey three times: pre-neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (Time 1; n (EC) = 24; n (CG) = 11), post-neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy/pre-exercise intervention (Time 2; n (EC) = 23; n (CG) = 10), and post-exercise intervention (Time 3; n (EC) = 22; n (CG) = 10). The 6-week exercise intervention was delivered in hospital and comprised of interval aerobic training. Patients trained in pairs three times per week for 30 to 40 min. Data were analyzed by Mann-Whitney tests and by Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank tests. RESULTS: No significant between-group differences in changes were found for any of the outcomes. In both groups, fatigue levels decreased and physical health perceptions increased from pre- to post-exercise intervention. Pain levels also decreased from pre- to post-exercise intervention, albeit not significantly. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study can be used to guide a more definitive trial as they provide preliminary evidence regarding the potential effects of pre-operative exercise on self-reported pain, fatigue, insomnia, and health perceptions in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pre-operative weight loss has been consistently associated with increased post-operative morbidity. The study aims to determine if pre-operative oral nutritional supplements (ONSs) with dietary advice reduce post-operative complications. METHODS: Single-blinded randomized controlled trial. People with colorectal cancer scheduled for surgery with pre-operative weight loss >1 kg/3-6 months were randomized by using stratified blocks (1:1 ratio) in six hospitals (1 November 2013-28 February 2015). Intervention group was given 250 mL/day ONS (10.1 KJ and 0.096 g protein per mL) and dietary advice. Control group received dietary advice alone. Oral nutritional supplements were administered from diagnosis to the day preceding surgery. Research team was masked to group allocation. Primary outcome was patients with one or more surgical site infection (SSI) or chest infection; secondary outcomes included percentage weight loss, total complications, and body composition measurements. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed with both unadjusted and adjusted analyses. A sample size of 88 was required. RESULTS: Of 101 participants, (55 ONS, 46 controls) 97 had surgery. In intention-to-treat analysis, there were 21/45 (47{\%}) patients with an infection-either an SSI or chest infection in the control group vs. 17/55 (30{\%}) in the ONS group. The odds ratio of a patient incurring either an SSI or chest infection was 0.532 (P = 0.135 confidence interval 0.232 to 1.218) in the unadjusted analysis and when adjusted for random differences at baseline (age, gender, percentage weight loss, and cancer staging) was 0.341 (P = 0.031, confidence interval 0.128 to 0.909). Pre-operative percentage weight loss at the first time point after randomization was 4.1{\%} {$[$}interquartile range (IQR) 1.7-7.0{$]$} in ONS group vs. 6.7{\%} (IQR 2.6-10.8) in controls (Mann-Whitney U P = 0.021) and post-operatively was 7.4{\%} (IQR 4.3-10.0) in ONS group vs. 10.2{\%} (IQR 5.1-18.5) in controls (P = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with dietary advice alone, ONS resulted in patients having fewer infections and less weight loss following surgery for colorectal cancer. We have demonstrated that pre-operative oral nutritional supplementation can improve clinical outcome in weight losing patients with colorectal cancer.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Perioperative oral supplementation has been shown to reduce post-operative complications. However, the use of preoperative standard oral supplements in a cohort of colorectal cancer patients has not been evaluated. The present study examined whether preoperative supplements are beneficial in this group. METHODS: In a randomised controlled trial, patients were assigned to receive 400 mL of oral supplement and dietary advice or dietary advice alone. Primary outcome was the number of post-operative complications. One hundred and twenty-five patients were recruited (59 randomised to the intervention group and 66 to the control group) and nine were excluded. RESULTS: In the intervention group, 24 (44{\%}) patients had a complication compared to 26 (42{\%}) in the control group (P = 0.780). In the intervention and control groups, there were eight (15{\%}) and 16 (25{\%}) surgical site infections, respectively (P = 0.140) and seven (13{\%}) and 11 (17{\%}) chest infections, respectively (P = 0.470). Subgroup analysis for hypothesis generation included 83 (71{\%}) weight-losing patients, where there was a significant reduction in surgical site infections using the Buzby definition (P = 0.034), although this was not the case for the Centre for Disease Control definition (P = 0.052). CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence that preoperative supplements were beneficial in reducing the number of complications, although there may be some benefit for surgical site infections in selected weight-losing preoperative patients.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The benefits of preoperative training programmes compared with alternative treatment are unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a high-intensity preoperative resistance training programme in patients waiting for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). METHODS: Forty-four subjects (7 men, 37 women) scheduled for unilateral TKA for osteoarthritis (OA) during 2014 participated in this randomized controlled trial. Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), the Physical Functioning Scale of the Short Form-36 questionnaire (SF-36), a 10-cm visual analogue scale (VAS), isometric knee flexion, isometric knee extension, isometric hip abduction, active knee range of motion and functional tasks (Timed Up and Go test and Stair ascent-descent test) were assessed at 8 weeks before surgery (T1), after 8 weeks of training (T2), 1 month after TKA (T3) and finally 3 months after TKA (T4). The intervention group completed an 8-week training programme 3 days per week prior to surgery. RESULTS: Isometric knee flexion, isometric hip abduction, VAS, WOMAC, ROM extension and flexion and all the functional assessments were greater for the intervention group at T2, T3 and T4, whereas isometric knee extension was greater for this group at T2 and T4 compared with control. CONCLUSION: The present study supports the use of preoperative training in end-stage OA patients to improve early postoperative outcomes. High-intensity strength training during the preoperative period reduces pain and improves lower limb muscle strength, ROM and functional task performance before surgery, resulting in a reduced length of stay at the hospital and a faster physical and functional recovery after TKA. The present training programme can be used by specialists to speed up recovery after TKA. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: I.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Research supports use of prehabilitation to optimize physical status before and after colorectal cancer resection, but its effect on postoperative complications remains unclear. Frail patients are a target for prehabilitation interventions owing to increased risk for poor postoperative outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To assess the extent to which a prehabilitation program affects 30-day postoperative complications in frail patients undergoing colorectal cancer resection compared with postoperative rehabilitation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This single-blind, parallel-arm, superiority randomized clinical trial recruited patients undergoing colorectal cancer resection from September 7, 2015, through June 19, 2019. Patients were followed up for 4 weeks before surgery and 4 weeks after surgery at 2 university-affiliated tertiary hospitals. A total of 418 patients 65 years or older were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 298 patients were excluded (not frail {$[$}n = 290{$]$}, unable to exercise {$[$}n = 3{$]$}, and planned neoadjuvant treatment {$[$}n = 5{$]$}), and 120 frail patients (Fried Frailty Index,≥2) were randomized. Ten patients were excluded after randomization because they refused surgery (n = 3), died before surgery (n = 3), had no cancer (n = 1), had surgery without bowel resection (n = 1), or were switched to palliative care (n = 2). Hence, 110 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis (55 in the prehabilitation {$[$}Prehab{$]$} and 55 in the rehabilitation {$[$}Rehab{$]$} groups). Data were analyzed from July 25 through August 21, 2019. INTERVENTIONS: Multimodal program involving exercise, nutritional, and psychological interventions initiated before (Prehab group) or after (Rehab group) surgery. All patients were treated within a standardized enhanced recovery pathway. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome included the Comprehensive Complications Index measured at 30 days after surgery. Secondary outcomes were 30-day overall and severe complications, primary and total length of hospital stay, 30-day emergency department visits and hospital readmissions, recovery of walking capacity, and patient-reported outcome measures. RESULTS: Of 110 patients randomized, mean (SD) age was 78 (7) years; 52 (47.3{\%}) were men and 58 (52.7{\%}) were women; 31 (28.2{\%}) had rectal cancer; and 87 (79.1{\%}) underwent minimally invasive surgery. There was no between-group difference in the primary outcome measure, 30-day Comprehensive Complications Index (adjusted mean difference, -3.2; 95{\%} CI, -11.8 to 5.3; P = .45). Secondary outcome measures were also not different between groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In frail patients undergoing colorectal cancer resection (predominantly minimally invasive) within an enhanced recovery pathway, a multimodal prehabilitation program did not affect postoperative outcomes. Alternative strategies should be considered to optimize treatment of frail patients preoperatively. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02502760.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: 'Prehabilitation' is an intervention to enhance functional capacity in anticipation of a forthcoming physiological stressor. In patients scheduled for colorectal surgery, the extent to which a structured prehabilitation regimen of stationary cycling and strengthening optimized recovery of functional walking capacity after surgery was compared with a simpler regimen of walking and breathing exercises. METHODS: Some 112 patients (mean(s.d.) age 60(16) years) were randomized to either the structured bike and strengthening regimen (bike/strengthening group, 58 patients) or the simpler walking and breathing regimen (walk/breathing group, 54 patients). Randomization was done at the surgical planning visit; the mean time to surgery available for prehabilitation was 52 days; follow-up was for approximately 10 weeks after surgery. RESULTS: There were no differences between the groups in mean functional walking capacity over the prehabilitation period or at postoperative follow-up. The proportion showing an improvement in walking capacity was greater in the walk/breathing group than in the bike/strengthening group at the end of the prehabilitation period (47 versus 22 per cent respectively; P = 0.051) and after surgery (41 versus 11 per cent; P = 0.019). CONCLUSION: There was an unexpected benefit from the recommendation to increase walking and breathing, as designed for the control group. Adherence to recommendations was low. An examination of prehabilitation 'responders' would add valuable information.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The study investigated the effect of prehabilitation on the quality of life and function in patients having total knee replacement (TKR)/total hip replacement (THR). METHODS: A pilot randomized controlled trial with concealed allocation, assessor blinding, and intention-to-treat analysis was conducted. Sixty-four people undergoing elective lower-limb arthroplasty were included. Prehabilitation included one-hour twice-weekly sessions for at least three and a maximum of four weeks prior to surgery. Control participants did not complete any pre-surgical programs. Health utility and quality of life as measured by the EQ-5D-3L and the patient-specific functional scale were the primary outcomes measured before allocation and eight weeks post-operatively. RESULTS: No between-group differences were evident in health utility (main effect of the group -0.04 (95{\%} Confidence Interval {$[$}CI{$]$} -0.16 to 0.08, p = 0.50) or patient-specific functional scale (main effect of the group -0.59 (95{\%} CI -1.8 to 0.6, p = 0.73), but the group-by-joint interaction effects for the timed up and go (TUG) (7.6 (95{\%} CI -0.9 to 16.1, p = 0.08)) and the EQ-5D VAS (-18.3 (95{\%} CI -41.1 to 4.5), p = 0.11) were larger. Prehabilitation participants' knee flexion improved by 12.6 degrees (95{\%} CI 5.2-20, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Prehabilitation improved knee flexion, but this did not translate into improved functional mobility or quality of life.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Colon cancer in elderly patients is an increasing problem due to its prevalence and progressive aging population. Prehabilitation has experienced a great grown in this field. Whether it is the best standard of care for these patients has not been elucidated yet. METHODS: A retrospective comparative cohort study of three different standards of care for elderly colon cancer patients (>65 years) was conducted. A four-weeks trimodal prehabilitation program (PP), enhanced recovery program (ERP) and conventional care (CC) were compared. Global complications, major complications (Clavien-Dindo>/=3), reinterventions, mortality, readmission and length of stay were measured. Optimal recovery, defined as postoperative course without major complications, no mortality, hospital discharge before the fifth postoperative day and without readmission, was the primary outcome measure. The influence of standard of care in optimal recovery and postoperative outcomes was assessed with univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS: A total of 153 patients were included, 51 in each group. Mean age was 77.9 years. ASA Score distribution was different between groups (ASA III-IV: CC 56.9{\%}, ERP 25.5{\%}, PP 58.9{\%}; p = 0.014). Optimal recovery rate was 55.6{\%} (PP 54.9{\%}, ERP 66.7{\%}, CC 45.1{\%}; p = 0.09). No differences were found in major complications (p = 0.2) nor reinterventions (p = 0.7). Uneventful recovery favors ERP and PP groups (p = 0.046 and p = 0.049 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: PP and ERP are safe and effective for older colon cancer patients. Fewer overall complications and readmissions happened in ERP and PP patients. Major complications were independent of the standard of care used.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to assess the effect of preoperative immunonutrition on a nationwide scale. BACKGROUND: According to international guidelines, immunonutrition should be prescribed before major oncologic digestive surgery to decrease postoperative morbidity. Nevertheless, this practice remains controversial. METHODS: We used a prospective national health database named "Echantillon generaliste des Beneficiaires." Patients were selected with ICD10 codes of cancer and digestive surgery procedures from 2012 to 2016. Two groups were identified: with reimbursement of immunonutrition 45 days before surgery (IN-group) or not (no-IN-group). Primary outcome was 90-day severe morbidity. Secondary outcomes were postoperative length of stay (LOS) and overall survival. Logistic regression and survival analysis adjusted with IPW method were performed. RESULTS: One thousand seven hundred seventy-one patients were included. The proportion of different cancers was as follows: 72{\%} patients were included in the colorectal group, 14{\%} in the hepato-pancreato-biliary group, and 12{\%} in the upper gastrointestinal group. Patients from the IN-group (n = 606, 34{\%}) were younger (67.1 +/- 11.8 vs 69.2 +/- 12.2 years, P < 0.001), with increased use of other oral nutritional supplements (49.5{\%} vs 31.8{\%}, P < 0.001) and had more digestive anastomoses (89.4{\%} vs 83.0{\%}, P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the 2 groups for 90-day severe morbidity {$[$}odds ratio (OR): 0.91, 95{\%} confidence interval (95{\%} CI): 0.73-1.14{$]$} or in survival (hazard ratio: 0.89, 95{\%} CI: 0.73-1.08). LOS were shorter in the IN-group {$[$}-1.26 days, 95{\%} CI: -2.40 to -0.10){$]$}. CONCLUSION: The preoperative use of immunonutrition before major oncologic digestive surgery was not associated with any significant difference in morbidity or mortality.

	abstract = {AIM: The frail elderly surgical patient is at increased risk of morbidity after major surgery. A transdisciplinary Geriatric Surgery Service (GSS) has been shown to produce consistently positive results in our institution. A trans-institutional transdisciplinary Start to Finish (STF) programme was initiated incorporating seamless prehabilitation and rehabilitation to enhance the outcome further. METHOD: Patients who underwent major colorectal resection in Khoo Teck Puat Hospital and were managed under the GSS from January 2007 to December 2014 were included in this prospective study. The STF programme was initiated from January 2012. The surgical outcome of patients managed under the GSS before the initiation of STF was compared with that after its implementation. RESULTS: There were 57 patients after the initiation of the STF programme compared with 60 patients managed before STF. There were 26.4{\%} and 25{\%} of frail patients in the STF group compared with the non-STF group (P = 0.874). The mean length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the STF group (8.4 days vs 11.0 days, P = 0.029). Functional recovery in patients available for follow-up at 6 weeks showed 100{\%} (46/46) recovery in the elective STF group who received prehabilitation and 95.7{\%} (45/47) in the elective non-STF group who did not (P = 0.157). There were no significant differences in a Clavien-Dindo complication score of Grade 3 or more and 30-day mortality between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Through a trans-institutional transdisciplinary approach, we managed to achieve a significantly shorter hospital stay in frail patients having colorectal surgery. All elective patients who received prehabilitation achieved full functional recovery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Because obesity is a risk factor during surgery, the effects of a preoperative exercise program to reduce the incidence of peri- and postoperative complications in patients with a high body mass index (>25 kg/m(2)) and metabolic syndrome were investigated. An assessment of the effects of prospectively planned preoperative exercise was performed in a prospective matching study comparing an exercise testing group and a usual preoperative preparation group who underwent gastrectomy for gastric cancer in Japan. METHODS: Stage I gastric cancer patients with metabolic syndrome diagnosed according to the criteria of the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare underwent surgery after preoperative exercise. The control group was selected from a database using an individual matching approach for surgery, sex, weight, body mass index, volume of visceral fat, and institution. The primary end point was the frequency of postoperative complications such as cardiovascular events, pneumonia, and surgery-related abdominal complications. RESULTS: Data from a total of 72 patients (54 in the surgery-alone group, 18 in the preoperative exercise group) were analyzed. The median operative time and amount of bleeding were 208 min and 130 ml in the surgery-alone group and 248 min and 105 ml in the exercise group, respectively. Postoperative complications occurred in one case (5.5 {\%}) in the exercise group and 22 (40.7 {\%}) cases in the surgery-alone group. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative exercise is safe, and its benefits in reducing postoperative complications are promising and therefore warrant further investigation.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of preoperative immunonutrition on the rate of postoperative complication and survival of patients with gastric cancer. METHODS: A retrospective cohort was formed after data collection of patients hospitalized with gastric cancer. Postoperative complications classified according to the Clavien-Dindo classification system, length of hospital stay, readmissions, and rates of survival at 6 mo, 1 y, and 5 y were analyzed. A chi(2) or Fisher's exact test, Student or Mann-Whitney t test, and Kaplan-Meier and Cox regressions were used in the statistical analysis. RESULTS: A total of 164 patients were included in the study, with 56 patients assigned to the immunonutrition group and 108 to the conventional group. There were no significant differences in postoperative complications between the immunonutrition and conventional groups (51.8{\%} versus 58.3{\%}; P=0.423). The most frequent complications were fistula and surgical wound infection. Length of hospital stay did not differ between the groups (median of 7.0 d: P=0.615) and the presence of readmissions did not differ either (12.5{\%} versus 15.7{\%}; P=0.648). In the multivariate Cox regression, in a pooled model for group, age, sex, body mass index, Charlson comorbidity index, staging, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and type of surgery, there was a significant difference in survival rates at 6 mo (P=0.011), 1 y (P=0.006), and 5 y (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative immunonutrition in patients with gastric cancer did not reduce postoperative complications or length of hospital stay. More studies are needed to confirm the benefit of immunonutriton supplementation for overall survival when associated with other protective factors.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Evidence supporting physiotherapy prior to hip or knee replacement for decreasing pain and improving function pre and post-operatively is equivocal. This observational cohort study used a mixed-methods approach to investigate whether 8 weeks of physiotherapy led exercise and education ('prehabilitation') would change pain and functional outcomes prior to surgery, and if patients' expectations and satisfaction post-surgery were influenced. METHODS: Participants awaiting THR or TKR were recruited (n = 75). Fifty two opted into the 'prehabilitation' group while twenty three opted for usual care. The prehabilitation group included a 45 min exercise and 15 min education session twice weekly for 8 weeks. All participants completed the WOMAC, NRS, Health Thermometer, 5xSTS and TUG outcome measures. Data were collected before and after prehabilitation and 6 weeks after surgery. Qualitative data were collected from 22 participants via telephone interviews and analysed inductively. RESULTS: Both groups improved post surgery. The prehabilitation group showed statistically significant improvements in all outcome measures after prehabilitation (pre-surgery). Participants' felt prehabilitation prepared them well for surgery and influenced expectations post-operatively. Group education talks and the experience of friends and family appeared highly valued information sources. CONCLUSION: Prehabilitation improved patients' pain and function before hip or knee replacement surgery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Malnutrition is prevalent in oesophageal cancer. Evidence for the use of nutrition support and prehabilitation in this cohort is variable. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of early nutrition support and functional measures of nutritional status on post-operative outcomes in adult patients with oesophageal cancer. METHODS: Retrospective review of adults with oesophageal cancer undergoing oesophagectomy (n = 151). Early nutrition support was defined as: oral or enteral nutrition supplementation during neoadjuvant treatment. Late nutrition support defined as: oral or enteral nutrition supplementation prescribed post-operatively. Nutrition outcome measures were; percentage weight loss from 3 to 6 months prior to diagnosis, peri- and post-operatively, and pre-operative assessment of handgrip-strength (HGS). RESULTS: Pre-operative weight loss >/=10{\%} was a significant predictor of mortality at 1 year (OR 2.84, 95{\%}CI 1.03-7.83, p = 0.04) independent of tumour stage, adjuvant treatment, age and gender. Adults prescribed early nutrition support during neoadjuvant treatment experienced less weight loss at 12-months post-oesophagectomy compared to adults prescribed late oral nutrition support (p=<0.05). Pre-operative HGS measurements were not a useful predictor of postoperative complications (p = 0.2), length of stay (p = 0.9) or 90-day mortality (p = 0.6). CONCLUSIONS: Pre-operative weight loss >/=10{\%} was associated with mortality. Early nutrition support was associated with less weight loss at 12-months post-operatively. Pre-operative HGS measures did not have prognostic value as a stand-alone measure. Future work should investigate the efficacy of early nutrition support in reducing both pre- and post-operative weight loss to improve nutritional status and surgical outcomes as part of a multimodal prehabilitation programme in adults with oesophageal cancer.},

@article{9928,
	abstract = {AIM: Up to 50{\%} of the patients experience complications after colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery. Improved preoperative physical and nutritional status can enhance clinical outcomes and reduce postoperative complications. This retrospective, single-center, observational cohort study assessed the impact of a four-week multimodal prehabilitation program on postoperative complications, unplanned readmissions, length of stay, and mortality in elective high-risk CRC patients. METHOD: Elective high-risk CRC patients, defined as ASA >/=3 or >/=65yr, who attended the multimodal prehabilitation program (prehabilitation-group) were compared to a historical cohort receiving standard care (control-group). Differences in outcomes between these groups were tested using Fisher's Exact and Mann-Whitney U test. To adjust for confounding, multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed. The main study outcome was the occurrence of postoperative complications. Secondary outcomes included unplanned readmissions, length of hospital stay, and mortality. RESULTS: 351 patients were included (n = 275 control-group, n = 76 prehabilitation-group). The complication rate was lower in the prehabilitation group compared to the control group, 26.3{\%} (n = 20) versus 40{\%} (n = 110) (p = .032). There were fewer unplanned readmissions in the prehabilitation group compared to the control group, 5.3{\%} (n = 4) versus 16.4{\%} (n = 45), p = .014. Median hospital days of stay was 1 day shorter for the prehabilitation-group (p = .004), mortality did not significantly differ between the groups. CONCLUSION: This study shows that the used multimodal prehabilitation program leads to a reduction of medical postoperative complications, unplanned readmissions, and shortens the median hospital stay compared with standard care in high-risk CRC patients undergoing elective CRC surgery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Locally advanced esophageal cancer is often treated with neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery. Many patients present with or experience clinical deconditioning during neoadjuvant therapy. Prehabilitation programs in other areas of surgery have demonstrated improved postoperative outcomes. The aims of this study were to evaluate the feasibility of a pilot prehabilitation program and determine preliminary effects on surgical and cancer-related outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective review of patients treated at a single institution with resectable esophageal cancer was performed (n = 22). Patients in the prehabilitation group received protocol-structured intervention in several clinical domains including nutrition, psychosocial support, and physical exercise. RESULTS: Clinical stage and comorbidities were well matched between groups. The structured prehabilitation program was feasible and well received by participants. Fewer patients required admission during neoadjuvant therapy in the prehabilitation group (27.3{\%} versus 54.5{\%}). Percentage weight loss during treatment was 3.0{\%} in the prehabilitation group versus 4.3{\%} in the control group. Compared with the control group, the prehabilitation group demonstrated 0.0{\%} versus 18.2{\%} 30-d postoperative readmission rate and 18.2{\%} versus 27.3{\%} 90-d postoperative readmission rate. There were no statistically significant differences between groups in regard to complications or mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The pilot prehabilitation program demonstrated feasibility of implementing a structured program for patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy for esophageal cancer. Although the small population limits evaluation of statistical significance, trends in the data suggest a potential benefit of the prehabilitation program on neoadjuvant hospital admission rates, postsurgical readmission rates, and nutritional status.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Investigation of the feasibility and preliminary effect of a short-term intensive preoperative exercise programme for elderly patients scheduled for elective abdominal oncological surgery. DESIGN: Single-blind randomized controlled pilot study. SETTING: Ordinary hospital in the Netherlands. SUBJECTS: Forty-two elderly patients (>60 years). INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive a short-term intensive therapeutic exercise programme to improve muscle strength, aerobic capacity, and functional activities, given in the outpatient department (intervention group; n =22), or home-based exercise advice (control group; n=20). MAIN MEASURES: Parameters of feasibility, preoperative functional capacity and postoperative course. RESULTS: The intensive training programme was feasible, with a high compliance and no adverse events. Respiratory muscle endurance increased in the preoperative period from 259 +/- 273 to 404 +/- 349 J in the intervention group and differed significantly from that in the control group (350 +/- 299 to 305 +/- 323 J; P<0.01). Timed-Up-and-Go, chair rise time, LASA Physical Activity Questionnaire, Physical Work Capacity and Quality of Life (EORTC-C30) did not reveal significant differences between the two groups. There was no significant difference in postoperative complications and length of hospital stay between the two groups. CONCLUSION: The intensive therapeutic exercise programme was feasible and improved the respiratory function of patients due to undergo elective abdominal surgery compared with home-based exercise advice.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To investigate whether short-term perioperative cognitive therapy combined with rehabilitation exercise decreases the incidence of neurocognitive disorder (NCD) in elderly patients who have undergone hip joint replacement surgery. This was a randomized, parallel controlled trial on elderly patients who underwent unilateral total hip joint replacement surgery at the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University. METHODS: Patients in the perioperative cognitive therapy combined with rehabilitation exercise group underwent preoperative cognitive training and postoperative cognitive training, rehabilitation exercise, and standardized health care services; the control group received only postoperative standardized health care service. Patients with NCD were defined as those with two or more abnormalities on 11 neuropsychological tests. Of the 607 individuals that we screened, 86 (exercise, 50; control, 36) who completed the study were included. RESULTS: The baseline characteristics were similar for the two groups. The incidence of NCD in the exercise group (10{\%}, 5/50) was significantly lower than that in the control group (27.8{\%}, 10/36) (P=0.032). The HVLT-R, HVLT-R delayed recall test, and HVLT-R recognition discriminating index were significantly improved in the exercise group compared with the control group (all P<0.05). Our findings highlight the clinical significance of perioperative cognitive exercise combined with rehabilitation exercise in preventing NCD among patients after surgery and anesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that perioperative cognitive therapy combined with rehabilitation exercise can effectively reduce the incidence of NCD in elderly patients after total hip joint replacement surgery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are indications of beneficial short-term effect of pre-operative exercise in reducing pain and improving activity of daily living after total hip replacement (THR) and total knee replacement (TKR) surgery. Though, information from studies conducting longer follow-ups and economic evaluations of exercise prior to THR and TKR is needed. The aim of the study was to analyse 12-month clinical effect and cost-utility of supervised neuromuscular exercise prior to THR and TKR surgery. METHODS: The study was conducted alongside a randomised controlled trial including 165 patients scheduled for standard THR or TKR at a hospital located in a rural area of Denmark. The patients were randomised to replacement surgery with or without an 8-week preoperative supervised neuromuscular exercise program (Clinical Trials registration no.: NCT01003756). Clinical effect was measured with Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS) and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were based on EQ-5D-3L and Danish preference weights. Resource use was extracted from national registries and valued using standard tariffs (2012-EUR). Incremental net benefit was analysed to estimate the probability for the intervention being cost effective for a range of threshold values. A health care sector perspective was applied. RESULTS: HOOS/KOOS quality of life {$[$}8.25 (95{\%} CI, 0.42 to 16.10){$]$} and QALYs {$[$}0.04 (95{\%} CI, 0.01 to 0.07){$]$} were statistically significantly improved. Effect-sizes ranged between 0.09-0.59 for HOOS/KOOS subscales. Despite including an intervention cost of €326 per patient, there was no difference in total cost between groups {$[$}€132 (95{\%} CI -3942 to 3679){$]$}. At a threshold of €40,000, preoperative exercise was found to be cost effective at 84{\%} probability. CONCLUSION: Preoperative supervised neuromuscular exercise for 8 weeks was found to be cost-effective in patients scheduled for THR and TKR surgery at conventional thresholds for willingness to pay. One-year clinical effects were small to moderate and favoured the intervention group, but only statistically significant for quality of life measures.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The study was conducted to determine whether a multimodal prehabilitation program enhances postoperative functional recovery compared with multimodal rehabilitation. METHODS: Patients scheduled for non-small cell lung cancer resection were randomized to 2 groups receiving home-based moderate-intensity exercise, nutritional counseling with whey protein supplementation, and anxiety-reducing strategies for 4 weeks before the operation (PREHAB, n = 52) or 8 weeks after (REHAB, n = 43). Functional capacity (FC) was measured by the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) at baseline, immediately before the operation, and 4 and 8 weeks after operation. All patients were treated according to enhanced recovery pathway guidelines. RESULTS: There was no difference in FC at any point during the perioperative period between the 2 multimodal programs. By 8 weeks after operation, both groups returned to baseline FC, and a similar proportion of patients (>75{\%}) in both groups had recovered to their baseline. CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing surgical resection for lung cancer within the context of an enhanced recovery pathway, multimodal prehabilitation initiated 4 weeks before operation is as effective in recovering FC as multimodal rehabilitation.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To compare the feasibility (adherence) and effectiveness (prevalence of delirium, length of stay, mortality, discharge site) of delirium-friendly preprinted postoperative orders (PPOs) for individuals with hip fracture, administered by regular orthopedic nurses, with routine postoperative orders. DESIGN: Pragmatic clinical trial to evaluate a quality improvement intervention. SETTING: Tertiary care hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 65 and older admitted for hip fracture repair (N = 283). INTERVENTION: PPOs with delirium-friendly options and doses for nighttime sedation, analgesia, and nausea and attention to catheter removal and bowel movements. MEASUREMENTS: Adherence to PPO was compared with adherence to routine orders. Drug doses were recorded. Presence of delirium was documented using the Confusion Assessment Method and the Mini-Mental State Examination on postoperative Days 1, 3, and 5. Length of stay, discharge site, and in-hospital mortality were recorded. RESULTS: Orthopedic nurses adhered reasonably well with delirium-friendly PPOs. Of 283 participants, 42{\%} developed postoperative delirium, with significantly less delirium in the intervention group (intervention 33{\%}, control 51{\%}, P = .001). The effect of the intervention was stronger in individuals with preexisting dementia (intervention 60{\%}, control 97{\%}, P < .001). Participants with postoperative delirium had longer hospital stays and were more likely to die or be discharged to a nursing home, but there was no significant between-group difference in these outcomes. CONCLUSION: It is possible to introduce delirium-friendly PPOs into routine post-hip fracture care in a representative elderly population including individuals with dementia. Delirium-friendly PPOs executed by regular nursing staff resulted in a significant reduction in postoperative delirium but no difference in other outcomes.},

	abstract = {Prehabilitation aims to increase the endurance capacity of patients who are awaiting major surgery. However, there are no studies investigating the implementation of this demanding and expensive intervention in low-income countries. This study aimed to assess the impact of a 4-week trimodal prehabilitation program on the physical and psychological health of patients waiting for colorectal surgery compared with a control group managed according to enhanced recovery after surgery principles supplemented by nutritional care. This study was a single-centre, randomised controlled trial. The primary outcome measures for the physical aspects were 6-minute walking distance (6MWD) and incentive spirometry, whereas the psychological elements were measured using the 36-item short form survey questionnaire and the hospital anxiety and depression score. In total, data from 149 patients were analysed (77 in the prehabilitation group and 72 in the control group). At the time of surgery, patients in the prehabilitation group had improved 6MWD and incentive spirometry compared with the control group (median (IQR {$[$}range{$]$}) percentage improvement 131{\%} (112-173 {$[$}68-376{$]$}) vs. 107{\%} (99-120 {$[$}63-163{$]$}); p < 0.001 and 113{\%} (100-125 {$[$}75-200{$]$}) vs. 100{\%} (100-112 {$[$}86-167{$]$}); p < 0.001 respectively). Patients in the prehabilitation group also had reduced anxiety scores compared with the control group (mean (SD) anxiety score (4 (3) vs. 5 (3) respectively; p = 0.032). However, these effects did not translate into improvements in postoperative mortality and morbidity, or a reduction in duration of hospital stay. Trimodal (physical, emotional and nutritional) prehabilitation is able to improve functional status as well as some parameters of emotional and physical well-being of patients waiting for colorectal surgery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many patients demonstrate psychological distress and reduced physical activity before coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Here we evaluated the addition of a brief, cognitive-behavioural intervention (the HeartOp Programme) to routine nurse counselling for people waiting for CABG surgery. METHODS: Randomised controlled trial comparing nurse counselling with the HeartOp programme to routine nurse counselling in 204 patients awaiting first time elective CABG. Primary outcome measures were: anxiety and length of hospital stay; secondary outcome measures were: depression, physical functioning, cardiac misconceptions and cost utility. Measures were collected prior to randomisation and after 8 weeks of their intervention prior to surgery, excepting length of hospital stay which was collected after discharge following surgery. RESULTS: 100 patients were randomised to intervention, 104 to control. At follow-up there were no differences in anxiety or length of hospital stay. There were significant differences in depression (difference=7.79, p=0.008, 95{\%} CI=2.04-13.54), physical functioning (difference=0.82, p=0.001, 95{\%}CI=0.34-1.3) and cardiac misconceptions (difference=2.56, p<0.001, 95{\%}CI=1.64-3.48) in favour of the HeartOp Programme. The only difference to be maintained following surgery was in cardiac misconceptions. The HeartOp Programme was found to have an Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) of pound 288.83 per Quality-Adjusted Life Year. CONCLUSIONS: Nurse counselling with the HeartOp Programme reduces depression and cardiac misconceptions and improves physical functioning before bypass surgery significantly more than nurse counselling alone and meets the accepted criteria for cost efficacy.},

	abstract = {Major gastrointestinal surgery is associated with immune suppression and a high risk of postoperative complications. The aim of this open, randomized controlled trial was to examine the effect of supplementary per oral immunonutrition (IN) seven days before surgery for pancreatic cancer (PC) on postoperative complications and length of hospital stay (LOS). Secondary outcomes were the changes in functional capability and body weight (BW). Consecutive patients referred for surgery for diagnosed or plausible PC were included. The patients in the intervention group received supplementary IN (Oral Impact(R), Nestle) to reach a goal of 1.5 g protein/kg BW. The control group continued their habitual diet. Complications and LOS were independently assessed by the surgical staff. Secondary outcomes were measured 10, 20, and 30 days postoperatively. Thirty-five patients were included, of whom 19 (54{\%}) were allocated to the intervention group. The doses of IN ranged from 250 to 1000 ml per day and the median compliance was 100 (0-100{\%}). Based on the principle of intention-to-treat, no significant differences were found between the groups. We conclude that the lack of effect could be due to the limited dosage of IN, and/or because only 40{\%} of the patients were at nutritional risk.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Perioperative nutrition with specialized enteral diets improves outcome when compared with standard formulas. A post-hoc analysis suggested preoperative administration as the most important period. Thus, we designed a study to understand prospectively whether preoperative supplementation could be as efficacious as the perioperative approach and superior to a conventional treatment (no artificial nutrition) in reducing postoperative infections and length of hospital stay. METHODS: A total of 305 patients with preoperative weight loss <10{\%} and cancer of the gastrointestinal tract were randomized to receive the following: (1) oral supplementation for 5 days before surgery with 1 L/day of a formula enriched with arginine, omega-3 fatty acids, and RNA, with no nutritional support given after surgery (preoperative group, n = 102); (2) the same preoperative treatment plus postoperative jejunal infusion with the same enriched formula (perioperative group, n = 101); and (3) no artificial nutrition before and after surgery (conventional group; n = 102). RESULTS: The 3 groups were comparable for all baseline and surgical characteristics. Intention-to-treat analysis showed a 13.7{\%} incidence of postoperative infections in the preoperative group, 15.8{\%} in the perioperative group, and 30.4{\%} in the conventional group (P = 0.006 vs. preoperative; P = 0.02 vs. perioperative). Length of hospital stay was 11.6 +/- 4.7 days in the preoperative group, 12.2 +/- 4.1 days in the perioperative group, and 14.0 +/- 7.7 days in the conventional group (P = 0.008 vs. preoperative and P = 0.03 vs. perioperative). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative supplementation is as effective as perioperative administration in improving outcome. Both strategies seem superior to the conventional approach.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A recent study suggested that the anti-inflammatory effect of immunonutrition starts after only two d. We therefore investigated the effect of an immunoenriched oral diet administered for three d preoperatively. METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, well-nourished patients (Nutrition Risk Screening 2002 <3) with gastrointestinal cancer who were scheduled for major elective abdominal cancer surgery were randomly assigned to either 750 mL of an immunoenriched formula (IEF group) or 750 mL of an isocaloric, isonitrogenous placebo diet (Con group) for 3 consecutive d preoperatively. RESULTS: A total of 108 patients (IEF group: n = 55; Con group: n = 53) were randomized. The two groups were comparable for all baseline and surgical characteristics. The overall mortality was 2.8{\%} and not significantly different between the two groups (IEF group: 3.6{\%} vs. Con group: 1.9{\%}, P = 1.00). Intention-to-treat analysis showed no difference for the incidence of postoperative overall (IEF group: 29{\%} vs. Con group: 30{\%}; P = 1.00) and infectious (IEF group: 15{\%} vs. Con group: 17{\%}; P = 0.79) complications. Length of hospital stay was 12 +/- 4.9 d in the IEF group and 11.6 +/- 5.3 d in the Con group (P = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative oral supplementation with an immunoenriched diet for 3 d preoperatively did not improve postoperative outcome compared with the placebo in well-nourished patients with elective gastrointestinal cancer surgery.},

	abstract = {Almost two in three patients who are aged 75 years and older and scheduled for surgery for colorectal cancer (CRC) are undernourished. Despite evidence that perioperative nutritional management can improve patients outcomes, international guidelines are still insufficiently applied in current practice. In this stepped-wedge cluster-randomized study of five surgical hospitals, we included 147 patients aged 70 years or older with scheduled abdominal surgery for CRC between October 2013 and December 2016. In the intervention condition, an outreach team comprising a geriatrician and a dietician visited patients and staff in surgical wards to assist with the correct application of guidelines. Evaluation, diagnosis, and prescription (according to nutritional status) were considered appropriate and strictly consistent with guidelines in 39.2{\%} of patients in the intervention group compared to only 1.4{\%} in the control group (p = 0.0002). Prescription of oral nutritional supplements during the perioperative period was significantly improved (41.9{\%} vs. 4.1{\%}; p < 0.0001). However, there were no benefits of the intervention on surgical complications or adverse events. A possible benefit of hospital stay reduction will need to be confirmed in further studies. This study highlights the importance of the implementation of quality improvement interventions into current practice for the perioperative nutritional management of older patients with CRC.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a home-based physical therapy (PT) program prevented decline in several higher-level measures of physical function among physically frail, community-living older persons. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: General community. PARTICIPANTS: Persons (N=188) who were physically frail and aged 75 years or older. INTERVENTION: A home-based PT program (ie, prehabilitation) that focused primarily on improving underlying impairments in physical capabilities. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs); mobility, as determined by a modified version of the Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment; timed rapid gait and timed chair stands; and integrated physical performance, as determined by a modified version of the Physical Performance Test, were assessed at baseline, 7 months, and 12 months. RESULTS: As compared with participants in the educational control group, participants in the intervention group had reductions in IADL disability of 17.7{\%} at 7 months (P=.036) and 12.0{\%} at 12 months (P=.143) and had gains, ranging from 7.2{\%} to 15.6{\%}, in mobility and integrated physical performance at 7 and 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Our home-based prehabilitation program offered modest but consistent benefits for the prevention of decline in several higher-level measures of physical function.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The preoperative period (prehabilitation) may represent a more appropriate time than the postoperative period to implement an intervention. The impact of prehabilitation on recovery of function al exercise capacity was thus studied in patients undergoing colorectal resection for cancer. METHODS: A parallel-arm single-blind superiority randomized controlled trial was conducted. Seventy-seven patients were randomized to receive either prehabilitation (n = 38) or rehabilitation (n = 39). Both groups received a home-based intervention of moderate aerobic and resistance exercises, nutritional counseling with protein supplementation, and relaxation exercises initiated either 4 weeks before surgery (prehabilitation) or immediately after surgery (rehabilitation), and continued for 8 weeks after surgery. Patients were managed with an enhanced recovery pathway. Primary outcome was functional exercise capacity measured using the validated 6-min walk test. RESULTS: Median duration of prehabilitation was 24.5 days. While awaiting surgery, functional walking capacity increased (≥20 m) in a higher proportion of the prehabilitation group compared with the rehabilitation group (53 vs. 15{\%}, adjusted P = 0.006). Complication rates and duration of hospital stay were similar. The difference between baseline and 8-week 6-min walking test was significantly higher in the prehabilitation compared with the rehabilitation group (+23.7 m {$[$}SD, 54.8{$]$} vs. -21.8 m {$[$}SD, 80.7{$]$}; mean difference 45.4 m {$[$}95{\%} CI, 13.9 to 77.0{$]$}). A higher proportion of the prehabilitation group were also recovered to or above baseline exercise capacity at 8 weeks compared with the rehabilitation group (84 vs. 62{\%}, adjusted P = 0.049). CONCLUSION: Meaningful changes in postoperative functional exercise capacity can be achieved with a prehabilitation program.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A previous comprehensive prehabilitation program, providing nutrition counseling with whey protein supplementation, exercise, and psychological care, initiated 4 weeks before colorectal surgery for cancer, improved functional capacity before surgery and accelerated functional recovery. Those receiving standard of care deteriorated. The specific role of nutritional prehabilitation alone on functional recovery is unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to estimate the impact of nutrition counseling with whey protein on preoperative functional walking capacity and recovery in patients undergoing colorectal resection for cancer. DESIGN: We conducted a double-blinded randomized controlled trial at a single university-affiliated tertiary center located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Colon cancer patients (n=48) awaiting elective surgery for nonmetastatic disease were randomized to receive either individualized nutrition counseling with whey protein supplementation to meet protein needs or individualized nutrition counseling with a nonnutritive placebo. Counseling and supplementation began 4 weeks before surgery and continued for 4 weeks after surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome was change in functional walking capacity as measured with the 6-minute walk test. The distance was recorded at baseline, the day of surgery, and 4 weeks after surgery. A change of 20 m was considered clinically meaningful. RESULTS: The whey group experienced a mean improvement in functional walking capacity before surgery of +20.8 m, with a standard deviation of 42.6 m, and the placebo group improved by +1.2 (65.5) m (P=0.27). Four weeks after surgery, recovery rates were similar between groups (P=0.81). CONCLUSION: Clinically meaningful improvements in functional walking capacity were achieved before surgery with whey protein supplementation. These pilot results are encouraging and justify larger-scale trials to define the specific role of nutrition prehabilitation on functional recovery after surgery.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The advent of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in an increase in sedentary behavior, with consequences on cardiopulmonary capacity, especially in the elderly population. Prehabilitation is a strategy usually used before a surgical procedure to improve functional capacity; however, it can be used for non-surgical patients and not in the acute phase of disease. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a prehabilitation program, using telerehabilitation, in frail elderly patients with chronic heart failure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a randomized, controlled, single-blind study. Fifteen patients with chronic heart failure were randomized into three groups: two active groups (telerehabilitation and in-person) and the control group. Patients in the active groups underwent a rehabilitation program divided into two 4-week periods, for 45-60 minutes per day, 2 days per week. RESULTS: In the Study Group, the quality of life significantly improved (EQoL-5D), and between the two groups a statistically significant difference in the motor dimension of SF-36 was identified. CONCLUSIONS: The telerehabilitation prehabilitation program for patients with chronic heart failure was confirmed to be effective and not inferior to a prehabilitation program performed in-person, avoiding the worsening of some domains of quality of life and motor performance, and leading to the improvement of others.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Currently, there are solely weak recommendations in the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol regarding the role of preoperative physical activity and prehabilitation in patients undergoing colorectal surgery. Studies in heterogenous groups showed contradictory results regarding the impact of prehabilitation on the reduction of postoperative complications. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of prehabilitation on postoperative complications in patients undergoing colorectal surgery within an ERAS protocol. METHODS: Between July 2016 and June 2019, a single-center, blinded, randomized controlled trial designed to test whether physiotherapeutic prehabilitation vs. normal physical activities prior to colorectal surgery may decrease morbidity within a stringent ERAS protocol was carried out. The primary endpoint was postoperative complications assessed by Comprehensive Complications Index (CCI(R)). Primary and secondary endpoints for both groups were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: A total of 107 patients (54 in the prehabilitation enhanced recovery after colorectal surgery {$[$}pERACS{$]$} group and 53 in the control group) were included in the study and randomized. Dropout rate was 4.5{\%} (n = 5). Baseline characteristics were comparable between the pERACS and control groups. The percentage of colorectal adenocarcinoma was low in both groups (pERACS 32{\%} vs. control 23{\%}, p = 0.384). Almost all patients underwent minimally invasive surgery in both groups (96{\%} vs. 98{\%}, p = 1.000). There was no between-group difference in the primary outcome, as the mean CCI at 30-day postoperative in the pERACS group was 18 (SD 0-43) compared to 15 (SD 0-49) in the control group (p = 0.059). Secondary outcome as complications assessed according to Clavien-Dindo, length of hospital stay, reoperation rate, and mortality showed no difference between both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Routine physiotherapeutic prehabilitation has no additional benefit for patients undergoing colorectal surgery within an ERAS protocol.

	abstract = {Objective. To determine the effect of the start-to-finish programme by comparing outcomes of elderly patients who underwent colorectal surgery before and after introduction of the programme. Methods: Data of consecutive patients aged =75 years who underwent major colorectal surgery (open, minimally invasive, elective, or emergency) between February 2007 and November 2015 at our institution were collected prospectively. Postoperative outcomes of patients were compared before and after the July 2013 introduction of the start-to-finish programme. Patients were risk-stratified for decision on whether prehabilitation was required, based on frailty syndrome, weighted Charlson Comorbidity Index, and ambulatory status. Frailty was defined as presentation of three or more of the following criteria: unintentional weight loss, self-reported exhaustion, weakness (grip strength), slow walking speed, and low physical activity. Outcome measures included discharge destination, functional decline in terms of a loss of =10 points in the Barthel Index at postoperative week 6, length of hospital stay, postoperative complication in terms of a Clavien-Dindo score of =3, and 30-day mortality. Results: A total of 121 geriatric patients were recruited and followed up for a mean duration of 36 months. Of whom, 49 (40.1{\%}) were recruited after the introduction of start-to-finish programme in July 2013. 34 (28.1{\%}) of the 121 patients were determined to be frail. In multivariate analysis, frailty was the only predictor of discharge destination (odds ratio {$[$}OR{$]$}=6.067, p=0.001). Patients with a Clavien-Dindo score of =3 were more likely to have functional decline at postoperative week 6 (OR=83.926, p=0.003). The start-to-finish programme (OR=0.067, p=0.023) and elective surgery (OR=0.091, p=0.024) were associated with maintenance of functional. Frailty was associated with discharge to facilities other than home (OR=6.067, p=0.001) and a steeper decline on longer-term follow-up. Conclusion: The start-to-finish programme had a positive effect on reducing functional decline after colorectal surgery. Frail patients and patients with major complications require special attention to mitigate the steep functional decline. {\copyright}2019 The Hong Kong Geriatrics Society and Hong Kong Association of Gerontology.},

	abstract = {Proprioceptive deficiencies due to osteoarthritis and arthroplasty have been repeatedly reported. Proprioceptive training, which leads to an economisation of movements and supports energy-saving movement patterns, has become popular in athletes, but not in rehabilitation yet. The aim of this randomised phase IIb study was to evaluate whether preoperative proprioceptive training would influence postoperative balance and function in activities of daily life in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. Subjects with severe osteoarthritis of the knee scheduled for TKA were randomised to either a control group (CG) or a training group (TG). All patients were examined 6 weeks before and 6 weeks after TKA, patients of the TG also one day before surgery, i.e. after six weeks of preoperative proprioceptive training, in order to evaluate the influence of training without TKA. Evaluation included balance assessment using the Biodex Stability System, as well as measurements of gait speed and clinical outcome using the WOMAC and Knee Society Score. As opposed to the CG, stance stability improved significantly in the TG (Biodex OSI (p=0.045), APSI (p=0.029)) 6 weeks after TKA. There was a significant improvement in KSS, WOMAC pain and stiffness in both groups after TKA. Preoperative proprioceptive training in patients undergoing TKA resulted in improved standing balance, but no difference in clinical outcome was observed between the two groups.},

	abstract = {AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aims were to investigate whether there were any differences between patients receiving nutritional intervention preoperatively and over five days postoperatively and patients who did not, in terms of postoperative complications, rehabilitation, length of stay and food and liquid intake. BACKGROUND: Patients with hip fractures are often malnourished at admission to hospital and they typically do not receive the energy and calories needed postoperatively. DESIGN: The design was a quasi-experimental, pre- and post-test comparison group design without random group assignment. METHODS: One hundred patients with hip fractures were consecutively included. The control group (n = 50) received regular nutritional support. The intervention group (n = 50) received nutrition according to nutritional guidelines. The outcome measures used were risk of pressure ulcer, pressure ulcers, weight, nosocomial infections, cognitive ability, walking assistance and functional ability, collected preoperatively and five days postoperatively. Each patient's nutrient and liquid intake were assessed daily for five days postoperatively. RESULTS: Significantly fewer (p = 0.043) patients in the intervention group (18{\%}) had pressure ulcers five days postoperatively compared with the control group (36{\%}). Nutrient and liquid intake was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in the intervention group. Median length of stay decreased from nine to seven days (p = 0.137), as did nosocomial infections, from 18-8.7{\%} (p = 0.137). CONCLUSION: Patients with hip fractures receiving nutrition according to nutritional guidelines developed fewer pressure ulcers. This is invaluable to patients' quality of life and a major economic saving for society. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Great benefits can be gained for the patients through modest efforts by nurses and physicians such as nutritional intervention.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of multicomponent, nonpharmacologic interventions (MNI) on perioperative cortisol and melatonin levels, as well as postoperative delirium (PD), in elderly oral cancer patients. METHODS: A total of 160 elderly oral cancer patients who underwent tumor resection surgery and completed our investigation were included in this study. The cancer patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: Group U or Group I. During the perioperative period, Group U received usual care, while Group I received MNI, which is based on usual care and aims to decrease the risk of PD. MNI focused on general geriatric approaches and supportive nursing care. On the day before surgery and the first three postoperative days, nocturnal (20:00-8:00) urine samples were collected. The melatonin sulfate and cortisol levels in the urine samples were determined. Moreover, the RASS (Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale), CAM-ICU (Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit) and QoR40 (40-item quality of recovery score) scores were dynamically monitored. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the general characteristics between the 2 groups. After surgery, the melatonin sulfate levels in the nocturnal urine of Group I were higher than those in Group U. The cortisol concentrations were lower in Group I compared to those in Group U. Group I achieved better postoperative RASS and QoR40 scores than Group U. Compared to Group U, Group I also experienced less PD (incidence and duration). CONCLUSIONS: MNI ameliorated some postoperative disturbances regarding sleep and stress, decreased the incidence of PD and improved recovery quality.},

@article{6231,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The rising prevalence of modifiable lifestyle-related risk factors (e.g. overweight and physical inactivity) suggests the need for effective and safe preoperative interventions to improve outcomes after cardiac surgery. This retrospective study explored potential short-term postoperative benefits and unintended consequences of a multidisciplinary prehabilitation program regarding in-hospital complications. METHODS: Data on patients who underwent elective cardiac surgery between January 2014 and April 2017 were analyzed retrospectively. Pearson's chi-squared tests were used to compare patients who followed prehabilitation (three times per week, at a minimum of three weeks) during the waiting period with patients who received no prehabilitation. Sensitivity analyses were performed using propensity-score matching, in which the propensity score was based on the baseline variables that affected the outcomes. RESULTS: Of 1201 patients referred for elective cardiac surgery, 880 patients met the inclusion criteria, of whom 91 followed prehabilitation (53.8{\%} ≥65 years, 78.0{\%} male, median Euroscore II 1.3, IQR, 0.9-2.7) and 789 received no prehabilitation (60.7{\%} ≥65 years, 69.6{\%} male, median Euroscore II 1.6, IQR, 1.0-2.8). The incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) was significantly lower in the prehabilitation group compared to the unmatched and matched standard care group (resp. 14.3{\%} vs. 23.8{\%}, P = 0.040 and 14.3{\%} vs. 25.3{\%}, P = 0.030). For the other complications, no between-group differences were found. CONCLUSIONS: Prehabilitation might be beneficial to prevent postoperative AF. Patients participated safely in prehabilitation and were not at higher risk for postoperative complications. However, well-powered randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm and deepen these results.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and feasibility of progressive explosive-type resistance training (RT) in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip scheduled for total hip arthroplasty (THA). METHOD: Randomized controlled trial (1:1) in patients diagnosed with hip OA and scheduled for THA. The intervention group (IG) performed supervised preoperative progressive explosive-type RT twice a week for 10 weeks; four exercises (hip/thigh) performed in three series each (8-12 repetition maximum). The control group (CG) received 'care as usual'. Efficacy was reported as the between-group difference in the Hip Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS) (primary endpoint; ADL function), and leg muscle power at post intervention follow-up immediate before surgery. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed in a multilevel regression model adjusting for baseline, sex, age and weight. Feasibility was reported as adherence, exercise related pain and adverse effects. Post-surgical follow up will be reported separately. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT01164111. RESULTS: Eighty patients (age 70.4 +/- 7.6 years, BMI 27.8 +/- 4.6, 52 females (65{\%}) were included. Adherence was high (93{\%}) with acceptable exercise related pain (VAS score </= 5) reported in 83{\%} of sessions and no adverse events. Changes in HOOS 'function' was 10.0 points 95{\%}CI {$[$}4.7; 15.3{$]$} higher in IG compared to CG (P < 0.001). For all the remaining HOOS subscales IG scored significantly better (P < 0.03) and had higher leg extension muscle power (P < 0.0001) compared to CG. CONCLUSION: Progressive explosive-type RT was feasible in the included group of hip OA patients scheduled for THA and resulted in significant improvement in self-reported outcomes and increased leg muscle power.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Aim of this study was to determine whether peri-operative immunonutrition can decrease complications and the length of stay (LOS) in malnourished ovarian cancer patients. STUDY DESIGN: Patients suspicious for advanced ovarian cancer before histopathological diagnosis and a nutritional risk score (NRS) >/= 3 received oral immune-modulating diets (IMDs) for 5 days pre-operative and at least 5 days post-operative. Parameters for clinical outcome were infectious and non-infectious complications during hospital stay, and time of hospitalization. The results were compared with malnourished ovarian cancer patients of a previous study without any additive nutritional support (standard clinical diet/nutrition). RESULTS: The infectious and non-infectious complication rate in the interventional group (IG) N = 28 was 42.9{\%}, similar to the control group (CG) N = 19 with 42.1{\%}, whereas the rate of infectious complications in the IG (21.4{\%}) was slightly lower compared to the CG (26.3{\%}). The median LOS of the IG was 18 days, and therefore, longer than LOS of the CG (15 days). Regarding the patients' compliance pre-operative 78.6{\%} of the patients took the IMDs in an optimal and sufficient amount. Whereas after surgery, only eight (28.6{\%}) patients were able to take IMDs in optimal and sufficient amount. CONCLUSIONS: The current study showed no improvement of the complication rate or the time of hospitalization due to additional peri-operative immunonutrition in malnourished ovarian cancer patients. However, a trend towards the reduction of infectious complications could be seen in the IG.},

	abstract = {The perioperative care of patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) affects functional recovery and clinical outcomes. This study aims to introduce a patient-specific integrated education program (IEP) into the TKA clinical pathway and to evaluate patient outcomes between the intervention and control groups. We performed a two-site, two-arm, parallel-prospective controlled trial. The experiment group received an IEP incorporating verbal preoperative education, prehabilitation, multidisciplinary personalized rehabilitation during hospitalization, and supervised self-executed home-based exercise after discharge. The control group received regular TKA clinical care. We monitored the pain intensity, anxiety scores, and functional scores at six time points from the pre-operation interview to 3 months post-operation. The pain score was significantly decreased in the IEP group during hospitalization (p {$<$} 0.01) and before discharge (p {$<$} 0.05). The anxiety status was also improved after intervention in terms of state and trait anxiety inventory scores (p {$<$} 0.001) during hospitalization. The patient-reported (WOMAC) or physician-reported (American Knee Society Score) functional scores (p {$<$} 0.01 at most of the time points) all improved significantly under hospitalization. We found that the patient-specific IEP combining preoperative education, prehabilitation, the in-hospital group education class, and postoperative care navigation is effective in reducing postoperative pain, decreasing perioperative anxiety, and facilitating functional recovery following TKA.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate 1-year postoperative effect of preoperative resistance training (RT) in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA) on patient-reported outcomes on activity and function and objective outcomes on muscle strength and physical performance. DESIGN: A 3-12 months follow-up of a randomized controlled trial. Patients scheduled for THA were randomized into: RT-group, twice a week for 10 weeks prior to THA, or 'care-as-usual' (CG). Primary endpoint of this sequel analysis is HOOS-ADL at 12 months follow-up. Secondary outcome measures are; other HOOS subscales, knee- and hip muscle strength plus function (gait, ascending/descending stairs, and sit-to-stand) at three and/or 12 months. CLINICALTRIALS.GOV: NCT01164111. RESULTS: Eighty patients (70{\%} women, 70.4 $\pm$7.6 years, BMI of 27.8 $\pm$4.6) were randomized to RT (n = 40) or CG (n = 40); data from 85{\%} were available at 12 months. No superior effects were observed at 12 months for HOOS ADL (between-group change score {$[$}95{\%}CI{$]$}) (2.6 {$[$}-4.2; 9.8{$]$}, P = 0.44) or remaining subscales. However, ascending (1.3 s {$[$}0.3; 2.3{$]$}, P = 0.01)) and descending stairs (1.6 s {$[$}0.3; 2.9{$]$}, P = 0.01) demonstrated additional effects. At 3 months clinically relevant change-scores in favour of RT was observed on HOOS-Sport/Rec (10.5 points {$[$}1.4; 19.6{$]$}, P = 0.023), together with higher knee strength of the affected side (14.6 Nm {$[$}6.3; 22.9{$]$}, P < 0.001), and selected outcomes of physical function. CONCLUSIONS: At 12 months after surgery, there was no additional effect of preoperative RT compared with THA alone, but rehabilitation was accelerated at 3 months.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: A prospective study was conducted to ascertain the effects of preoperative enteral immunonutrition on a surgical site infection (SSI) in patients with colorectal cancer without malnutrition. METHODS: Patients with colorectal cancer undergoing elective surgery without malnutrition, bowel obstruction, severe cardiopulmonary complications, diabetes, collagen disease, or renal failure were sequentially divided into an immunonutrition group (n = 33) and a control group (n = 34). In the immunonutrition group, an enteral diet supplemented with arginine, dietary nucleotides, and omega-3 fatty acids was administered for 5 days (750 ml/day) prior to surgery. RESULTS: The mean age was slightly higher in the immunonutrition group (69 +/- 9 years) than in the control group (63 +/- 11 years; P < 0.05), but no significant differences between the groups were noted for the body mass index, total protein, albumin, hemoglobin, surgical methods, operation time, or volume of intraoperative bleeding. The frequencies of superficial incisional SSI, deep incisional SSI and organ/space SSI in the immunonutrition and control groups were 0{\%} and 11.8{\%} (4/34; P < 0.05), 0{\%} and 0{\%}, and 0{\%} and 2.9{\%} (1/34), respectively. CONCLUSION: Preoperative enteral immunonutrition appears to be effective for preventing SSI in patients with colorectal cancer without malnutrition.},

	abstract = {Background: The feasibility and practicality of preoperative rehabilitation (PR) programs remains quite controversial in the treatment of lung cancer (LC). This study explored whether a short-term high-intensity rehabilitation program could improve postoperative outcomes compared to those achieved with conventional inspiratory muscle training (IMT). Methods: A three-armed randomized controlled trial comparing the two training modalities and routine care was conducted in surgical LC patients. Patient groups received one of three treatment regimens: (I) high-intensity pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) that combined IMT with conventional resistance training (CRT) (combined PR group); (II) conventional PR (single IMT group); or (III) routine preoperative preparation (control group). The primary endpoint was a change in the occurrence of post-operative pulmonary complications (PPCs) that occurred within 30 days after surgery, while secondary endpoints included changes in length of hospital stay, quality of life (QoL) scores, 6-min walk distance (6-MWD) and peak expiratory flow (PEF). Results: A total of 90 enrolled patients were randomized into three groups with a computer-based 1:1:1 ratio. The intention-to-treat analysis of the study revealed that, compared with the Control Group, the Combined PR Group had a significant increase in Δ6-MWD (by 32.67 m, P=0.002), ΔPEF (by 14.3 L/min, P=0.001), Δglobal scores (by 3.7, P=0.035); and a reduced Δaverage total hospital stay (by 3.2 d, P=0.001) and Δpostoperative stay (by 3.6 d, P=0.001). With regard to PPC rate, the Combined PR Group had a somewhat lower PPC severity (grade II-V) compared to the Control Group. Conclusions: This hospital-based short-term program of PR combining high-intensity IMT with CRT was significantly superior to the conventional IMT program, indicating that this approach would be a feasible strategy for treating LC patients, especially those waiting operations with surgery-related risk factors.},

	abstract = {In patients with severe knee osteoarthritis (OA), total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is performed for both symptom relief and to achieve better function in daily life. Implementation of efficient TKA rehabilitation programs with shorter length of stay (LOS) and reduced medical expenditures is an important issue in clinical practice. However, the effectiveness of preoperative rehabilitation programs is still under debate. Most preoperative rehabilitation programs last many weeks and may be more expensive than TKA. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a simplified, easy-to-learn, and less time-consuming preoperative rehabilitation education program on TKA patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this randomized controlled study, we allocated all the patients into study and control group according to chart number. The study group, which comprised 126 patients, participated in a 40-min preoperative home rehabilitation education program 4 weeks prior to TKA. One hundred seventeen patients in the control group did not participate in this preoperative program. RESULTS: The study group required a shorter hospital LOS (mean: 7.12 days; P=0.027) and had less hospitalization-related medical expenditures (mean: 123726 New Taiwan dollars {$[$}NTD{$]$}, equivalent to 4266.4 United States dollars {$[$}USD{$]$} or 3022.1 {$[$}Euros{$]$}), (P=0.001) than the control group. However, the study group showed no significant improvement in function when compared to the control group. DISCUSSION: Our study demonstrates that a simplified preoperative rehabilitation program can reduce LOS and increase cost savings. This program was recommended as a routine protocol for OA patients before admission for TKA.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Improving functional status preoperatively through exercise may improve postoperative outcome. Previous knowledge on preoperative exercise in knee osteoarthritis is insufficient. The aim of the study was to compare the difference in change between groups in lower extremity function from baseline to 3 months after Total Knee Replacement (TKR) following a neuromuscular exercise programme (NEMEX-TJR) plus a knee school educational package (KS) or KS alone. METHODS: 45 patients (55-83 years, 53{\%} male, waiting for TKR) were randomized to receive a minimum of 8 sessions of NEMEXTJR plus 3 sessions of KS or 3 sessions of KS alone. Function was assessed with the Chair Stand Test (CST, primary endpoint) and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) subscales focusing on daily living function (ADL) and pain (secondary endpoints). Assessments were performed immediately before and after the intervention, and at 6 weeks, 3 months and 12 months after surgery by a physiotherapist, blinded to group allocation. RESULTS: After intervention before surgery we observed a small improvement for primary and secondary endpoints in both groups, which did not differ significantly between groups: comparing the exercise to the control group the treatment effect for the CST was -1.5 seconds (95{\%} CI: -5.3, 2.2), for KOOS ADL and KOOS pain the treatment effect was 1.3 points (-10.1, 12.8) and -2.3 (-12.4, 7.9) respectively. At 3 months after surgery we observed a small improvement in the primary endpoint in the control group and a significant improvement in the secondary endpoints in both exercise and control groups, which did not differ significantly between groups: comparing the exercise group to the control group the treatment effect in the CST was 2.0 seconds (-1.8, 5.8), for KOOS ADL and KOOS pain the treatment effect was -4.9 points (-16.3, 6.5) and -3.3 points (-13.5, 6.8) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A median (IQR) of 10 (8, 14) exercise sessions before surgery showed an additional small but non-significant improvement in all functional assessments compared to patient education alone. These benefits were not sustained after TKR. Our trial doesn't give a conclusive answer to whether additional preoperative exercise on postoperative functional outcomes is beneficial.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The nutritional status of esophageal cancer patients during neoadjuvant therapy remains a challenging problem. The objective of this study was to determine whether routine enteral feeding tube placement improved nutritional status and perioperative outcomes for patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy for esophageal cancer. METHODS: The Society of Thoracic Surgeons database was used to identify patients who underwent neoadjuvant therapy and esophagectomy at our institution between 2010 and 2014. Nutritional status before and after neoadjuvant therapy was determined through standardized nutrition consultations. Predictors of change in nutrition and adverse events were evaluated with multivariable and univariate logistic regressions. RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-four esophagectomy patients were identified, and 127 (54{\%}) received neoadjuvant therapy. Of those receiving neoadjuvant therapy, 80{\%} (102/127) presented with dysphagia, and 48{\%} (61/127) received enteral feeding access (EA). Multivariable regression revealed that high initial albumin level, high initial body mass index, and presence of EA were associated with nutritional stability during neoadjuvant therapy. However, 27.9{\%} (17/61) of patients who received EA did not use their access at all or did not use it consistently during the course of preoperative treatment. The preoperative grades of malnutrition and esophagectomy outcomes were similar between groups (EA vs no EA). CONCLUSIONS: EA is associated with improved nutritional status for patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy for esophageal cancer. However, adverse events and suboptimal use are common. Esophagectomy outcomes were similar for patients with and without EA. These results support judicious patient selection for EA, expedited neoadjuvant therapy, and close collaboration with nutritionists.},

	abstract = {Importance: Postoperative delirium in older adults is a common and costly complication after surgery. Cognitive reserve affects the risk of postoperative delirium, and thus preoperative augmentation of reserve as a preventive technique is of vital interest. Objective: To determine whether cognitive prehabilitation reduces the incidence of postoperative delirium among older adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a prospective, single-blinded randomized clinical trial conducted from March 2015 to August 2019 at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus. Patients 60 years and older undergoing major, noncardiac, nonneurological surgery under general anesthesia, with an expected hospital stay of at least 72 hours, were eligible for trial inclusion. Patients were excluded for preoperative cognitive dysfunction and active depression. Interventions: Participation in electronic, tablet-based preoperative cognitive exercise targeting memory, speed, attention, flexibility, and problem-solving functions. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was incidence of delirium between postoperative day 0 to day 7 or discharge, as measured by a brief Confusion Assessment Method, Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale, or a structured medical record review. Secondary outcomes compared delirium characteristics between patients in the intervention and control groups. Results: Of the 699 patients approached for trial participation, 322 completed consent and 268 were randomized. Subsequently, 17 patients were excluded, leaving 251 patients in the primary outcome analysis. A total of 125 patients in the intervention group and 126 control patients were included in the final analysis (median {$[$}interquartile range{$]$} age, 67 {$[$}63-71{$]$} years; 163 women {$[$}64.9{\%}{$]$}). Ninety-seven percent of the patients in the intervention group completed some brain exercise (median, 4.6 {$[$}interquartile range, 1.31-7.4{$]$} hours). The delirium rate among control participants was 23.0{\%} (29 of 126). With intention-to-treat analysis, the delirium rate in the intervention group was 14.4{\%} (18 of 125; P = .08). Post hoc analysis removed 4 patients who did not attempt any cognitive exercise from the intervention group, yielding a delirium rate of 13.2{\%} (16 of 121; P = .04). Secondary analyses among patients with delirium showed no differences in postoperative delirium onset day or duration or total delirium-positive days across study groups. Conclusions and Relevance: The intervention lowered delirium risk in patients who were at least minimally compliant. The ideal activities, timing, and effective dosage for cognitive exercise-based interventions to decrease postoperative delirium risk and burden need further study.

The purpose of this retrospective cohort study was to investigate the possible prevention of PPCs by intensive preoperative respiratory rehabilitation in esophageal cancer patients who underwent esophagectomy. The subjects included 100 patients (87 males and 13 females with mean age 66.5 $\pm$8.6 years) who underwent esophagectomy. They were divided into two groups: 63 patients (53 males and 10 females with mean age 67.4 $\pm$9.0 years) in the preoperative rehabilitation (PR) group and 37 patients (34 males and 3 females with mean age 65.0 $\pm$7.8 years) in the non-PR (NPR) group. The PR group received sufficient preoperative respiratory rehabilitation for >7 days, and the NPR group insufficiently received preoperative respiratory rehabilitation or none at all. The results of the logistic regression analysis and multivariate analysis to correct for all considerable confounding factors revealed the rates of PPCs of 6.4{\%} and 24.3{\%} in the PR group and NPR group, respectively. The PR group demonstrated a significantly less incidence rate of PPCs than the NPR group (odds ratio: 0.14, 95{\%} confidential interval: 0.02\~{}0.64). {$[$}Correction added after online publication 25 June 2012: confidence interval has been changed from -1.86\~{} -0.22{$]$} This study showed that the intensive preoperative respiratory rehabilitation reduced PPCs in esophageal cancer patients who underwent esophagectomy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common and serious complication in elderly patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, with significant adverse outcomes. Successful strategies or therapies to reduce the incidence of delirium are scarce. The objective of this study was to assess the role of prehabilitation in reducing the incidence of delirium in elderly patients. METHODS: A single-center uncontrolled before-and-after study was conducted, including patients aged 70 years or older who underwent elective abdominal surgery for colorectal carcinoma or an abdominal aortic aneurysm between January 2013 and October 2015 (control group) and between November 2015 and June 2018 (prehabilitation group). The prehabilitation group received interventions to improve patients' physical health, nutritional status, factors of frailty and preoperative anaemia prior to surgery. The primary outcome was incidence of delirium, diagnosed with the DSM-V criteria or the confusion assessment method. Secondary outcomes were additional complications, length of stay, unplanned ICU admission, length of ICU stay, readmission rate, institutionalization, and in-hospital or 30-day mortality. RESULT: A total of 360 control patients and 267 prehabilitation patients were included in the final analysis. The mean number of prehabilitation days was 39 days. The prehabilitation group had a higher burden of comorbidities and was more physically and visually impaired at baseline. At adjusted logistic regression analysis, delirium incidence was reduced significantly from 11.7 to 8.2{\%} (OR 0.56; 95{\%} CI 0.32-0.98; P = 0.043). No statistically significant effects were seen on secondary outcomes. CONCLUSION: Current prehabilitation program is feasible and safe, and can reduce delirium incidence in elderly patients undergoing elective major abdominal surgery. This program merits further evaluation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Dutch Trial Registration, NTR5932.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The long-term outcomes of surgery followed by delirium after multimodal prehabilitation program are largely unknown. We conducted this study to assess the effects of prehabilitation on 1-year mortality and of postoperative delirium on 1-year mortality and functional outcomes. METHODS: The subjects of this study were patients aged ≥70 years who underwent elective surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) or colorectal cancer (CRC) between January 2013, and June 2018. A prehabilitation program was implemented in November 2015, which aimed to optimize physical health, nutritional status, factors of frailty and preoperative anemia prior to surgery. The outcomes were assessed as mortality after 6 and 12 months, compared between the two treatment groups; and mortality and functional outcomes, compared between patients with and those without delirium. RESULTS: There were 627 patients (controls N = 360, prehabilitation N = 267) included in this study. Prehabilitation did not reduce mortality after 1 year (HR 1.31 {$[$}95{\%} CI 0.75-2.30{$]$}; p = 0.34). Delirium was significantly associated with 1-year mortality (HR 4.36 {$[$}95{\%} CI 2.45-7.75{$]$}; p < 0.001) and with worse functional outcomes after 6 and 12 months (KATZ ADL p = 0.013 and p = 0.004; TUG test p = 0.041 and p = 0.011, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The prehabilitation program did not reduce 1-year mortality. Delirium and the burden of comorbidity are both independently associated with an increased risk of 1-year mortality and delirium is associated with worse functional outcomes.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Radical cystectomy with lymph-node dissection is a complex procedure and often followed by high postoperative morbidity and physical impairments leading to prolonged length of stay (LOS). Fast-track principles are standard procedure in radical cystectomy. Additional preoperative and postoperative physical exercises and enhanced mobilization may reduce LOS and early complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 107 patients were included in a prospective randomized controlled design, 50 in the intervention group (nI = 50) and 57 in the standard group (ns = 57). The standard regimen comprised regular fast-track principles. The intervention included standardized preoperative and postoperative strength and endurance exercises and progressive postoperative mobilization. The programme was initiated 2 weeks before surgery. Efficacy was expressed as a reduction in postoperative LOS. Early complications were defined as events occurring at most 90 days postoperatively and graded using the Clavien-Dindo classification system. RESULTS: Adherence to prehabilitation, i.e. patients who accomplished at least 75{\%} of the programme, was 59{\%}. Postoperative mobilization was significantly improved by walking distance (p ≤0.001). The ability to perform personal activities of daily living was improved by 1 day (p ≤0.05). The median LOS was 8 days in both treatment groups (p = 0.68). There was no significant difference between treatment groups in severity of complications (p = 0.64). CONCLUSIONS: There was no reduction in LOS due to the preoperative and postoperative rehabilitation programme, although enhanced mobilization was achieved. The optimized minimal surgical procedure may have affected the ability to reduce LOS further with available techniques and procedures. Alternative parameters for recovery may offer more precise and relevant information.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of early intervention for perioperative delirium in older (> 60 years) hip fracture patients. METHODS: This prospective study enrolled hip fracture patients aged >/=60 years who were admitted into our hospital between July 2011 and August 2019. Hip fractures were classified according to the Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteo-synthesefragen (AO) classification. This study included patients with isolated hip fracture and excluded patients with pathological or peri prosthetic fracture or patients with multiple traumatic injuries and high-energy trauma. They were randomized to receive conventional orthopedic care group (n = 65) or comprehensive orthopedic care group including preoperative psychological counseling and preventative risperidone (n = 63). Daily assessment was based on patient interview with the CAM-CR, and delirium was diagnosed by the Delirium Rating Scale (DRS-R-98). The rate, severity and duration of perioperative delirium and the length of postoperative stay were analyzed. RESULTS: Totally 200 patients were screened for eligibility. Twenty patients were excluded due to alcohol abuse and 40 were excluded because of brain lesions on head CT. In addition, 12 patients were excluded because of impaired cognition. Finally 128 patients were enrolled. Their mean age was 75.3 +/- 2.2 years for the comprehensive orthopedic care group and 73.5 +/- 6.1 years for the conventional orthopedic care group, and 53.9{\%} of the patients were female. Sixty-eight (53.1{\%}) patients had intertrochanteric fracture, 39.8{\%} patients had femoral head fracture, and 7.0{\%} patients had subtrochanteric fracture. In addition, 58.6{\%} patients underwent internal fixation and 41.4{\%} patients received arthroplasty. In this study, 63 patients were randomized to the comprehensive orthopedic care group and 65 patients to the conventional orthopedic care group. The two groups were comparable in demographic and baseline characteristics (P > 0.05). The rate of perioperative delirium was significantly lower in the comprehensive care group vs the conventional care group (15.9{\%} vs. 30.8{\%}; P < 0.05). The comprehensive care group had significantly reduced length of postoperative hospital stay vs the conventional care group (11.3 +/- 2.5 days vs. 14.2 +/- 2.2 days, P < 0.01). The mean DRS-R-98 score was 7.1 +/- 2.7 for the comprehensive care group, and was significantly lower than that of the conventional orthopedic care group (11.2 +/- 3.0; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our early intervention may reduce the incidence of perioperative delirium in elderly hip fracture patients (>60 years).},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Poor aerobic fitness is a potential modifiable risk factor for long-term survival and quality of life in patients with lung cancer. This randomized trial evaluates the impact of adding rehabilitation (Rehab) with high-intensity interval training (HIIT) before lung cancer surgery to enhance cardiorespiratory fitness and improve long-term postoperative outcome. METHODS: Patients with operable lung cancer were randomly assigned to usual care (UC, n = 77) or to intervention group (Rehab, n = 74) that entailed HIIT that was implemented only preoperatively. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and pulmonary functional tests (PFTs) including forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume (FEV 1 ) and carbon monoxide transfer factor (KCO) were performed before and 1 year after surgery. RESULTS: During the preoperative waiting time (median 25 days), Rehab patients participated to a median of 8 HIIT sessions (interquartile {$[$}IQ{$]$} 25-75{\%}, 7-10). At 1 year follow-up, 91{\%} UC patients and 93{\%} Rehab patients were still alive ( P = 0.506). Pulmonary functional changes were non-significant and comparable in both groups (FEV 1 mean -7.5{\%}, 95{\%} CI, -3.6 to -12.9 and in KCO mean 5.8{\%} 95{\%} CI 0.8-11.8) Compared with preoperative CPET results, both groups demonstrated similar reduction in peak oxygen uptake (mean -12.2{\%} 95{\%} CI -4.8 to -18.2) and in peak work rate (mean -11.1{\%} 95{\%} CI -4.2 to -17.4). CONCLUSIONS: Short-term preoperative rehabilitation with HIIT does not improve pulmonary function and aerobic capacity measured at 1 year after lung cancer resection.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Radical cystectomy (RC) for the management of muscle-invasive bladder cancer remains a morbid procedure with high rates of perioperative complications. The role of preoperative immunonutritional supplementation (pre-INS) in improving post-RC outcomes is promising and needs further validation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 204 patients who underwent RC for bladder cancer at a single institution, comparing patients who received oral L-arginine-based pre-INS, and those who did not. Preoperative features, postoperative complications, and readmission data were collected. Outcomes of interest included development of high-grade (Clavien-Dindo III-V) complications, readmission within 30 days, ileus, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) requirement, postoperative infection, and length of stay (LOS). Categorical and continuous outcomes were assessed using Fisher's exact test and Welch T-test, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression (MLoR) analysis was used to identify predictive factors for our outcomes. RESULTS: Patients who received pre-INS had significantly lower odds of requiring postoperative TPN (17.3{\%} vs 35.6{\%}; Fisher p=0.015, OR=0.38) and developing postoperative infection (25{\%} vs 45{\%}; Fisher p=0.003; OR=0.41) but no significant difference in the rates of other outcomes. On MLoR, when adjusting for age, gender, body mass index, Charlson comorbidity index, undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy and operative features, pre-INS was a significant predictor of postoperative infection (Fisher p=0.02; OR=0.35) but not for high-grade complications, readmission, ileus, needing TPN or LOS. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative immunonutrition with an L-arginine-based supplement is associated with significant reduction in postoperative infection, one of the most common complications of RC.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is increasingly more prevalent and significant number of patients require knee arthroplasty. Although knee arthroplasty is generally successful, it takes months to recover physical function. Preoperative physical function is known to predict postoperative outcomes and exercise can improve preoperative physical function. However, patients with KOA have difficulty exercise on land due to pain and stiffness, while water exercise can be better tolerated. We hypothesized that preoperative water exercise to improve preoperative physical function will improve postoperative outcomes after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). METHODS: We enrolled 43 participants who were scheduled for elective TKA in 4-8 weeks and scored at or below 50th percentile in mobility assessment tool-sf (MAT-sf). All enrolled participants were assessed on 1) clinical osteoarthritis symptom severity using Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), 2) physical function using Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), 3) self-reported mobility using Mobility Assessment Tool-short form (MAT-sf), 4) depression using Geriatric Depression Scale-short form (GDS-sf), 5) cognitive function using Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Blood samples for high-sensitivity-C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were stored at - 80 $\,^{\circ}$C then all samples were analyzed together. All the enrolled participants were randomly assigned to the aquatic exercise intervention (AEI) or usual care group. Sixty minute sessions of AEI was conducted three times a week for 4-8 weeks. Participants in both groups were evaluated within 1 week before their scheduled surgery, as well as 4 weeks after the surgery. RESULTS: The mean age was 67.1 ($\pm$6.2), 44{\%} were female, 74{\%} were White. There is no statistically significant difference in combined outcome of any complication, unscheduled ER visit, and disposition to nursing home or rehab facility by AEI. However, AEI was associated with more favorable outcomes: WOMAC scores (p < 0.01), chair-stand (p = 0.019), MAT-sf as well as improved depression (p = 0.043) and cognition (p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: 4-8 weeks of aquatic exercise intervention resulted in improved functional outcomes as well as improved depression and cognition in elderly patients undergoing TKA. A larger study is warranted to explore the role of water exercise in clinical and functional outcomes of TKA.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: With increasing global life expectancy, the number of major surgeries performed on aged adults invariably increases. This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a structured prehabilitative program for aged colorectal cancer patients in improving short-term surgical outcomes. METHODS: A prospective philanthropically sponsored Programme for Enhanced Elderly Recovery at Sengkang General Hospital (PEERS) was initiated in February 2017 for patients >/=70-years-old who were due to undergo elective colectomies. These patients were put through a 2- to 4-week-long program before surgery, which included geriatric assessment, nutrition supplementation, and resistance training. They were compared with patients from a similar age group before PEERS was introduced (non-PEERS). RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients, with a median age of 78.5 (70-93) years, were recruited from a single institution to undergo PEERS. Baseline characteristics between the groups were similar. There was no significant improvement of anthropometric and functional characteristics before and after PEERS. Duration of hospitalization was shorter in the PEERS group (9 vs 11 days, P = 0.01). Both groups had similar 30-days' morbidity rates (8.6{\%} vs 17.4{\%}, P = 0.26). The PEERS group had significant improvement in their median EuroQol-5 Dimension score (0.70 presurgery to 0.80 6-months' postsurgery, P = 0.01). After multivariate analysis, the average duration of hospitalization in the PEERS group was 6.8 days shorter (P = 0.018; CI, 1.2-12.4) after adjusting for modality of surgery and complications. This represented a cost saving of USD{\$}11,838.80. CONCLUSION: A standardized prehabilitation program for aged adults reduced the duration of hospitalization, improved the quality of life after surgery, and reduced costs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of a perioperative oral nutritional supplement in malnourished patients who undergo gastrectomy. METHODS: Patients who were determined as being moderately or severely malnourished according to a patient-generated subjective global assessment or who had a body mass index <18.5, were enrolled. The oral nutritional supplement group received 500 mL/d of standard oral nutritional supplement for 2 weeks before gastrectomy and for 4 weeks postoperatively. The primary endpoint was postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo classification >/=II). The secondary endpoints included body weight changes, biochemical parameters, and quality of life survey results. RESULTS: A total of 127 patients (65 in the oral nutritional supplement group and 62 in the control group) were enrolled. The complication rates were not significantly different (29.2{\%} versus 37.1{\%}, P=.346). However, the incidences of overall complications, complications persisting until postoperative week 3 or 5, and severe complications (grade >/=IIIa) were significantly lower in the oral nutritional supplement group for patients with patient-generated subjective global assessment grade C. Total lymphocyte counts were significantly higher in the oral nutritional supplement group at postoperative weeks 3 and 5. For most patients, oral nutritional supplement was well tolerated preoperatively. However, only 26.2{\%} and 50.8{\%} of the patients in the oral nutritional supplement group could consume >250 mL/d of oral nutritional supplement postoperatively during the 2nd and 4th weeks, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The routine application of perioperative oral nutritional supplement is not recommended for malnourished patients receiving gastrectomy. However, perioperative standard oral nutritional supplement administration may reduce the incidence, severity, and duration of complications after gastrectomy in severely malnourished patients (patient-generated subjective global assessment grade C).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common complication in elderly hospitalized patients. It prolongs the length of hospital stay, raises costs, increases the workload of the nursing staff, and may necessitate transfer of the patient to a nursing home. The risk of postoperative delirium is particularly high in elderly patients with pre-existing cognitive deficits. METHODS: In an open study, we systematically assessed the frequency of postoperative delirium in patients over age 70 on two surgical wards of a general hospital. In a six-month "prevalence phase," from March to August 2011, we counted the number of patients with postoperative delirium, but did not initiate any intervention. Thereafter, in a ten-month "intervention phase" from September 2011 to June 2012, a nurse with special training in the management of delirium carried out an intervention involving component measures of the Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP) on one of the two wards, with the aim of preventing postoperative delirium. The patients on the other ward served as a control group. RESULTS: In the prevalence phase, 20.2{\%} of all patients developed postoperative delirium (95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$}, 14.6-26.4). In the intervention phase, postoperative delirium arose in 20.8{\%} (95{\%} CI, 11.3-32.1) of the patients on the ward with no specific interventions, but in only 4.9{\%} (95{\%} CI, 0.0-11.5) of those on the ward where the intervention was carried out. The difference was presumably due to the measures initiated by the specially trained nurse, including validation, improvement of sleep, cognitive activation, early mobilization, improved sensory stimulation, and improved nutritional and fluid intake. Important predictors of postoperative delirium included a low score on the Mini-Mental State Examination, advanced age, and preoperative infection. CONCLUSION: The frequency of postoperative delirium in elderly patients with cognitive deficits can be lowered with nursing measures carried out by a specially trained nurse, close postoperative supervision, and cognitive activation.},

	abstract = {Background: Severe and early quadriceps weakness (QW) after total knee arthroplasty (TKA), which is caused by acute inflammation resulting from surgical trauma and tourniquet-induced ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury, can be especially problematic. We focused on tourniquet-induced IR injury, because it has been shown to be preventable through ischemic and exercise preconditioning. Low-intensity resistance exercise with slow movement and tonic force generation (LST) share some similarities with ischemic and exercise preconditioning. The present study primarily aimed to clarify the efficacy of preoperative LST program as prehabilitation for early QW among patients with TKA using propensity score matching analysis. Methods: This single-center retrospective observational study used data from patients with knee osteoarthritis (n = 277) who were scheduled to undergo unilateral TKA between August 2015 and January 2017. Those with missing outcome data due to their inability to perform tests were excluded. The LST group included participants who performed LST and aerobic exercise (LST session) more than seven times for three months prior to surgery. The control group included participants who performed less than eight LST sessions, a general and light exercise or had no exercise for three months prior to surgery. Knee circumference, thigh volume, knee pain during quadriceps strength test (QST) and timed up and go test (TUG), quadriceps strength, and TUG were measured before and 4 days after surgery. Knee swelling, thigh swelling, Δknee pain, QW, and ΔTUG were determined by comparing pre- and postoperative measurements. Results: Propensity score matching generated 41 matched pairs who had nearly balanced characteristics. The LST group had a significantly lower knee and thigh swelling, QW, and ΔTUG compared to the control group (all, p < 0.05). No significant differences in Δknee pain during the QST and TUG were observed between both groups (both, p > 0.05). Conclusions: The present study demonstrated the beneficial effects of preoperative LST program on knee swelling, thigh swelling, QW, and walking disability immediately after TKA.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Surgeries for cancer of the esophagus are still associated with a high rate of postoperative morbidity. There are few reports of perioperative nutritional support for patients undergoing esophageal cancer surgery, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine use of immunonutrition in these patients. The aim of this study was to determine whether preoperative immunonutrition positively influences key clinical outcomes such as postoperative infectious complications, mortality, length of hospital stay, and short-term survival in this population. DESIGN AND SETTING: We undertook a retrospective investigation of the effects of preoperative nutritional support on the postoperative course of esophageal cancer surgery at the Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, International University of Health and Welfare Mita Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-five patients who underwent esophagectomy for esophageal cancer were included in this study. Of the 55 patients, 26 patients consumed a liquid dietary supplement (IMPACT group) before surgery and 29 patients did not (STANDARD group). INTERVENTION: Before surgery, the IMPACT group consumed 750 ml (3 packs)/day of Impact for 5 consecutive days. MEASUREMENTS: The analysis was based on postoperative complications, hospital mortality, length of hospital stay, and short-term survival. RESULTS: Significantly fewer patients developed postoperative infections in the IMPACT group compared with the STANDARD group (p=.007): 4 of 21 patients in the IMPACT group and 10 of 29 patients in the STANDARD group. Either an infectious complication or another complication developed in 8 patients in the IMPACT group and 13 patients in the STANDARD group, with the result that 6 patients in the STANDARD group died of postoperative complications (p=.001). The duration of hospitalization was 34 days in the IMPACT group and 48 days in the STANDARD group; hence, hospitalization was significantly shorter in patients treated with Impact (p=.008). The mean 6-month survival rates for the IMPACT group and the STANDARD group were 92{\%} (24/26) and 72{\%} (21/29), respectively (p=.028). CONCLUSION: Simple preoperative supplementation significantly improved outcome. Administration of the supplemental diet before esophageal surgery appeared to be an effective strategy in reducing infectious complications, mortality, and hospitalization, and improving short-term survival.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: As a newly developed treatment, preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) has been studied in depth. However, few studies have assessed the relationship between advanced age and a shorter term intensive pattern of preoperative PR in patients with lung cancer (LC) and especially those patients waiting for therapeutic LC surgeries. This study investigated short-term preoperative PR combined with inspiratory muscle training (IMT) and aerobic endurance training in elderly patients scheduled to undergo LC lobectomy. METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled trial with a total of 60 subjects aged ≥70 y was conducted. The intervention group (PR group) was treated for 1 wk with systematic and highly intensive preoperative PR training before lobectomy, and the control group (NPR group) was treated with conventional preoperative respiratory management. We analyzed the 6-min walking distance (6-MWD), the peak expiratory flow (PEF), and quality-of-life scores before and after the rehabilitation regimen as well as the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs). RESULTS: In total, 30 patients (PR group) completely executed the 7-d intensive preoperative PR, and 30 patients (NPR group) served as the control group. The two groups were comparable at baseline. During the preoperative PR, a significantly longer 6-MWD (increase: 28.6 $\pm$18.2 versus 9.4 $\pm$27.0 m; between-groups difference: 19.2 m, P = 0.029) and an increased PEF (increase: 26.2 $\pm$22.5 versus 8.2 $\pm$10.3 L/min; between-groups difference: 18.0 L/min, P < 0.001) were noted in the PR group compared with the NPR group. After LC surgery, the mean postoperative length of stay (6.9 $\pm$4.4 versus 10.7 $\pm$6.4 d, P = 0.010) and total hospital stay (16.0 $\pm$4.5 versus 19.7 $\pm$6.5 d, P = 0.012) were significantly reduced in the PR group. Thirty-day PPCs were noted in four (13.3{\%}) patients in the PR group and 11 (36.7{\%}) patients in the NPR group, with a significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS: For elderly LC patients scheduled to undergo surgery in China, a 7-d intensive pattern of preoperative PR combined with IMT and aerobic endurance training may be a feasible rehabilitation strategy with positive physical and psychological effects.},

	abstract = {Many patients with lung cancer undergo surgery, which can increase the risk for muscle loss, leading to worsened outcomes. A multimodal prehabilitation intervention integrating dietary and muscle assessment may help clinicians better understand changes in these outcomes. This pilot assessed feasibility of multimodal prehabilitation in early-stage surgical lung cancer patients and explored relationships between body composition, muscle characteristics and dietary intake, as well as muscle changes due to prehabilitation. Patients were randomized to 1 of 2 groups: multimodal prehabilitation including nutritional supplements (fish oil with vitamin D3 + whey protein with leucine), exercise and relaxation, or standard of care. Physical function, dietary intake and muscle were evaluated at 0 and 4 weeks pre-operatively. Of 87 patients assessed for eligibility, 34 (39{\%}) were randomized and 3 (9{\%}) were lost to follow-up. Median age was 69 years and baseline protein intake was 1.0 g/kg/day. Adherence to exercise (86{\%}) and supplements was high (93{\%}); 3 patients (16{\%}) reported side effects. Supplements significantly increased protein, omega-3 fatty acid, leucine and vitamin D intake. There were no significant changes in muscle characteristics. Multimodal prehabilitation with dietary and muscle analyses proved to be feasible. An adequately powered randomized controlled trial is warranted. ClinicalTrials.gov registration no: NCT04610606. Novelty: Multimodal prehabilitation incorporating dietary assessment and muscle analysis is feasible for early-stage surgical lung cancer patients. An adequately powered randomized controlled trial is warranted to further explore functional and post-operative outcomes.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the impact of preoperative immunonutrition on the outcomes of colon cancer surgery. BACKGROUND: Although current guidelines recommend that immunonutrition should be prescribed for malnourished patients before major gastrointestinal surgery, the benefit of preoperative immunonutrition remains debatable. METHODS: Between April 2019 and October 2020, 176 patients with primary colon cancer were enrolled and randomly assigned (1:1) to receive preoperative immunonutrition plus a normal diet (n = 88) or a normal diet alone (n = 88). Patients in the immunonutrition group received oral nutritional supplementation (400 mL/day) with arginine and omega-3 fatty acids for 7 days before elective surgery. The primary endpoint was the rate of infectious complications, and the secondary endpoints were the postoperative complication rate, change in body weight, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: The rates of infectious (17.7{\%} vs. 15.9{\%}, P = 0.751) and total (31.6{\%} vs. 29.3{\%}, P = 0.743) complications were not different between the two groups. Old age was the only significant predictive factor for the occurrence of infectious complications (odds ratio = 2.990, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.179-7.586, P = 0.021). The length of hospital stay (7.6 +/- 2.5 vs. 7.4 +/- 2.3 days, P = 0.635) and overall change in body weight (P = 0.379) were similar between the two groups. However, only the immunonutrition group showed weight recovery after discharge (+0.4 +/- 2.1 vs. -0.7 +/- 2.3 kg, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative immunonutrition was not associated with infectious complications in patients undergoing colon cancer surgery. Routine administration of immunonutrition prior to colon cancer surgery cannot be justified.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing colorectal cancer resections are at risk for delayed recovery. Prehabilitation aims to enhance functional capacity preoperatively for better toleration of surgery and to facilitate recovery. The authors previously demonstrated the limited impact of a prehabilitation program using exercise alone. They propose an expanded trimodal prehabilitation program that adds nutritional counseling, protein supplementation, and anxiety reduction to a moderate exercise program. This study aimed to estimate the impact of this trimodal program on the recovery of functional capacity compared with standard surgical care. METHODS: Consecutive patients were enrolled in this pre- and postintervention study over a 23-month period. The postoperative recovery for 42 consecutive patients enrolled in the prehabilitation program was compared with that of 45 patients assessed before the intervention began. The primary outcome was functional walking capacity (6-min walk test {$[$}6MWT{$]$}). The secondary outcomes included self-reported physical activity (CHAMPS questionnaire) and health-related quality of life (SF-36). Data are expressed as mean $\pm$standard deviation or median (interquartile range {$[$}IQR{$]$}) and were analyzed using Chi-square and Student's t test. All p values lower than 0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: The prehabilitation and control groups were comparable in terms of age, gender, body mass index (BMI) and American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) class. There was no difference in walking capacity at the first assessment (6MWT distance, 422 $\pm$87 vs 402 $\pm$57 m; p = 0.21). During the prehabilitation period lasting a median of 33 days (range, 21-46 days), functional walking capacity improved by 40 $\pm$40 m (p < 0.01). The postoperative complication rates and the hospital length of stay were similar. The patients in the prehabilitation program had better postoperative walking capacity at both 4 weeks (mean difference, 51.5 $\pm$93 m; p = 0.01) and 8 weeks (mean difference, 84.5 $\pm$83 m; p < 0.01). At 8 weeks, 81 {\%} of the prehabilitated patients were recovered compared with 40 {\%} of the control group (p < 0.01). The prehabilitation group also reported higher levels of physical activity before and after surgery. CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, a 1-month trimodal prehabilitation program improved postoperative functional recovery. A randomized trial is ongoing (NCT01356264).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) has become one of the most prevalent joint diseases worldwide, leading to a growing burden of pain and disability as populations age. Although there is consistent evidence to support postoperative rehabilitation and high-intensity prehabilitation for total knee arthroplasty (TKA), the clinical outcomes of hospital-based prehabilitation remain unclear. We aimed to evaluate the effect of a hospital-based prehabilitation program on knee score (KS), function score (FS), and length of stay (LOS) among patients with knee OA after TKA. METHODS: A retrospective comparative study was conducted at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University among patients with primary knee OA. Seventy-two postopearative patients who did not undergo the prehabilitation program were included as the control group, while 68 postoperative patients who underwent the prehabilitation program were assigned to the intervention group. All patients went through the same care after TKA. The KS, FS, and pain levels were measured 5 days before surgery, immediately preceding surgery, immediately after the surgery, and at 1 week and 1 month postoperatively. LOS for each patient was recorded. RESULTS: The new prehabilitation training program significantly improved the KS over time in the intervention group. However, no significant between-group difference was identified in the change of FS. The prehabilitation program also provided shorter LOS. CONCLUSIONS: The hospital-based prehabilitation program leads to improved recovery, as indicated by higher KS postoperatively, which may result in improved clinical outcomes of TKA.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Impairment in aerobic fitness is a potential modifiable risk factor for postoperative complications. In this randomized controlled trial, we hypothesized that a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) program enhances cardiorespiratory fitness before lung cancer surgery and therefore reduces the risk of postoperative complications. METHODS: Patients with operable lung cancer were randomly assigned to usual care (UC) (n = 77) or preoperative rehabilitation based on HIIT (Rehab) (n = 74). Maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing and the 6-minute walk test were performed twice before surgery. The primary outcome measure was a composite of death and in-hospital postoperative complications. RESULTS: The groups were well balanced in terms of patient characteristics. During the preoperative waiting period (median 25 days), the peak oxygen consumption and the 6-minute walking distance increased (median +15{\%}, interquartile range, 25th to 75 percentile {$[$}IQR25{\%}-75{\%}, {\%}{$]$} = +9{\%} to +22{\%}, p = 0.003 and +15{\%}, IQR25{\%}-75{\%} = +8{\%} to +28{\%}, p < 0.001, respectively) in the Rehab group, whereas peak oxygen consumption declined in the UC group (median -8{\%}, IQR25{\%}-75{\%} = -16{\%} to 0{\%}{$]$}, p = 0.005). The primary end point did not differ significantly between the two groups: at least one postoperative complication developed in 27 of the 74 patients (35.5{\%}) in the Rehab group and 39 of 77 patients (50.6{\%}) in the UC group (p = 0.080). Notably, the incidence of pulmonary complications was lower in the Rehab compared with in the UC group (23{\%} versus 44{\%}, p = 0.018), owing to a significant reduction in atelectasis (12.2{\%} versus 36.4{\%}, p < 0.001), and this decrease was accompanied by a shorter length of stay in the postanesthesia care unit (median -7 hours, IQR25{\%}-75{\%} = -4 to -10). CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized controlled trial, preoperative HIIT resulted in significant improvement in aerobic performances but failed to reduce early complications after lung cancer resection.},

	abstract = {AIM: There is evidence that preoperative carbohydrate drinks and postoperative nutritional supplements improve the outcome of colorectal surgery. There is little information on their individual contribution. METHOD: A prospective four-arm double-blind controlled trial was carried out in which patients were randomized to carbohydrate or placebo drinks preoperatively and a polymeric supplement or placebo drink postoperatively. The primary outcome was insulin resistance (using the short insulin tolerance test and HOMA-IR). Secondary outcomes included handgrip strength, pulmonary function, intestinal permeability and postoperative complications. RESULTS: A total of 120 patients were randomized to four demographically well matched groups. Patients who received preoperative and postoperative supplements had better glucose homeostasis (P = 0.004), peak expiratory flow rate (P = 0.035), handgrip strength (P = 0.002) and less insulin resistance (P = 0.001) compared with those who only received placebo drinks. CONCLUSION: Oral nutritional supplements given preoperatively and postoperatively improve postoperative handgrip strength, pulmonary function and insulin resistance. A weaker effect was seen in patients who received supplements either preoperatively or postoperatively. Oral nutritional supplements should be given both preoperatively and postoperatively.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of dietician-delivered intensive nutritional support (INS) on postoperative outcome in patients with esophageal cancer. Approximately 50-80{\%} of patients with esophageal cancer are malnourished at the time of diagnosis. Malnutrition enhances the risk of postoperative complications, resulting in delay of postoperative recovery and impairment of quality of life. Sixty-five patients with esophageal cancer were included. All patients who received surgery (n = 28) in the time frame between March 2009 and April 2010, the first year after the start of INS, were included in the INS intervention group. The control group (n = 37) consisted of patients who received surgery during the 3 years before the start of INS. Logistic regression analysis was used to compare differences in severity of postoperative complications using the Dindo classification. Linear regression was applied to evaluate differences in preoperative weight change. The adjusted odds ratio for developing serious complications after surgery of INS compared with the control group was 0.23 (95{\%} confidence interval: 0.053-0.97; P = 0.045). Benefit was mainly observed in patients who received neoadjuvant therapy before esophagectomy (n = 35). The INS program furthermore resulted in a relative preoperative weight gain in comparison with the control group of +4.8{\%} (P = 0.009, adjusted) in these neoadjuvant-treated patients. This study shows that dietician-delivered INS preserves preoperative weight and decreases severe postoperative complications in patients with esophageal cancer.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surgery remains the first curative treatment for colorectal cancer. Prehabilitation seems to attenuate the loss of lean mass in the early postoperative period. However, its long-term role has not been studied. Lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic has forced to carry out the prehabilitation program at home. This study aimed to assess the effect of home prehabilitation on body composition, complications, and hospital stay in patients undergoing oncological colorectal surgery. METHODS: A prospective and randomized clinical study was conducted in 20 patients operated of colorectal cancer during COVID-19 lockdown (13 March to 21 June 2020) in a single university clinical hospital. Patients were randomized into two study groups (10 per group): prehabilitation vs standard care. Changes in lean mass and fat mass at 45 and 90 days after surgery were measured using multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis. RESULTS: Prehabilitation managed to reduce hospital stay (4.8 vs 7.2 days, p = 0.052) and postoperative complications (20{\%} vs 50{\%}, p = 0.16). Forty-five days after surgery, the loss of lean mass decreased (1.7{\%} vs 7.1{\%}, p = 0.17). These differences in lean mass were attenuated at 90 days; however, the standard care group increased considerably their fat mass compared to the prehabilitation group (+ 8.72{\%} vs - 8.16{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: Home prehabilitation has proven its effectiveness, achieving an attenuation of lean mass loss in the early postoperative period and a lower gain in fat mass in the late postoperative period. In addition, it has managed to reduce hospital stays and postoperative complications.

	abstract = {Background: Perioperative enteral nutrition (EN) enriched with immune-modulating substrates is preferable for patients undergoing major abdominal cancer surgery. In this study, perioperative EN enriched with immune-modulating nutrients such as arginine, glutamine, and omega-3 fatty acids was evaluated for its anti-inflammatory efficacy in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma or gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) receiving curative surgery. Materials and Methods: This prospective, randomized, double-blind study recruited 34 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma or gastric GIST undergoing elective curative surgery. These patients were randomly assigned to the study group, receiving immune-modulating nutrient-enriched EN, or the control group, receiving standard EN from 3 days before surgery (preoperative day 3) to up to postoperative day 14 or discharge. Laboratory and inflammatory parameters were assessed on preoperative day 3 and postoperative day 14 or at discharge. Adverse events (AEs) and clinical outcomes were documented daily and compared between groups. Results: No significant differences were observed between the two groups in selected laboratory and inflammatory parameters, or in their net change, before and after treatment. AEs and clinical outcomes, including infectious complications, overall complications, time to first bowel action, and length of hospital stay after surgery, were comparable between treatment groups (all P > 0.05). Conclusion: Immune-modulating nutrient-enriched EN had no prominent immunomodulation effect compared with that of standard EN.},

	abstract = {It has been suggested that the routine provision of oral dietary supplements (ODS) in postoperative surgical patients is of benefit in terms of morbidity and length of hospital stay. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of both pre- and postoperative ODS in patients undergoing an elective laparotomy. Patients requiring elective major gastrointestinal surgery were prospectively randomized into one of four groups: Group I received ODS in addition to normal diet both pre- and postoperatively, Group II were given ODS in the preoperative period only, Group III received ODS only in the postoperative period, and Group IV did not receive any supplements. Assessments of nutritional status, voluntary food intake, weight loss, serum albumin, morbidity and mortality, anxiety and depression, and postoperative activity levels were performed, and comparisons made between the groups. One hundred patients were included in the study. The mean daily energy intake from preoperative ODS was 507 +/- 140 kcal, significantly more than the 252 +/- 195 kcal in the postoperative period (P < 0.001). The postoperative voluntary food intake in patients receiving ODS was not significantly different from that in patients receiving normal diet alone (1090 versus 1268 kcal, 46.2 versus 49.1 g protein, P > 0. 05). All groups demonstrated an overall weight loss, with no significant differences between the groups, and there was no demonstrable effect on clinical outcome. At 6 mo postoperatively there were no differences between the study groups in terms of levels of activity. These results suggest that the routine use of perioperative ODS in well-nourished patients undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery confers no clinical or functional benefit.},

This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a preoperative exercise-based intervention program compared with usual care on the improvement of clinical status, physical capacities and postoperative recovery of patients awaiting surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis. Sixty-eight participants were randomised to receive either a 6-week supervised exercise-based prehabilitation program or hospital usual care. The outcomes included both clinical and physical measures. Data collection occurred at post-intervention, and 6 weeks, 3- and 6-months post-surgery. Significant but small improvements were found in favour of the experimental group at the post-intervention assessment for pain intensity, lumbar spinal stenosis-related disability, lumbar strength in flexion, low back extensor muscles endurance, total ambulation time, and sit to stand performance. A significant difference in favor of the intervention group was found starting at the 3-month postoperative follow-up for low back-related disability. No adverse events were reported. Exercise-based prehabilitation did not improve short-term postoperative recovery in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Improved preoperative immunonutrition has been shown to decrease the length of stay (LOS) and complications among patients undergoing elective gastrointestinal cancer surgeries. The purpose of this study was to determine whether preoperative immunonutrition supplementation decreases postoperative LOS, infectious complications, and morbidity in patients undergoing irreversible electroporation (IRE) surgery for locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). METHODS: At a regional hepatopancreatobiliary referral center within an academic medical center 71 patients receiving IRE treatment of LAPC were included in the study. The participants were divided into those receiving preoperative immunonutrition (n = 44) and those receiving no supplemental preoperative immunonutrition (n = 27). Main outcomes and measures were LOS, postoperative complications, nutritional risk index (NRI), and albumin levels. RESULTS: Patients in both groups were similar for preoperative nutrition parameters and operative therapy. Patients in the immunonutrition group experienced a statistically significant decrease in postoperative complications (p = 0.05) and LOS (10.7 vs. 17.4, p = 0.01), and less of a decrease in nutritional risk index (-12.6 vs. -16.2, p = 0.03) and albumin levels (-1.1 vs. -1.5, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Preoperative immunonutrition was clinically significant in decreasing postoperative complications, LOS, and improving post-surgery NRI and albumin levels in patients receiving elective IRE treatment of non-resectable pancreatic cancer. These results indicate that preoperative immunonutrition is effective and feasible in this subset of cancer patients.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Preoperative range of motion (ROM) is the most important variable to determine final flexion after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The purpose of this study was to determine whether a preoperative home exercise program could improve ROM in the arthritic knee and whether this influenced ROM and functional recovery following primary TKA. METHODS: During the period between 2005 and 2006, one hundred and twenty-two patients with gonarthrosis were included in a prospective study and randomly allocated to either the control or the treatment group. The sixty-one subjects in the treatment group underwent a 6-week home-based exercise program before TKA surgery. All one hundred and twenty-two patients were assessed before and after this exercise intervention. Postoperative assessments were at 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year. Each evaluation included knee ROM and the Knee Society Clinical Rating System. Length of hospital stay and postoperative duration before achieving 90$\,^{\circ}$of knee flexion were also recorded. RESULTS: Exercise program improves knee motion in the presence of gonarthrosis. After TKA, the patients in the exercise group achieved 90$\,^{\circ}$of knee flexion faster and had a shorter hospital stay. There is no prolonged effect on knee motion or patient function between 6 weeks and 1 year postoperatively. CONCLUSION: Preoperative exercise of the arthritic knee facilitates immediate postoperative recovery following primary TKA. LEVELS OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic study, Level I.},

@article{2926,
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Certain surgical interventions, especially those involving upper GI tract remain challenging, due to high morbidity and mortality rates. The study of frailty in the surgical population has allowed the identification of those patients with a higher risk of poor postoperative outcomes. There remains a lack of evidence regarding the possibility of improving these results through a preoperative holistic management of the patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether preoperative treatment, in carefully selected patients, can improve the outcome following surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between March 2015 and February 2016 patients affected by malignant tumors of the upper GI tract were enrolled at our Institution for major oncologic surgery. Amongst them, frail patients (Group 1) were identified using a validated scoring system and underwent a multidisciplinary preoperative management plan, composed of nutritional intervention, physical/respiratory enhancement and optimization of ongoing therapy. Short-term postoperative outcomes were then compared with a control group (Group 2) of patients with comparable frailty features and surgical indications, who had undergone surgery in the period from March 2013 to February 2014. RESULTS: 30-days and 3-months mortality, overall and severe complication rates were found to be significantly lower (p < 0.05) in Group 1 (41 patients) when compared with Group 2 (35 patents). No significant differences were recorded for the following outcomes: length of stay, referral to post-discharge institutionalisation and hospital re-admission. DISCUSSION: This study confirms advantages provided by preoperative treatment in frail patients, suggesting a new pathway for the improvement of postoperative outcomes.},

Thirty-five patients awaiting primary total hip arthroplasty were recruited into this study and randomly allocated before admission to receive either the standard pathway of care or the rehabilitation program and booklet. All patients showed increases in function and psychological variables with time. The preoperative class and booklet, however, seemed to have the greatest impact on length of hospital stay, reducing the hospital stay by 3 days, and therapy input required, significantly influencing the cost of the procedure (the rehabilitation class led to a cost saving of 587 British pounds; approximately 810 dollars, per patient). In addition, patients attending the class reported higher levels of satisfaction (99{\%} satisfied in the preoperative rehabilitation class compared with 80{\%} in the control group 3 months postoperatively) and had more realistic expectations of surgery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frailty is a state of vulnerability as a result of decreased reserves. Prehabilitation may increase reserve and improve postoperative outcomes. Our objective was to determine if home-based prehabilitation improves postoperative functional recovery in older adults with frailty having cancer surgery. METHODS: This double blind randomised trial enrolled people >/=60 yr having elective cancer surgery and >/=3 weeks from enrolment to surgery as eligible. Participation in a remotely supported, home-based exercise prehabilitation program plus nutritional guidance was compared with standard care plus written advice on age-appropriate activity and nutrition. The primary outcome was 6-min walk test (6MWT) distance at the first postoperative clinic visit. Secondary outcomes included physical performance, quality of life, disability, length of stay, non-home discharge, and 30-day readmission. RESULTS: Of 543 patients assessed, 254 were eligible and 204 (80{\%}) were randomised (102 per arm); 182 (94 intervention and 88 control) had surgery and were analysed. Mean age was 74 yr and 57{\%} were female. Mean duration of participation was 5 weeks, mean adherence was 61{\%} (range 0{\%}-100{\%}). We found no significant difference in 6MWT at follow-up (+14 m, 95{\%} confidence interval -26-55 m, P=0.486), or for secondary outcomes. Analyses using a prespecified adherence definition of >/=80{\%} supported improvements in 6MWT distance, complication count, and disability. CONCLUSIONS: A home-based prehabilitation program did not significantly improve postoperative recovery or other outcomes in older adults with frailty having cancer surgery. Program adherence may be a key mediator of prehabilitation efficacy. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02934230.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In patients with bladder cancer, poor functional status has remarkable deleterious effects on postoperative outcome and prognosis. Conditioning intervention initiated before surgery has the potential to reduce functional decline attributable to surgery. Nonetheless, evidence is lacking in patients undergoing radical cystectomy. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a preoperative multimodal intervention (prehabilitation) is feasible and effective in radical cystectomy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study, conducted at an academic tertiary health care institution, enrolled adult patients scheduled for radical cystectomy. From August 2013 to October 2017, 70 patients were randomized: 35 to multimodal prehabilitation (prehab group) and 35 to standard care (control group). INTERVENTION: Multimodal prehabilitation was a preoperative conditioning intervention including aerobic and resistance exercise, diet therapy, and relaxation techniques. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Primary outcome was perioperative change in functional capacity, measured with the distance covered during a 6-min walk test (6MWD), assessed at baseline, before surgery, and at 4 and 8 wk after surgery. Data were compared using robust mixed linear models for repeated measures. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Preoperative change in 6MWD compared with baseline was not significantly different between groups (prehab group 40.8 {$[$}114.0{$]$} m vs control group 9.7 (108.4) m, p=0.250). However, at 4 wk after surgery, a significant difference in functional capacity was detected (6MWD, prehab group -15.4 {$[$}142.5{$]$} m vs control group -97.9 {$[$}123.8{$]$} m, p=0.014). No intervention-related adverse effects were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Data suggested that multimodal prehabilitation resulted in faster functional recovery after radical cystectomy. PATIENT SUMMARY: After major cancer surgery, people usually feel week and tired, and have less energy to perform activities of daily living. In this study, we showed that using the time before surgery to promote exercise and good nutrition could fasten recovery after the surgical removal of the bladder.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Preserving functional capacity is a key element in the care continuum for patients with esophagogastric cancer. Prehabilitation, a preoperative conditioning intervention aiming to optimize physical status, has not been tested in upper gastrointestinal surgery to date. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether prehabilitation is effective in improving functional status in patients undergoing esophagogastric cancer resection. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized clinical trial (available-case analysis based on completed assessments) was conducted at McGill University Health Centre (Montreal, Quebec, Canada) comparing prehabilitation with a control group. Intervention consisted of preoperative exercise and nutrition optimization. Participants were adults awaiting elective esophagogastric resection for cancer. The study dates were February 13, 2013, to February 10, 2017. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was change in functional capacity, measured with absolute change in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD). Preoperative (end of the prehabilitation period) and postoperative (from 4 to 8 weeks after surgery) data were compared between groups. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients were randomized, and 51 were included in the primary analysis. The control group were a mean (SD) age, 68.0 (11.6) years and 20 (80{\%}) men. Patients in the prehabilitation group were a mean (SD) age, 67.3 (7.4) years and 18 (69{\%}) men. Compared with the control group, the prehabilitation group had improved functional capacity both before surgery (mean {$[$}SD{$]$} 6MWD change, 36.9 {$[$}51.4{$]$} vs -22.8 {$[$}52.5{$]$} m; P < .001) and after surgery (mean {$[$}SD{$]$} 6MWD change, 15.4 {$[$}65.6{$]$} vs -81.8 {$[$}87.0{$]$} m; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Prehabilitation improves perioperative functional capacity in esophagogastric surgery. Keeping patients from physical and nutritional status decline could have a significant effect on the cancer care continuum. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01666158.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: A trimodal prehabilitation protocol was designed with the aim to evaluate whether it contributes to reducing postoperative morbidity, to evaluate the effect of prehabilitation on overall hospital stay, and to analyze the evolution of functional capacity before and after surgery. METHODS: A single-center observational study of patients with colorectal cancer who underwent surgery with curative intent after a trimodal prehabilitation protocol. We collected data for postoperative morbidity according to the Comprehensive Complication Index and hospital stay, which were compared with a historical matrix. Functional capacity data were also collected before and after the application of the prehabilitation protocol. RESULTS: Compared to the historical population, the overall Comprehensive Complication Index was reduced from 13.2 to 11.5, which was statistically significant. Analyzed by morbidity type, all decreased in percentage, although without achieving significance (surgical site infection from 11.7{\%} to 8.4{\%}, nosocomial infection 15.8 to 10{\%} and medical morbidity 8.6{\%} to 4.2{\%}). The overall hospital stay went from 6 to 4 days, and the decrease in the percentage of patients who prepared at home was statistically significant in both cases. CONCLUSIONS: Trimodal prehabilitation can contribute to lowering the postoperative morbidity and overall hospital stay of patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prehabilitation has been shown to improve postoperative outcomes in a variety of patient populations undergoing major operations. The feasibility, generalizability, and value of broad implementation of prehabilitation outside the research environment are unknown. METHODS: Medicare claims data from 2014 to 2017 were used to conduct a multicenter (21 Michigan hospitals) pragmatic cohort study. Patients and controls were followed for the duration of their index surgical hospitalization and for 90 days postoperatively. Medicare beneficiaries older than 18 years who underwent inpatient surgical procedures at a participating hospital during the study time period were eligible for inclusion. The prehabilitation program involved a home-based walking program with supplementary education on nutrition, smoking cessation, and psychological preparation for surgical procedure. Data were analyzed with an intention-to-treat approach using t-tests and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Propensity score matching used comorbidities and demographic factors to match controls to patients in a 2:1 manner with an exact match required for operation type. RESULTS: Patients (n = 523) and controls (n = 1,046) had no significant differences in demographic factors or comorbidities. Patients had significantly shorter median hospital length of stay (6 vs 7 days; p < 0.01) than controls and were more likely to be discharged to home (65.6{\%} vs 57.0{\%}, p < 0.01). Total episode payments were significantly lower for patients compared with controls ({\$}31,641 vs {\$}34,837; p = 0.04). Patients had significantly lower post-acute care payments for skilled nursing facility ({\$}941 vs {\$}1,566; p = 0.02) and home health ({\$}829 vs {\$}960; p = 0.03) services. CONCLUSIONS: Participation in a prehabilitation program in Michigan was associated with shorter length of stay and lower total episode payments after operation. Payers and hospitals should invest in the implementation of simple home-based prehabilitation programs.},

	abstract = {Patients who suffer from cancer are at a higher risk of complications when they experience malnutrition. Evidence shows that oral nutritional supplements favor the healing process. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of preoperative oral nutritional intervention in oncological patients undergoing surgery. This study assessed retrospectively 55 cancer patients who previously had undergone abdominal surgery and did not have receive pre-surgical nutritional support (control group), and prospectively 30 oncological patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery and received pre-surgical high-protein nutritional support (experimental group). All patients had to have a NRS 2002 score >/= 3. Analytical and clinical parameters were analyzed and the NRS 2002 screening test was performed. Post-operative assessments of surgical wound complications were also carried out to determine the impact of nutrition support. Pre-surgical nutritional interventions reduced the incidence and severity of wound complications as well as the length of hospital stays. Only 26.7{\%} of patients in the experimental group had complications compared to 60{\%} of the control group (P = 0.003). We conclude that pre-surgical nutritional interventions of patients undergoing surgery can improve post-surgical patient outcomes of malnourished patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The impact of prehabilitation on physical fitness and postoperative course after hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) surgeries for malignancy is unknown. The current study aimed to investigate the effect of preoperative exercise and nutritional therapies on nutritional status, physical fitness, and postoperative outcomes of patients undergoing an invasive HPB surgery for malignancy. METHODS: Patients who underwent open abdominal surgeries for HPB malignancies (major hepatectomy, pancreatoduodenectomy, or hepato-pancreatoduodenectomy) between 2016 and 2017 were subjected to prehabilitation. Patients before the introduction of prehabilitation were included as historical control subjects for 1:1 propensity score-matching (no-prehabilitation group). The preoperative nutritional status and postoperative course were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The prehabilitation group consisted of 76 patients scheduled to undergo HPB surgeries for malignancy. An identical number of patients were selected as the no-prehabilitation group after propensity score-matching. During the waiting period, serum albumin levels were significantly deteriorated in the no-prehabilitation group, whereas this index did not deteriorate or even improved in the prehabilitation group. By performing prehabilitation, a 6-min walk distance and total muscle/fat ratio were significantly increased during the waiting period. Although the overall incidence of postoperative complications did not differ between the two groups, the postoperative hospital stay was shorter in the prehabilitation group than in the no-prehabilitation group (median, 23 vs 30 days; p = 0.045). CONCLUSION: The introduction of prehabilitation prevented nutritional deterioration, improved physical fitness before surgery, and shortened the postoperative hospital stay for the patients undergoing HPB surgeries for malignancy.},

Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective, open-label randomized clinical trial recruited participants 50 to 85 years of age with knee osteoarthritis according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria for whom a TKR was scheduled at 3 French tertiary care centers. Recruitment started on October 4, 2012, with follow-up completed on November 29, 2017. Statistical analyses were conducted from March 29, 2018, to March 6, 2019. Interventions: Four supervised sessions of multidisciplinary rehabilitation and education (2 sessions per week, at least 2 months before TKR, delivered to groups of 4-6 participants at each investigating center; session duration was 90 minutes and included 30 minutes of education followed by 60 minutes of exercise therapy) or usual care (information booklet and standard advice by the orthopedic surgeon) before TKR. Main Outcomes and Measures: The short-term primary end point was the proportion of participants achieving functional independence a mean (SD) of 4 (1) days after surgery defined as level 3 on the 4 functional tests. The midterm primary end point was activity limitations within 6 months after TKR assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the self-administered Western Ontario Questionnaire and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function subscale. Results: A total of 262 patients (mean {$[$}SD{$]$} age, 68.6 {$[$}8.0{$]$} years; 178 women {$[$}68{\%}{$]$}) were randomized (131 to each group). A mean (SD) of 4 (1) days after surgery, 34 of 101 (34{\%}) in the experimental group vs 26 of 95 (27{\%}) in the control group achieved functional independence (risk ratio, 1.4; 97.5{\%} CI, 0.9-2.1; P = .15). At 6 months, the mean (SD) area under the curve for the Western Ontario Questionnaire and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function subscale was 38.1 (16.5) mm2 in the experimental group vs 40.6 (17.8) mm2 in the control group (absolute difference, -2.8 mm2; 97.5{\%} CI, -7.8 to 2.3; P = .31 after multiple imputation). No differences were found in secondary outcomes. Conclusions and Relevance: This randomized clinical trial found no evidence that multidisciplinary prehabilitation before TKR for osteoarthritis improves short-term functional independence or reduces midterm activity limitations after surgery.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the feasibility of delivering a functional exercise-based prehabilitation intervention and its effects on postoperative length of hospital stay, preoperative physical functioning and health-related quality of life in elective colorectal surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this randomised controlled feasibility trial, 22 elective colorectal surgery patients were randomly assigned to exercise prehabilitation (n = 11) or standard care (n = 11). Feasibility of delivering the intervention was assessed based on recruitment and compliance to the intervention. Impact on postoperative length of hospital stay and complications, preoperative physical functioning (timed up and go test, five times sit to stand, stair climb test, handgrip dynamometry and 6-min walk test) and health-related quality of life were also assessed. RESULTS: Over 42{\%} of patients (84/198) screened were deemed ineligible for prehabilitation due to insufficient time existing prior to scheduled surgery. Of those who were eligible, approximately 18{\%} consented to the trial. Median length of hospital stay was 8 {$[$}range 6-27{$]$} and 10 {$[$}range 5-12{$]$} days respectively for the standard care and prehabilitation groups. Patterns towards preoperative improvements for the timed up and go test, stair climb test and 6-min walk test were observed for all participants receiving prehabilitation but not standard care. CONCLUSIONS: Despite prehabilitation appearing to convey positive benefits on physical functioning, short surgical wait times and patient engagement represent major obstacles to implementing exercise prehabilitation programmes in colorectal cancer patients.},

@article{2650,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) are common after cardiac surgery and contribute to an increased risk of postoperative complications, longer length of stay, and increased hospital mortality. Cognitive training (CT) may be able to durably improve cognitive reserve in areas deficient in delirium and POCD and, therefore, may potentially reduce the risk of these conditions. We sought to determine the feasibility and potential efficacy of a perioperative CT program to reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium and POCD in older cardiac surgery patients. METHODS: Randomized controlled trial at a single tertiary care center. Participants included 45 older adults age 60-90 undergoing cardiac surgery at least 10 days from enrollment. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 fashion to either perioperative CT via a mobile device or a usual care control. The primary outcome of feasibility was evaluated by enrollment patterns and adherence to protocol. Secondary outcomes of postoperative delirium and POCD were assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, respectively. Patient satisfaction was assessed via a postoperative survey. RESULTS: Sixty-five percent of eligible patients were enrolled. Median (interquartile range {$[$}IQR{$]$}) adherence (as a percentage of prescribed minutes played) was 39{\%} (20{\%}-68{\%}), 6{\%} (0{\%}-37{\%}), and 19{\%} (0{\%}-56{\%}) for the preoperative, immediate postoperative, and postdischarge periods, respectively. Median (IQR) training times were 245 (136-536), 18 (0-40), and 122 (0-281) minutes for each period, respectively. The incidence of postoperative delirium (CT group 5/20 {$[$}25{\%}{$]$} versus control 3/20 {$[$}15{\%}{$]$}; P = .69) and POCD (CT group 53{\%} versus control 37{\%}; P = .33) was not significantly different between groups for either outcome in this limited sample. CT participants reported a high level of agreement (on a scale of 0-100) with statements that the program was easy to use (median {$[$}IQR{$]$}, 87 {$[$}75-97{$]$}) and enjoyable (85 {$[$}79-91{$]$}). CT participants agreed significantly more than controls that their memory (median {$[$}IQR{$]$}, 75 {$[$}54-82{$]$} vs 51 {$[$}49-54{$]$}; P = .01) and thinking ability (median {$[$}IQR{$]$}, 78 {$[$}64-83{$]$} vs 50 {$[$}41-68{$]$}; P = .01) improved as a result of their participation in the study. CONCLUSIONS: A CT program designed for use in the preoperative period is an attractive target for future investigations of cognitive prehabilitation in older cardiac surgery patients. Changes in the functionality of the program and enrichment techniques may improve adherence in future trials. Further investigation is necessary to determine the potential efficacy of cognitive prehabilitation to reduce the risk of postoperative delirium and POCD.},

	abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A prospective nutritional intervention study for adult spinal deformity (ASD) patients. OBJECTIVE: To investigate how a nutritional intervention affects the incidence of postoperative medical complications and the nutritional status. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The medical complication rate in ASD surgery is very high, and one risk factor is malnutrition. Nutritional intervention may improve the patient's nutritional status and reduce risk, but this is unexplored regarding ASD surgery. METHODS: Malnourished patients (i.e., a prognostic nutritional index {$[$}PNI{$]$} score of <50) scheduled for surgery after November 2018 (Group I) received nutritional intervention consisting of nutritional guidance and supplements on the surgery day. The medical complication rates between Group I and Group NI (malnourished patients who underwent surgery between January 2014 and October 2018; historical controls) were evaluated. The nutritional status courses of Group I and Group NI2 (patients who did not participate in nutritional intervention after November 2018) were assessed. RESULTS: Group I had 24 patients in (mean age, 70 yr), and Group NI had 69 patients (mean age, 68 yr). The mean intervention duration was 41 days. The preoperative PNI score did not differ between the groups, but there was a significant difference in medical complications incidences (Group I: 25{\%}; Group NI: 53.6{\%}; P = 0.015). The nutritional status significantly deteriorated in Group I (PNI: 47-45; P = 0.011) and Group NI2 (61 patients; mean age, 68 yr; PNI: 52-48; P = 0.000), but the PNI changes were significantly smaller in Group I (DeltaPNI: Group I: -1.9, Group NI 2: -3.5; P = 0.027). CONCLUSION: Nutritional intervention with guidance and supplements reduced postoperative medical complications in malnourished patients. The nutritional status of ASD patients requiring surgery also naturally worsened, suggesting that ASD may contribute to malnutrition. Nutritional intervention may reduce the nutritional status deterioration.Level of Evidence: 3.},

	abstract = {The long-term outcomes of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) administration in patients undergoing hepatic resection remain unclear. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of oral supplementation with BCAA-enriched nutrients on postoperative quality of life (QOL) in patients undergoing liver resection. A prospective randomized clinical trial was conducted in 96 patients undergoing hepatic resection. Patients were randomly assigned to receive BCAA supplementation (AEN group, n = 48) or a conventional diet (control group, n = 48). Postoperative QOL and short-term outcomes were regularly and continuously evaluated in all patients using a short-form 36 (SF-36) health questionnaire and by measuring various clinical parameters. This study demonstrated a significant improvement in QOL after hepatectomy for liver neoplasm in the AEN group based on the same patients' preoperative SF-36 scores (P < 0.05). Perioperative BCAA supplementation preserved liver function and general patient health in the short term for AEN group patients compared to those not receiving the nutritional supplement. BCAA supplementation improved postoperative QOL after hepatic resection over the long term by restoring and maintaining nutritional status and whole-body kinetics. This study was registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov (registration number: NCT00945568).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Past trials have shown perioperative immunonutrition to improve the outcome for patients with gastric cancer. The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of preoperative oral immunonutrition on cellular immunity, the duration of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and detailed postoperative complications in patients with gastric cancer. METHODS: Sixty patients with gastric cancer were randomly assigned to two groups: one group received immune-enhanced formulas supplemented with arginine and omega-3 fatty acids (immune-enhancing diet (ID) group, n = 30); the other received standard formulas (conventional diet (CD) group, n = 30) for 7 days before the operation. These groups were well matched in terms of age, sex, operations, cancer stages, and intraoperative variables. The postoperative outcome was evaluated based on clinical variables, including postoperative infectious complications, noninfectious complications, and SIRS duration. In addition, the perioperative state of cellular immunity was evaluated and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The incidence of postoperative infectious complications in the ID group (6{\%}) was significantly (p < 0.05) lower than that of the CD group (28{\%}). The duration of SIRS in the ID group (0.77 +/- 0.9 days) was significantly (p < 0.05) shorter than that in the CD group (1.34 +/- 1.45 days). The postoperative lymphocyte and CD4(+)T-cell counts significantly decreased (p < 0.05) in both groups. However, the number of CD4(+)T-cells on preoperative day 1 and postoperative day 7 was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in the ID group than in the CD group. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative oral immune-enhanced formulas supplemented with arginine and omega-3 fatty acids enhanced the immune status of the patients, reduced the duration of SIRS, and decreased the incidence of postoperative infectious complications. CD4(+)T-cell immunity likely played an important role in the modulation of the postoperative immune and inflammatory response after gastrectomy.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of a short-term, unsupervised exercise intervention before and after colorectal cancer surgery on self-assessed physical recovery. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Preoperative exercise interventions could help improve recovery after colorectal cancer surgery and is currently recommended. METHODS: A randomized, parallel, open-label trial in six university or regional hospitals in Sweden. Inclusion criteria were age >/=20 years and planned elective colorectal cancer surgery. Participants were randomized to either a physical activity intervention with aerobic activity and inspiratory muscle training 2 weeks pre- and 4 weeks postoperatively or usual care. The primary outcome measure was self-assessed physical recovery 4 weeks postoperatively. Analyses were performed according to intention to treat. Outcome assessors were masked regarding the intervention while both participants and physiotherapists were informed due to the nature of the intervention. RESULTS: Between January 22, 2015, and May 28, 2020, 761 participants were recruited and assigned to either intervention (I) (n = 379) or control (C) (n = 382). After exclusions 668 participants (I = 317, C = 351) were included in the primary analysis. There was no effect from the intervention on the primary outcome measure (adjusted odds ratio 0.84, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.62-1.15) with 13{\%} and 15{\%} of participants feeling fully physically recovered in I and C, respectively. There were no reported adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: There was no effect from a physical activity intervention before and after colorectal cancer surgery on short-term self-assessed physical recovery. The results from this study call for reconsiderations regarding current recommendations for preoperative physical activity interventions.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a home-based intensive exercise program to improve physical health of frail elderly patients scheduled for elective total hip arthroplasty (THA). DESIGN: Single-blind pilot randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Patients' homes and a general hospital in The Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Frail patients (N=30) older than 65 years. INTERVENTION: A preoperative, home-based program supervised by an experienced physical therapist to train functional activities and walking capacity. The control group received usual care consisting of 1 session of instructions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Feasibility was determined on the basis of adherence to treatment, patient satisfaction, adverse events, walking distance (measured with a pedometer), and intensity of exercise (evaluated with the Borg scale). Preliminary pre- and postoperative effectiveness was determined by the Timed Up \& Go (TUG) test, 6-minute walk test (6MWT), Chair Rise Time, and self-reported measures of functions, activities, and participation. RESULTS: Patient satisfaction and adherence to the training were good (median=5 on a 5-point Likert scale) and no serious adverse events occurred. The Borg score during training was 14 (range, 13-16). Preoperative clinical relevant differences on the TUG test (2.9 s; 95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$}, -0.9 to 6.6) and significant differences on the 6MWT (41 m; 95{\%} CI, 8 to 74) were found between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Intensive preoperative training at home is feasible for frail elderly patients waiting for THA and produces relevant changes in functional health. A larger multicenter randomized controlled trial is in progress to investigate the (cost-)effectiveness of preoperative training.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Prehabilitation may benefit older patients undergoing major surgeries. Currently, its efficacy has not been conclusively proven. This is a retrospective review of a multimodal prehabilitation programme. METHODS: Patients aged 65 years and above undergoing major abdominal surgery between May 2015 and December 2019 in the National University Hospital were included in our institutional programme that incorporated aspects of multimodal prehabilitation and Enhanced Recovery After Surgery concepts as 1 holistic perioperative pathway to deal with issues specific to older patients. Physical therapy, nutritional advice and psychosocial support were provided as part of prehabilitation. RESULTS: There were 335 patients in the prehabilitation cohort and 256 patients whose records were reviewed as control. No difference in postoperative length of stay (P=0.150) or major complications (P=0.690) were noted. Patients in the prehabilitation group were observed to ambulate a longer distance and participate more actively with their physiotherapists from postoperative day 1 until 4. In the subgroup of patients with cancer, more patients had undergone neoadjuvant therapy in the prehabilitation group compared to the control group (21.7{\%} versus 12.6{\%}, P=0.009). Prehabilitation patients were more likely to proceed to adjuvant chemotherapy (prehabilitation 87.2{\%} vs control 65.6{\%}, P<0.001) if it had been recommended. CONCLUSION: The current study found no differences in traditional surgical outcome measures with and without prehabilitation. An increase in patient mobility in the immediate postoperative period was noted with prehabilitation, as well as an association between prehabilitation and increased adherence to postoperative adjuvant therapy. Larger prospective studies will be needed to validate the findings of this retrospective review.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative complications and length of hospital stay (LOS) are major issues and affect hospital costs. Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols are effective in reducing morbidity and LOS after major surgery. We propose a nutritional protocol within ERAS programs in colorectal surgery, starting from preadmission. METHODS: We compared the ERAS + NutriCatt approach versus the ERAS standard program adopted in our center in the previous months. Complications, LOS, hospital readmission at 30 days, and late complications (at 90 days) were assessed and compared. A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed. RESULTS: A total of 114 patients were treated according to the ERAS program between April 2015 and January 2016; 105 were enrolled in the ERAS + NutriCatt protocol from February to September 2016; Patients' characteristics were similar in the two groups, except for American Society of Anesthesiologists score, which was significantly worse in the ERAS + NutriCatt cohort; preoperative diagnoses and surgical approaches were similar in the two periods. LOS was significantly inferior in the ERAS + NutriCatt protocol (4.9 +/- 1.7 d; 95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$} 4.60-5.28) compared with the standard ERAS program (6.1 +/- 3.9 d, 95{\%} CI 5.36-6.81) (P = 0.006), as were postoperative complications (36, 34.3{\%} versus 55, 48.2{\%}; P = 0.03). Complications within 90 d were 0 in ERAS + NutriCatt and 4 in the ERAS standard cohort. Cost-effectiveness analyses indicated savings in the ERAS + NutriCatt protocol. CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional care, starting from the preadmission visit, is able to reduce LOS, postoperative and late complications, and costs, in addition to ERAS standard items in colorectal surgery.},

	abstract = {Fast-track surgery is a multimodal evidence-based approach to perioperative care aimed at reducing complications and recovery time. We compared a fast-track protocol to standard care in the setting of a small Italian general hospital. Propensity score estimation before and after the study was performed to compare pre-fast-track (pre-FT; January 2013--March 2014) and fast-track (FT; January 2016--December 2016) patients undergoing elective hip and knee replacement surgery with a three-year follow-up (up to January 2020). The primary endpoints were the mean hemoglobin drop, mean predischarge hemoglobin, transfusion and reinfusion rates, pain, ambulation day, hospital length of stay (LOS), and discharge to home/outpatient care or rehabilitation hospital center. The secondary endpoints were the adherence measures to the FT protocol, namely, tourniquet and surgical times, use of drains and catheters, type of anesthesia administered, and complications within three years. The risk difference (RD) and the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) were calculated for each outcome. After the propensity score estimation, we analyzed 59 patients in the pre-FT and 122 in the FT categories. The FT patients, with respect to the pre-FT patients, ameliorated their mean hemoglobin drop from 3.7 to 3.1 g/dl (p < 0.01) and improved their predischarge mean hemoglobin (10.5 g/dL versus 11.0 g/dL; p = 0.01). Furthermore, the aOR of being transfused was reduced by 81{\%} (p < 0,01); the RD of being reinfused was reduced by 63{\%} (p < 0.01); the aOR of having low pain on the first day was increased by more than six times (p < 0.01); the RD of ambulating the first day increased by 91{\%} (p < 0.01); the aOR of admission to a rehabilitation hospital center was reduced by 98{\%} (p < 0.01); the aOR of home discharge increased by 42 times (p < 0.01); the median LOS, tourniquet and surgical times, and use of catheters and drains significantly decreased. Patients with complications at 1 month were 43.1{\%} and 38.2{\%}, respectively, of pre-FT and FT patients (p = 0.63). Complications at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months were significantly lower for the FT patients. This study showed that the uptake of enhanced recovery practices was successful and resulted in the improvement of clinical and organizational outcomes. The fast-track concept and related programs may optimize perioperative care and streamline surgical and rehabilitation care paths.},

@article{4007,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of a short preoperative exercise intervention on the functional status, pain, and muscle strength of patients before and after total joint arthroplasty. METHODS: A total of 108 men and women scheduled for total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA) were randomized to a 6-week exercise or education (control) intervention immediately prior to surgery. We assessed outcomes through questionnaires and performance measures. Analyses examined differences between groups over the preoperative and immediate postoperative periods and at 8 and 26 weeks postsurgery. RESULTS: Among THA patients, the exercise intervention was associated with improvements in preoperative Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function score (improvement of 2.2 in exercisers versus decline of 3.9 in controls; P = 0.02) and Short Form 36 physical function score (decline of 0.4 in exercisers versus decline of 14.3 in controls; P = 0.003). No significant differences were seen in TKA patients. Exercise participation increased muscle strength preoperatively (18{\%} in THA patients and 20{\%} in TKA patients), whereas the control patients had essentially no change in strength (P > 0.05 for exercise versus education in both THA and TKA groups). Exercise participation prior to total joint arthroplasty substantially reduced the risk of discharge to a rehabilitation facility in THA and TKA patients (adjusted odds ratio 0.27, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.074-0.998). The intervention had no effects on outcomes 8 and 26 weeks postoperatively. CONCLUSION: A 6-week presurgical exercise program can safely improve preoperative functional status and muscle strength levels in persons undergoing THA. Additionally, exercise participation prior to total joint arthroplasty dramatically reduces the odds of inpatient rehabilitation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Enhanced recovery protocols may reduce postoperative complications and length of hospital stay. However, the implementation of these protocols requires time and financial investment. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of enhanced recovery implementation. METHODS: The first 50 consecutive patients treated during implementation of an enhanced recovery programme were compared with 50 consecutive patients treated in the year before its introduction. The enhanced recovery protocol principally implemented preoperative counselling, reduced preoperative fasting, preoperative carbohydrate loading, avoidance of premedication, optimized fluid balance, standardized postoperative analgesia, use of a no-drain policy, as well as early nutrition and mobilization. Length of stay, readmissions and complications within 30 days were compared. A cost-minimization analysis was performed. RESULTS: Hospital stay was significantly shorter in the enhanced recovery group: median 7 (interquartile range 5-12) versus 10 (7-18) days (P = 0.003); two patients were readmitted in each group. The rate of severe complications was lower in the enhanced recovery group (12 versus 20 per cent), but there was no difference in overall morbidity. The mean saving per patient in the enhanced recovery group was euro1651. CONCLUSION: Enhanced recovery is cost-effective, with savings evident even in the initial implementation period.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficiency of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) on postoperative respiratory muscle strength, functional capacity, quality of life, and psychosocial status in patients with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. DESIGN: Forty-three patients undergoing CABG surgery were randomly assigned to the one of two groups. All subjects received usual care. In addition, subjects in the intervention group received IMT training pre- and postoperatively. Pulmonary function testing, six minute walk test (6MWT), quality of life and psychosocial parameters were assessed preoperatively and the fifth day after the surgery. RESULTS: The mean inspiratory muscle strength increased from 82.64 cmH(2)O at baseline to 95.45 cmH(2)O five days postoperatively in the intervention group. The intervention group (319.55 +/- 72.17 m before and 387.91 +/- 65.69 m after surgery) covered further distance during the 6MWT than usual care (355.43 +/- 56.08 m before and 357.69 +/- 43.42 m after surgery). The improvement in quality of life was greater in the intervention group for the dimension of sleep. The anxiety scores were significantly lower in the intervention group than the usual care group. The length of intensive care unit stay was significantly shorter in the intervention group than the usual care group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: IMT results in faster recovery of inspiratory muscle strength, functional capacity, intensive care unit stay, quality of life and psychosocial status after CABG.},

	abstract = {AIM: To clarify the effectiveness of preoperative physical therapy for older patients after hip fracture in an acute care hospital. METHODS: In the present retrospective observational study, data from the Japan Rehabilitation Database were analyzed for patients admitted to an acute care hospital with hip fracture between 2005 and 2015. In this study, all eligible patients received surgery within 10 days of admission. Propensity score analysis was used to compare outcomes between patients who underwent preoperative rehabilitation and those who did not. The primary outcome was motor Functional Independence Measure (FIM) gain. RESULTS: Of the 681 patients eligible after applying exclusion criteria, 50{\%} underwent preoperative rehabilitation after hip fracture. Both before and after adjustment by inverse probability weighting, motor FIM gain was significantly higher in patients who underwent preoperative rehabilitation (motor FIM gain 31.1 $\pm$18.2 before weighting, 31.1 $\pm$18.2 after weighting) than in those who did not (motor FIM gain 24.6 $\pm$18.1 before weighting, P < 0.01; 26.2 $\pm$17.6 after weighting, P < 0.02). In addition, motor FIM effectiveness and motor FIM at discharge were significantly higher among patients who underwent preoperative rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that preoperative rehabilitation after hip fracture is associated with better rehabilitation outcomes than no preoperative rehabilitation.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of a preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation programme in patients with lung cancer undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery. DESIGN: Randomized, single-blind controlled trial. SETTING: Teaching hospital. SUBJECTS: Patients with suspected or confirmed lung cancer undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomized to either a prehabilitation group or a control group. Participants in the prehabilitation group underwent a combination of moderate endurance and resistance training plus breathing exercises three to five times per week. MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome of the study was exercise capacity. Secondary outcomes were muscle strength (Senior Fitness Test), health-related quality of life (Short-Form 36) and the postoperative outcomes. Patients were evaluated at baseline (before randomization), presurgery (only the prehabilitation group), after surgery and three months post-operatively. RESULTS: A total of 40 patients were randomized and 22 finished the study (10 in the prehabilitation group and 12 in the control group). Three patients were lost to follow-up at three months. After the training, there was a statistically significant improvement in exercise tolerance (+397 seconds, p = 0.0001), the physical summary component of the SF-36 (+4.4 points, p = 0.008) and muscle strength ( p < 0.01). There were no significant differences between groups after surgery. However, three months postoperatively, significant differences were found in the mean change of exercise capacity ( p = 0.005), physical summary component ( p = 0.001) and upper and lower body strength ( p = 0.045 and p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: A pulmonary rehabilitation programme before video-assisted thoracic surgery seems to improve patients' preoperative condition and may prevent functional decline after surgery.

	abstract = {Background: This study aims to evaluate the effect of preoperative psychological intervention on the prevalence of early Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction (POCD) in patients undergoing Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery (OPCAB). Materials and methods: Two groups of 1:1 paired patients (34 cases each) who underwent selective OPCAB were enrolled. One group received targeted preoperative psychological intervention (the intervention group), while the other group did not (the control group). Levels of preoperative anxiety before and after psychological intervention were evaluated using the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). Occurrence of POCD on postoperative days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14 was examined using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Enumeration and measurement data were compared between groups using χ2 test and paired t-test, respectively. Results: The results indicated that there was no significant difference between patients of the intervention and control groups regarding gender, age, baseline SAS score, cardiac function, operation time, anaesthesia time, and intensive care unit length of stay (p>0.05). After psychological intervention, preoperative SAS score of the intervention group became significantly lower than that of the control group (50.91 $\pm$3.54 vs. 66.76 $\pm$3.18, p<0.05), and the prevalence of POCD was significantly lower in the former than in the latter group on postoperative days 3 (4/34 vs. 9/34), 5 (5/34 vs. 11/34), and 7 (5/34 vs. 10/34) (p<0.05). Conclusion: Preoperative psychological intervention significantly alleviates anxiety and effectively reduces the prevalence of early POCD in patients undergoing OPCAB.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative oral nutritional supplementation has been shown to be of clinical benefit. This study examined the clinical effects and cost of administration of oral supplements both before and after surgery. METHODS: This was a randomized clinical trial conducted in three centres. Patients undergoing lower gastrointestinal tract surgery were randomized to one of four groups: group CC received no nutritional supplements, group SS took supplements both before and after surgery, group CS received postoperative supplements only, and group SC were given supplements only before surgery. Preoperative supplements were given from the time it was decided to operate to 1 day before surgery. Postoperative supplements were started when the patient was able to take free fluids and continued for 4 weeks after discharge from hospital. Data collected included weight change, complications, length of stay, nutritional intake, anthropometrics, quality of life and detailed costings covering all aspects of care. RESULTS: Some 179 patients were randomized, of whom 27 were withdrawn and 152 analysed (CC 44, SS 32, CS 35, SC 41). Dietary intake was similar in all four groups throughout the study. Mean energy intake from preoperative supplements was 536 and 542 kcal/day in the SS and SC groups respectively; that 2 weeks after discharge from hospital was 274 and 361 kcal/day in the SS and CS groups respectively. There was significantly less postoperative weight loss in the SS group than in the CC and CS groups (P < 0.050), and significantly fewer minor complications in the SS and CS groups than the CC group (P < 0.050). There were no differences in the rate of major complications, anthropometrics and quality of life. Mean overall costs were greatest in the CC group, although differences between groups were not significant. CONCLUSION: Perioperative oral nutritional supplementation started before hospital admission for lower gastrointestinal tract surgery significantly diminished the degree of weight loss and incidence of minor complications, and was cost-effective.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We implemented a multidisciplinary pre- and rehabilitation program for elderly patients (≥75 years of age) in a single center consisting of prehabilitation, laparoscopic surgery and early rehabilitation with the intention to lower 1-year overall mortality. METHODS: In this study we compared all patients that underwent elective surgery for stage I-III colorectal cancer before and during development and after implementation of the program (2010-2011, 2012-2013 and 2014-2015). Primary endpoint was 1-year overall mortality, the secondary endpoint was 30-day postoperative outcome. RESULTS: Eighty-six consecutive patients were included in the study cohort and compared to 63 patients from 2010 to 2011 and 75 patients from 2012 to 2013. Patient characteristics were comparable; median age in the study cohort was 80.6. Seventy-three patients (85{\%}) participated in the program, 54 (63{\%}) of whom followed a prehabilitation program, 46 (53{\%}) of whom were discharged to a rehabilitation center. Laparoscopic surgery increased over the years from 70{\%} to 83{\%} in the study cohort. There was a trend in lower 1-year overall mortality: 11{\%} versus 3{\%} (p=0.08). There was a significant reduction in cardiac complications and the number of patients with a prolonged length of stay (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Multidisciplinary care for elderly colorectal cancer patients that includes prehabilitation and rehabilitation is feasible and may contribute to lower complications and reduced length of stay. This study did not show a clear benefit of implementing a comprehensive care program including both prehabilitation and rehabilitation. Dedicated multidisciplinary care seems the key attributer to favorable outcomes of CRC surgery in elderly patients.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of an exercise-based prehabilitation (EBPrehab) program on pre- and postoperative exercise capacity, functional capacity (FC) and quality of life (QoL) in patients awaiting elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). DESIGN: A two-group randomized controlled trail. SETTING: Ambulatory prehabilitation. SUBJECTS: Overall 230 preoperative elective CABG-surgery patients were randomly assigned to an intervention (IG, n = 88; n = 27 withdrew after randomization) or control group (CG, n = 115). INTERVENTION: IG: two-week EBPrehab including supervised aerobic exercise. CG: usual care. MAIN MEASURES: At baseline (T1), one day before surgery (T2), at the beginning (T3) and at the end of cardiac rehabilitation (T4) the following measurements were performed: cardiopulmonary exercise test, six-minute walk test (6MWT), Timed-Up-and-Go Test (TUG) and QoL (MacNew questionnaire). RESULTS: A total of 171 patients (IG, n = 81; CG, n = 90) completed the study. During EBPrehab no complications occurred. Preoperatively FC (6MWT(IG): 443.0 $\pm$80.1 m to 493.5 $\pm$75.5 m, P = 0.003; TUG(IG): 6.9 $\pm$2.0 s to 6.1 $\pm$1.8 s, P = 0.018) and QoL (IG: 5.1 $\pm$0.9 to 5.4 $\pm$0.9, P < 0.001) improved significantly more in IG compared to CG. Similar effects were observed postoperatively in FC (6MWD(IG): Δ-64.7 m, p(T1-T3 = )0.013; Δ+47.2 m, p(T1-T4 < )0.001; TUG(IG): Δ+1.4 s, p(T1-T3 = )0.003). CONCLUSIONS: A short-term EBPrehab is effective to improve perioperative FC and preoperative QoL in patients with stable coronary artery disease awaiting CABG-surgery.ID: NCT04111744 (www.ClinicalTrials.gov; Preoperative Exercise Training for Patients Undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery- A Prospective Randomized Trial).},

	abstract = {Preparing for the stress of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery by exercise training (prehabilitation) may improve strength and function before surgery and, if effective, has the potential to contribute to postoperative recovery. Subjects with severe osteoarthritis (OA), pain intractable to medicine and scheduled for TKA were randomized into a usual care (UC) group (n = 36) or usual care and exercise (UC + EX) group (n = 35). The UC group maintained normal daily activities before their TKA. The UC + EX group performed a comprehensive prehabilitation program that included resistance training using bands, flexibility, and step training at least 3 times per week for 4-8 weeks before their TKA in addition to UC. Leg strength (isokinetic peak torque for knee extension and flexion) and ability to perform functional tasks (6-minute walk, 30 second sit-to-stand repetitions, and the time to ascend and descend 2 flights of stairs) were assessed before randomization at baseline (T1) and 1 week before the subject's TKA (T2). Repeated-measures analysis of variance indicated a significant group by time interaction (p < 0.05) for the 30-second sit-to-stand repetitions, time to ascend the first flight of stairs, and peak torque for knee extension in the surgical knee. Prehabilitation increased leg strength and the ability to perform functional tasks for UC + EX when compared to UC before TKA. Short term (4-8 weeks) of prehabilitation was effective for increasing strength and function for individuals with severe OA. The program studied is easily transferred to a home environment, and clinicians working with this population should consider prehabilitation before TKA.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) has shown to benefit older patients undergoing urological and orthopedic surgery. However, this approach has been scarcely assessed in patients elected for colorectal surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort of patients aged >/=70 years admitted for elective colorectal cancer surgery to a single hospital between 2008 and 2012. Upon admission, patients were assigned to a usual care (UC) plan or a CGA-based care (GS) plan conducted by a multidisciplinary team, according to standard clinical criteria.Analyzed outcomes included the incidence of delirium and other geriatric syndromes during hospital stay, mortality, readmissions, andnumber of perioperative complications. RESULTS: The cohort included 310 patients, 203 assigned to the GS group and 107 to the UC group. Patients in the GS group had significantly lower Barthel and Lawton scores, higher prevalence of dementia and heart failure, and higher comorbidity burden. Fifty-four (17.5{\%}) patientsexperienced delirium (23 {$[$}11.3{\%}{$]$} and 31 {$[$}29.2{\%}{$]$} in the GS and UC groups, respectively; p < .001), and 49 (15.8{\%}) patient experienced other geriatric syndromes (21 {$[$}10.3{\%}{$]$} and 28 {$[$}26.2{\%}{$]$} in the GS and UC groups, respectively; p < .001). Serious complications were more frequent in the GS group: 154 (75.9{\%}) vs 60 (56.1{\%}) in the UC group; p < .001. No significant differences were observed between groups regarding readmissions, and in-hospital and post-discharge (1 year follow-up) mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the poorer clinical condition of patients in the GS group, the CGA-based intervention resulted in a lower incidence of delirium and other geriatric syndromes compared with the UC group.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Elderly patients and patients with a poor cardiac function have increased morbidity rates when undergoing cardiac surgery. The aim of this study was to determine whether addition of glycine to a standard preoperative oral immune-enhancing nutrition supplement (OIENS) improves outcome. Glycine-enriched OIENS was compared with 2 formulas: standard OIENS and control. METHODS: In this double-blind, 3-armed study, patients scheduled to undergo cardiac surgery with the use of extracorporeal circulation received either the glycine-enriched OIENS (OIENS + glyc, n = 24), standard OIENS (OIENS, n = 25), or control formula (Control, n = 25) for minimally 5 preoperative days. Patients were included if they were aged 70 years or older, had a compromised left ventricular function, or were planned for mitral valve surgery. Main outcome measures were postoperative infectious morbidity, organ function, and postoperative recovery. RESULTS: Infectious morbidity was significantly lower in both treatment groups compared with the control group (p = .02). An infection was diagnosed in 5 and 4 patients in the OIENS + glyc and OIENS groups, respectively, and in 12 control patients. Less supportive therapy was necessary to stabilize circulation in both treatment groups compared with the control group. Median length of hospital stay was 7.0, 6.5, and 8.0 days in the OIENS + glyc, OIENS, and control groups, respectively. Inflammatory responses, as measured by systemic levels of proinflammatory cytokines and surface markers on polymorphonuclear cells, were comparable for all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative OIENS reduces postoperative infectious morbidity and results in a more stable circulation; the addition of glycine does not result in any beneficial effect over standard OIENS.},

	abstract = {AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a delirium prevention care protocol on pain, functional status, sleep quality and delirium prevention in patients with hip fractures. BACKGROUND: The development of delirium following hip fracture is common among older patients. According to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 30{\%} of delirium cases are preventable. The prevention of delirium, a multifactorial syndrome, can be achieved through a multicomponent care protocol that targets specific risk factors for delirium. DESIGN: A randomised controlled study was conducted according to the CONSORT 2010 guidelines. The Clinical Trial Registry number is NCT04188795. METHODS: A total of 84 patients were assigned to two groups by block randomisation. The intervention group (n = 41) received nursing care according to a protocol and the control group (n = 43) received standard nursing care. Study data were collected using the demographic information form, the Confusion Assessment Method-Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU), the Barthel Index, the Mini Nutritional Assessment-short form and the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ). The pain of the patients was assessed by using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 80.6 years (standard deviation 8.0; range 65.0- 97.5 years), and the percentage of the male patients were 36.3{\%}. No statistically significant differences were found between the groups in terms of pain and functional status in the preoperative period, on the first postoperative day, or in the predischarge period (p > 0.05 for each). The sleep quality of patients in the intervention group was significantly better than in the control group for all three time measurements (p < 0.05 for each). While 15{\%} of patients in the control group developed delirium, no patient in the intervention group developed delirium (x(2) =6.486, p = 0.026). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that a delirium prevention care protocol may reduce the incidence of delirium and improve sleep quality. RELEVANCE TO PRACTICE: The study highlighted that nurses can contribute to preventing patients' delirium using nonpharmacologic and independent nursing interventions.},

@article{12548,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although several studies have reported the effects of immunonutrition on clinical outcomes, detailed mechanisms of immunonutrition after an operation are still unclear. It was recently reported that resolvin E1, a novel lipid mediator generated from eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), activates factors that reduce inflammation. This randomized clinical trial was designed to investigate not only the effect of immunonutrition on postoperative complications but also the participation of resolvin E1 on anti-inflammatory effects of immunonutrition in patients undergoing major hepatobiliary resection. METHODS: Forty patients who underwent major hepatobiliary resection were divided into 2 groups. Twenty patients received oral supplementation enriched with EPA, arginine, and nucleotides before the operation (group IN). Twenty patients (control group) received no artificial nutrition before the operation (group C). RESULTS: The rate of infectious complications and severity of complications in group IN was significantly lower than in group C (P < .05). Immediately after the operation, plasma resolvin E1 levels were significantly higher in group IN than in group C (P < .05), and plasma interleukin-6 levels were significantly lower in group IN than in group C (P < .05). Preoperative serum EPA levels correlated with plasma resolvin E1 levels immediately after the operation. Plasma resolvin E1 levels correlated with plasma interleukin-6 levels immediately after the operation. CONCLUSION: Preoperative immunonutrition reduced inflammatory responses and protected against the aggravation of postoperative complications in patients undergoing major hepatobiliary resection. Resolvin E1 may play a key role in the resolution of acute inflammation when immunonutrition is supplemented with EPA. (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01256047.).},

	abstract = {Background: Pulmonary rehabilitation can be effective in perioperative condition. Our aim was to examine whether the changes of functional markers are significant and search connections between these values and the severity of postoperative complications. Methods: A total of 238 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients underwent perioperative pulmonary rehabilitation with thoracic surgery. Health status and the following parameters were examined: lung function (FEV1, FVC), chest kinematics {$[$}chest wall expansion (CWE){$]$}, 6-minute walking test (6MWT), breath holding time (BHT), grip strength (GS) and exercise capacity. Patients were separated into three groups: 72 patients had preoperative rehabilitation only (PRE group), 80 had only postoperative rehabilitation (POS group), and 86 patients underwent pre- and postoperative rehabilitation as well (PPO group). Postoperative complications were classed as "severe" and "not severe". We evaluated the changes in functional parameters. Significance was recognized at P < 0.05. Connections in between variables and severity of complications were analyzed. Results: Pulmonary rehabilitation resulted significant changes of all examined parameters in all three groups. The direction of changes were favourable, so all of the changes can be considered to be improvement {$[$}PRE: CWE: 4.2$\pm$2.3 vs. 5.8$\pm$2.2 cm; FEV1: 63.2$\pm$15.6 vs. 70.1$\pm$16.6 {\%}pred; 6-minute walking distance (6MWD): 392.9$\pm$93.5 vs. 443.2$\pm$86.6 m; FVC: 83.1$\pm$15.9 vs. 90.9$\pm$15.6 {\%}pred; POS: CWE: 2.9$\pm$1.4 vs. 5.0$\pm$2.0 cm; FEV1: 56.4$\pm$15.6 vs. 64.6$\pm$16.0 {\%}pred; 6MWD: 354.7$\pm$90.7 vs. 437.0$\pm$96.0 m; FVC: 66.2$\pm$18.7 vs. 76.1$\pm$17.7 {\%}pred; PPO: preoperatively: CWE: 4.0$\pm$2.1 vs. 5.6$\pm$2.6 cm; FEV1: 58.2$\pm$15.1 vs. 67.0$\pm$14.6 {\%}pred; 6MWD: 378.3$\pm$90.5 vs. 441.3$\pm$86.4 m; FVC: 82.4$\pm$16.7 vs. 93.3$\pm$16.7 {\%}pred; postoperatively: CWE: 2.7$\pm$1.5 vs. 4.4$\pm$2.2 cm; FEV1: 47.4$\pm$13.0 vs. 53.4$\pm$14.7 {\%}pred; 6MWD: 341.4$\pm$115.9 vs. 403.3$\pm$98.4 m; FVC: 63.6$\pm$16.9 vs. 72.6$\pm$18.6 {\%}pred; P < 0.05{$]$}. BHT, GS, dyspnoea and health status were also improved significantly. By discriminant analysis 5 of the variables proved to have discriminative value: kilometers travelled via cycle ergometer at the onset of the preoperative rehabilitation, gender, FEV1 after preoperative rehabilitation, extent of the operation and 6MWD before preoperative rehabilitation. These 5 parameters can predict severe complications correctly in 72.5{\%} of all cases. Conclusions: Pulmonary rehabilitation can reduce the functional depletion caused by the thoracic surgical operation. Identification of more predictive factors of severe complications can help making preoperative risk stratification more precisely.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Frail patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) are at increased risk of complications after surgery. Prehabilitation seems promising to improve this outcome and therefore we evaluated the effect of physical prehabilitation on postoperative complications in a retrospective cohort of frail CRC patients. METHODS: The study consisted of all consecutive non-metastatic CRC patients >/=70 years who had elective surgery from 2014 to 2019 in a teaching hospital in the Netherlands, where a physical prehabilitation program was implemented from 2014 on. We performed both an intention-to-treat and per protocol analysis to evaluate postoperative complications in the physical prehabilitation (PhP) and non-prehabilitation (NP) group. RESULTS: Eventually, 334 elective patients were included. The 124 (37.1{\%}) patients in the PhP-group presented with higher age, higher comorbidity scores and walking-aid use compared to the NP-group. Medical complications occurred in 26.6{\%} of the PhP-group and in 20.5{\%} of the NP-group (p = 0.20) and surgical complications in 19.4{\%} and 14.3{\%} (p = 0.22) respectively. In all frailty subgroups, the medical complications were lower in the PhP-group compared to the NP-group (35.9{\%} vs. 45.5{\%} for patients with >/=2 comorbidities, 36.2{\%} vs. 39.1{\%} for ASA score >/= III, 29.2{\%} vs. 45.8{\%} for walking-aid use). Differences were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, patients selected for physical prehabilitation had a worse frailty profile and therefore a higher a priori risk of postoperative complications. However, the postoperative complication rate was not increased compared to patients who were less frail at baseline and without prehabilitation. Hence, physical prehabilitation may prevent postoperative complications in frail CRC patients >/=70 years.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the influence of a preoperative multidisciplinary evaluation for frail older patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) on preoperative decision making and postoperative outcomes. BACKGROUND: Surgery is the main treatment for CRC. Older patients are at increased risk for adverse outcomes. For complex surgical cases, a multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach has been suggested to improve postoperative outcome. Evidence is lacking. METHODS: Historical cohort study from 2015 to 2018 in surgical patients ≥70 years with CRC. Frailty screening was used to appraise the somatic, functional and psychosocial health status. An MDT weighed the risk of surgery versus the expected gain in survival to guide preoperative decision making and initiate a prehabilitation program. Primary endpoint was the occurrence of a Clavien-Dindo (CD) Grade III-V complication. Secondary endpoints included the occurrence of any complication (CD II-V), length of hospital stay, discharge destination, readmission rate and overall survival. RESULTS: 466 patients were included and 146 (31.3{\%}) patients were referred for MDT evaluation. MDT patients were more often too frail for surgery compared to non-MDT patients (10.3{\%} vs 2.2{\%}, P = .01). Frailty was associated with overall mortality (aOR 2.6 95{\%} CI 1.1-6.1). Prehabilitation was more often performed in MDT patients (74.8{\%} vs 23.4{\%} in non-MDT patients). Despite an increased risk, MDT patients did not suffer more postoperative complications (CD III-V) than non-MDT patients (14.9{\%} vs 12.4{\%}; P = .48). Overall survival was worse in MDT patients (35 (32-37) vs 48 (47-50) months in non-MDT patients; P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of preoperative MDT evaluation for frail patients with CRC improves risk stratification and prehabilitation, resulting in comparable postoperative outcomes compared to non-frail patients. However, frail patients are at increased risk for worse overall survival.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Considering the relation between preoperative functional capacity and postoperative complications, enhancing patients' functional capacity before surgery with a prehabilitation program may facilitate faster recovery and improve quality of life. However, time before surgery is short, mandating a multimodal and high-intensity training approach. This study investigated feasibility and safety of a prehabilitation program for colorectal cancer. METHODS: Multimodal prehabilitation was offered to patients eligible for participation and they were assigned to an intervention or control group by program availability. The prehabilitation program consisted of the following four interventions: in-hospital high-intensity endurance and strength training, high-protein nutrition and supplements, smoking cessation, and psychological support. Program attendance, patient satisfaction, adverse events, and functional capacity were determined. RESULTS: Fifty patients participated in this study (prehabilitation 20, control 30). Program evaluation revealed a high (90{\%}) attendance rate and high level of patient satisfaction. No adverse events occurred. Endurance and/or strength were improved. Eighty-six percent of patients with prehabilitation recovered to their baseline functional capacity 4 weeks postoperatively, 40{\%} in the control group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Multimodal prehabilitation including high-intensity training for colorectal cancer patients is feasible, safe, and effective. A randomized controlled trial (NTR5947) was initiated to determine whether prehabilitation may lower morbidity and mortality rates in colorectal surgery.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the postoperative efficacy of a supervised programme of neuromuscular exercise prior to hip or knee arthroplasty. METHODS: In this assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial, we included 165 patients scheduled for hip or knee arthroplasty due to severe osteoarthritis (OA). An 8-week preoperative neuromuscular supervised exercise programme was delivered twice a week for 1 h as adjunct treatment to the standard arthroplasty procedure and compared with the standard arthroplasty procedure alone. The primary outcome was self-reported physical function measured on the activities of daily living (ADL) subscale in the Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS) and the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) questionnaires for patients with hip and knee OA, respectively. Primary endpoint was 3 months after surgery. RESULTS: 165 patients randomised to the two groups were on average 67$\pm$8 years, 84 (51{\%}) had hip OA and 92 (56{\%}) were women. 153 patients (93{\%}) underwent planned surgery and were evaluated postoperatively. There was no statistically significant difference in effects between hip or knee patients (p=0.7370). Three months postoperatively, no difference was found between groups for ADL (4.4, 95{\%} CI -0.8 to 9.5) or pain (4.5, 95{\%} CI -0.8 to 9.9). However, there was a statistically significant difference indicating an effect of exercise over the entire period (baseline to 3-months postoperatively) (p=0.0029). CONCLUSIONS: Eight weeks of supervised neuromuscular exercise prior to total joint arthroplasty (TJA) of the hip or knee did not confer additional benefits 3 months postoperatively compared with TJA alone. However, the intervention group experienced a statistically significant short-term benefit in ADL and pain, suggesting an earlier onset of postoperative recovery.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cognitive training is beneficial in various clinical settings, although its perioperative feasibility and impact remain unknown. The objective of this pilot study was to determine the feasibility of home-based cognitive prehabilitation before major surgery in older adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-one patients were enrolled, randomized, and allocated to either a home-based preoperative cognitive training regimen or no training before surgery. Outcomes included postoperative delirium incidence (primary outcome; assessed with the 3D-Confusion Assessment Method), perioperative cognitive function based on NIH Toolbox measures, hospital length of stay, and physical therapy session participation. Reasons for declining enrollment were reported, as were reasons for opting out of the training program. RESULTS: Postoperative delirium incidence was 6 of 23 (26{\%}) in the prehabilitation group compared with 5 of 29 (17{\%}) in the control group (P=0.507). There were no significant differences between groups in NIH Toolbox cognitive function scoring, hospital length of stay, or physical therapy participation rates. Study feasibility data were also collected and reported. The most common reasons for declining enrollment were lack of computer access (n=19), time commitment (n=9), and feeling overwhelmed (n=9). In the training group, only 5 of 29 (17{\%}) included patients were able to complete the prescribed 7 days of training, and 14 of 29 (48{\%}) opted out of training once home. Most common reasons were feeling overwhelmed (n=4) and computer difficulties (n=3). CONCLUSIONS: Short-term, home-based cognitive training before surgery is unlikely to be feasible for many older patients. Barriers to training include feeling overwhelmed, technical issues with training, and preoperative time commitment.},

	abstract = {Although beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB), arginine (Arg), and glutamine (Gln) may contribute to wound healing, no prospective studies have investigated the efficacy of a compound consisting of HMB, Arg, and Gln (HMB/Arg/Gln) for reducing wound complications following open abdominal surgery. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the usefulness of perioperative nutrition using HMB/Arg/Gln in patients who were scheduled to undergo open surgery for abdominal malignancies in a randomized controlled trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients scheduled for open surgery for abdominal malignancies were randomized to receive HMB/Arg/Gln (1.2 g HMB, 7 g L-Arg, and 7 g L-Gln) or placebo (isocaloric juice). The supplements were provided once daily for 3 days preoperatively and once daily for 7 days postoperatively. The primary endpoint was the incidence of wound complications. Secondary endpoints included the incidence of other complications, postoperative duration of hospital stay, total-body skeletal muscle mass, handgrip strength, and skin water content. RESULTS: Sixty-one patients were randomly assigned to either the HMB/Arg/Gln (n = 31) or the placebo (n = 30) group. One patient in the HMB/Arg/Gln group was ineligible because laparoscopic surgery was performed; thus, 60 patients were analyzed. The incidence of wound complications (20{\%}) was the same in both groups (P = 1.000). There were no significant differences in the incidence of other complications, body composition, handgrip strength, or skin water content between the 2 groups. Serum growth hormone (GH) levels were significantly higher for patients whose total intake was > 80{\%} of planned volume in the HMB/Arg/Gln group. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of wound complications would not be reduced by perioperative HMB/Arg/Gln administration in patients who underwent open surgery. The efficacy of HMB/Arg/Gln for increasing serum GH levels needs to be validated in another large-scale randomized controlled trial.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preoperative phase can be effectively used by multidisciplinary teams to optimize the surgical candidate to improve perioperative outcomes. The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of prehabilitation program (PP) in patients undergoing elective liver resection (LR). METHODS: This was a prospective study including patients undergoing elective LR from February 2016 to October 2017. Outcomes of patients enrolled into PP were compared with patients receiving standard care. PP involved physiotherapist, dietitian, and case managers along with surgical and anesthetic services. Postoperative morbidity, length of stay, 90-day mortality, readmission rate, quality of life, and cost were measured. RESULTS: Seventy patients were enrolled into PP and compared with 34 patients receiving standard care. Median Charlson comorbidity index was higher in PP group (4 versus 3, P = 0.03). PP showed reduction in overall morbidity (30{\%} versus 52.9{\%}, P = 0.02) and social issues (nil versus 3, P = 0.03). Quality of life survey showed improved social well-being.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: We investigated the impact of preoperative short-term rehabilitation on activities of daily living among patients with colorectal cancer. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study utilized a hospital-based database containing Diagnosis Procedure Combination survey data from over 100 participating acute-care hospitals. We extracted data on consecutive inpatients hospitalized with stage 1 and 2 colorectal cancer. We compared characteristics and outcomes between patients who underwent short-term rehabilitation before surgery and those who did not. Primary outcomes measured were Barthel Index decline and number of complications during hospitalization. RESULTS: Among of included inpatients (male, 57{\%}; older individuals aged over 65 years, 79{\%}; mean Barthel Index, 93.4), the number of patients who underwent preoperative rehabilitation was 760 (39.3{\%}). Patients in the preoperative rehabilitation group were less likely to have a decline in the Barthel Index compared with the control group (5.9{\%} vs 10.1{\%}, P < 0.001) and after propensity score adjustment using inverse probability weighting (6.3{\%} vs 9.8{\%}, P = 0.024). The preoperative rehabilitation group had fewer complications during hospitalization compared with the control group (P < 0.001) and after inverse probability weighting (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our study showed that preoperative short-term rehabilitation was associated with maintenance and improvement of activities of daily living and fewer complications among patients with stage 1 and 2 colorectal cancer.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine the effect of a more-efficient home care protocol to manage total joint replacement (TJR) patients after surgery. DESIGN: A randomized trial of two home care protocols for TJR management. SETTING: A hospital-affiliated home healthcare agency in a large midwestern city. PARTICIPANTS: Medicare-eligible individuals undergoing elective total hip or knee replacement surgery (N = 136). INTERVENTION: A home care protocol that included preoperative home visits by a nurse and a physical therapist and fewer postoperative visits (range of 9-12 visits) to the home than an existing protocol (range of 11-47 visits). MEASUREMENTS: Functional status, lower extremity functioning, health-related quality of life, satisfaction with care, and use and cost of healthcare services for 6 months postsurgery. RESULTS: There were no differences in functional status, health-related quality of life, or lower extremity functioning by group at 6 months. A marginally significant gain in satisfaction with access to care (P =.059) was found in the intervention group at 6 months. Home healthcare costs were 55{\%} lower for the streamlined group (P <.001). Other costs did not differ significantly by group. CONCLUSION: TJR patients who received the more-efficient home care protocol experienced comparable outcomes to those who received the existing protocol. An abbreviated set of home care visits resulted in more-efficient delivery of care without compromising patient outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background: This study introduces the results of laparoscopic radical cystectomy with modified intracorporeal ileal conduit (mICIC), which was accompanied by enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols. Methods: From March 2014 to June 2020, 48 patients underwent mICIC. Patients were divided into ERAS (n=17) and non-ERAS groups (n=31). Baseline and perioperative variables were analyzed. The primary outcome was 90-day complications. Secondary outcomes were operative time, length of stay, two-year overall survival, cancer-specific survival, and disease-free survival. Results: Forty-eight patients underwent intracorporeal ileal conduit with no transition to open surgery. Twenty-five patients (52.1{\%}) experienced at least one complication, including 22 minor cases (45.8{\%}) and three major cases (6.2{\%}). The median operative time, urinary diversion time, estimated blood loss, and length of stay were 320 min, 135 min, 200 mL, and 10.5 days, respectively. The median time to flatus and normal diet were two days and three days, respectively. A comparison between ERAS and non-ERAS groups indicated that ERAS implementation was associated with less complications (29.4{\%} vs. 64.5{\%}, P=0.018), faster time to flatus (2 vs. 3 days, P=0.016) and liquid diet (2 vs. 4 days, P<0.001). The results of hydronephrosis and compromised renal function showed no difference between the preoperative period and six months after surgery. The mean follow-up time was 25.4 months, and the two-year overall survival, cancer-specific survival, and disease-free survival rates were 61.3{\%}, 73.2{\%}, and 58.4{\%}, respectively. Conclusions: The complication rate and operative time of the mICIC were acceptable. Clinical outcomes can be optimized with ERAS pathway.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is compelling support for implementing prehabilitation to optimize perioperative risk factors and to improve postoperative outcomes. However, there is limited evidence studying the application of multimodal prehabilitation for patients with breast cancer. OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility of multimodal prehabilitation as part of the breast cancer treatment pathway. DESIGN: This was a prospective, cohort observational study. Breast cancer patients undergoing surgery were recruited. They were assigned to an intervention or control group according to patient preference. SETTING: UK prehabilitation center. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 75 patients were referred during the study period. Forty eight patients (64{\%}) did not participate; 20 of those opted to be in the control group. Twenty four patients engaged with prehabilitation and returned completed questionnaires. In total, 44 patients were included in the analysis. INTERVENTIONS: The program consisted of supervised exercise, nutritional advice, smoking cessation, and psychosocial support. OUTCOME MEASURES: Feasibility was determined by the center's ability to deliver the program. This was measured by the number of patients who wanted to access the service, compared with those able to. Service uptake, patient satisfaction, and project costs were recorded. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and the use of healthcare resources were also evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 61 patients (81{\%}) wanted to participate; 24 (32{\%}) were able to partake and return questionnaires. Reasons for nonparticipation included surgery within weeks, full-time commitments, and transportation difficulties. A total of 25 (93{\%}) prehabilitation patients recorded high satisfaction with the program. There was a significant reduction in anxiety among prehabilitation patients. There were no significant improvements in the other PROs. There were no changes to hospital length of stay, readmissions, and complications. CONCLUSIONS: Multimodal prehabilitation is a feasible intervention. Logistical challenges need to be addressed to improve engagement. These results are limited and would require a larger sample to confirm the findings. Work on a thorough cost-benefit analysis is also required.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Patients with postoperative pulmonary complications after esophagectomy often have increased mortality. The purpose of the study was to examine the efficacy of preventing postoperative pulmonary complications by an intensive preoperative respiratory rehabilitation (PR) program for esophageal cancer patients. METHODS: This study was a prospective randomized controlled study. Thirty patients in the PR group and 30 patients in the no preoperative respiratory rehabilitation (NPR) group were included. The PR group received preoperative rehabilitation for more than 7 days, while the NPR group did not receive any preoperative rehabilitation. All patients underwent postoperative rehabilitation from the first postoperative day. The postoperative pulmonary complications were evaluated using the Clavien-Dindo classification (CDC) and the Utrecht Pneumonia Scoring System (UPSS). RESULTS: The CDC grade in the PR group was significantly lower than that in the NPR group (p = 0.014). The UPSS score in the PR group was significantly lower than that in the NPR group at postoperative day 1 (p = 0.031). In the multivariate analysis, NPR was an independent risk factor for postoperative pulmonary complications greater than CDC grade II (OR: 3.99, 95{\%} CI: 1.28-12.4, p = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the intensive PR program was capable of reducing the postoperative pulmonary complications in esophageal cancer patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The value of preoperative nutritional support in liver resection remains questionable. The aim of the present study was to compare the incidence of postoperative complications after liver resection between those patients that received preoperative immunonutrition versus those patients without preoperative nutritional support. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Patients undergoing elective liver resection between 9 November 2007 and 14 May 2013 were considered for the study: 84 with preoperative immunonutrition (Oral-Impact, Nestle, 3 x 237 ml per day for seven days at home) and 63 control patients without preoperative nutritional support. To reduce selection bias, propensity score matching was performed. Primary endpoint was the overall complication rate. Secondary endpoints were infectious and major complications. RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients could be matched (49 in each group). Seventy-seven patients (78.6{\%}) had a minor and 21 patients (21.4{\%}) a major liver resection. The two groups were balanced for age, gender distribution, American Society of Anesthesiology score 3, NRS 2002 score, weight loss>10{\%}, cirrhosis, steathosis, preoperative chemotherapy, pathology, major liver resection and extrahepatic procedures. No significant differences were observed in the overall complication rate (53.0{\%} versus 51.0{\%}), infectious complications (38.7{\%} versus 28.5{\%}) and major complications (12.2{\%} versus 10.2{\%}) for the immunonutrition and control group, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The present study did not permit to demonstrate an impact of preoperative immunonutrition with Oral-Impact on postoperative complications after minor liver resection.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of preoperative rehabilitation training on the rehabilitation of patients after total knee arthroplasty. METHODS: A total of 120 patients diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis and undergoing total knee arthroplasty were selected and divided into experimental group and control group according to a random number table, with 60 cases in each group. The control group only carried out routine clinical nursing before the operation, and the experimental group used the formulated preoperative rehabilitation training method based on the control group for training. By comparing the visual analogue score (VAS), keen society score (KSS), postoperative time to get out of bed for the first time, patient satisfaction, and other related indicators between the two groups of patients, the recovery of keen joint function of patients after surgery was evaluated. RESULTS: The visual analogue scale (VAS) of the experimental group was significantly lower than that of the experimental group at three days after operation. The keen society score (KSS) of the experimental group was significantly better than that of the control group at three days after surgery and one month after surgery. The time to get out of bed for the first time after operation in the experimental group (44.93 +/- 13.63) was significantly less than that in the control group (78.33 +/- 13.52). The patient satisfaction of the experimental group was significantly higher than that of the control group (88.30 +/- 3.61). The above statistical results were all p < 0.05 of the two groups, and the differences were statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Preoperative rehabilitation training can significantly reduce the pain of patients after knee replacement, improve the functional state of knee joints, shorten the time to get out of bed for the first time after surgery, and win the best recovery opportunity, which can better improve patient satisfaction in hospitalization and improve medical care services level.},
