	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inguinal hernia repair is a common surgical procedure, and different types of anesthetic techniques are in use. We wanted to test if preoperative inguinal field block (IFB) with ropivacaine would provide benefits in the postoperative period compared with general anesthesia and wound infiltration. METHODS: Sixty patients scheduled for inguinal hernia repair were randomized to receive general anesthesia with wound infiltration postoperatively, or inguinal field block (IFB) before surgery, with no or only light sedation intraoperatively. General anesthesia was induced with midazolam, fentanyl and propofol, maintained with propofol and alfentanil, and supplemented with nitrous oxide in oxygen through a laryngeal mask. The IFB was performed by an anesthesiologist, with 50-60 ml ropivacaine and 5 mg/ml with a dedicated technique. RESULTS: All significant differences were in favor of the IFB group: less pain (visual analog scale, verbal pain score) postoperatively and until day 7, faster mobilization with less pain, lower analgesic consumption, and higher patient satisfaction. CONCLUSION: Preoperative inguinal field block for hernia repair provides benefits for patients in terms of faster recovery, less pain, better mobilization and higher satisfaction throughout the whole first postoperative week.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In this study, postoperative pain and anxiety level of the patients who were scheduled for spinal anesthesia (SA) and remained awake during the operation and patients who were scheduled for general anesthesia (GA) and were asleep during the operation were assessed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-six patients who underwent total knee arthroplasty in our clinic were randomly divided into two groups. The first group (SA group) was given spinal anesthesia during operation (heavy marcaine), while the second group (GA group) underwent general anesthesia (propofol + nitric oxide). Hospital anxiety-depression (HAD) scores and visual analog scale (VAS) scores of the patients were calculated postoperatively. The patients were asked to score anxiety by the physicians. RESULTS: The mean postoperative HAD score was 24.68 in GA group, and 29.62 in SA group (p>0.05). The physicians score for patients' anxiety after surgery was 1.05 in GA group, and 1.69 in SA group (p<0.05). The mean postoperative VAS of the patients was 8.42 in GA group, and 8.87 in SA group (p>0.05). No statistically significant differences were found between the SA group and GA group in terms of HAD scores. No significant differences were found between the mean postoperative VAS scores of the groups. A statistically significant difference was found between the two groups for the physician's score for patients' postoperative anxiety. CONCLUSION: Our study results showed that total knee arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia was not associated with mood changes in patients and no increase in postoperative pain was seen.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Spinal anesthesia can be a potential risk factor for postoperative urinary retention (POUR). Our objective was to compare POUR rates for outpatient vaginal pelvic floor surgeries when using spinal versus general anesthesia. Our hypothesis was that spinal anesthesia would have higher POUR rates compared with general anesthesia. METHODS: This was a randomized clinical trial on subjects undergoing outpatient pelvic organ prolapse (POP) surgery with a concomitant midurethral sling (MUS). Subjects were discharged home the same day as surgery. Subjects were excluded if they had a preoperative post-void residual > 150 ml, they were < 40 years of age, surgery was < 1 h, or they had contraindications to spinal or general anesthesia. A standardized voiding trial was performed. The primary aim was to compare POUR rates between anesthesia groups. A power analysis estimated 28 subjects were required per group to detect a 37{\%} difference with 80{\%} power and an alpha of 0.05. RESULTS: The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov on July 15, 2015. Sixty-one subjects were enrolled between June 22, 2015, and December 31, 2017. Three were excluded, leaving 29 in each group. Groups were similar in demographics. For the primary outcome, there was a 14.3{\%} difference in POUR rates between spinal and general anesthesia, which did not reach statistical significance based on our power calculation (p = 0.2516). CONCLUSIONS: Based on this study, there is not an increased rate of POUR with the use of spinal anesthesia for POP surgery with MUS. However, since there was a trend toward higher rates of POUR in the spinal group, it is possible that a larger powered study design would be able to detect a statistically significant difference between the groups. Based on these findings, if surgical patients would benefit from spinal anesthesia, the risk of urinary retention should not be considered a reason to not utilize this form of anesthesia. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Does spinal anesthesia for prolapse surgery with concomitant sling lead to an increase in urinary retention compared to general anesthesia? https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02547155?term=laura+martin\&rank=3 (NCT02547155).},

@article{15278,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIM: This is a feasibility study evaluating whether segmental epidural anesthesia is an alternative anesthetic approach to general anesthesia for percutaneous kyphoplasty. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After ethics committee approval was obtained, 52 ASA class I-III patients scheduled for elective, single-level percutaneous kyphoplasty were recruited. The patients were divided into two equal groups. In Group E (Group Epidural) segmental epidural anesthesia was performed using the loss of resistance technique with saline. In Group G (Group Control) general anesthesia was performed. Hemodynamic parameters, intraoperative and postoperative analgesic requirements, visual analogue scale (VAS) scores, length of stay in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), and complications were recorded. RESULTS: Hemodynamics were similar between the two groups. Postoperative analgesic requirement was significantly higher in Group G than in Group E (P < 0.004). VAS scores were significantly lower in Group E than in Group G (P < 0.05). Time to first pain experience at the first postoperative 4 h was significantly longer and length of stay in the PACU was significantly shorter in Group E than in Group G (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Segmental epidural anesthesia is a safe anesthetic technique for percutaneous kyphoplasty. This technique offered advantages over general anesthesia in terms of postoperative analgesia, analgesic consumption, early recovery, and short PACU stay. Therefore, it should be considered a suitable anesthetic technique in patients undergoing single level percutaneous kyphoplasty.},

@article{6540,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Proximal femur fractures are most common fractures in the elderly and associated with significant mortality and morbidity, with high economic and social impact. Perioperative pain management influence outcomes and mortality after surgery with early mobilization being possible. The goal of the study was to compare the efficacy and safety of the psoas compartment block (PCB) with spinal and general anesthesia. METHODS: We included 90 patients in this randomized controlled study and divided them into three groups. For patients in group 1 ultrasound-guided PCB with bupivacaine 0.125{\%} 6-8 ml / h was performed. Intraoperative anesthesia was provided with PCB and a sciatic nerve block. Postoperative analgesia include prolonged CPB with bupivacaine 0.125{\%} 6-8 ml / h. In group 2 intraoperative spinal anaesthesia were performed. Group 3 patients underwent general sevoflurane inhalation anaesthesia with fentanyl infusion for analgesia. All patients received paracetamol 3 g/day and dexketoprofen 75 mg/day during hospitalization. On-demand, nalbuphine 5 mg SC was used for analgesia. Efficacy outcomes were the ICU length of stay and the total duration of hospitalization, number of patients who had severe pain after surgery, incidence of on-demand analgesia, sleep quality, postoperative mobilization time. Safety outcomes include complication incidence. RESULTS: There were no differences in the duration of ICU stay - gr.1 72 {$[$}70-75{$]$}, gr.2 74 {$[$}72-76{$]$}, gr.3 72 {$[$}70-75{$]$} hours respectively (p = 0.29), and the total duration of hospitalization - gr.1144 {$[$}170-184{$]$}, gr.2170 {$[$}148-188{$]$}, gr.3178 {$[$}144-200{$]$} hours respectively. Patients in gr.1 had significantly lower nalbuphine consumption in the first 24 h after surgery and total during hospitalization (0 {$[$}0-5{$]$} mg versus 15 {$[$}10-20{$]$} and 20 {$[$}15-25{$]$} mg in the first 24 h in groups 2 and 3, respectively (p < 0.001). Gr. 1 had lower number of patients with severe pain (10{\%} vs. 47 and 60{\%} in groups 2 and 3, respectively, p < 0.05), lower number of on demand analgesia (0 {$[$}0-1{$]$} vs. 3 {$[$}2-4{$]$} and 4 {$[$}3, 4{$]$} in groups 2 and 3, respectively), better sleep quality (8 {$[$}7-9{$]$} vs. 6 {$[$}5-7{$]$} and 4 {$[$}3, 4{$]$} in groups 2 and 3, respectively, p < 0.001), significantly faster mobilization after surgery - sitting in bed and getting to his feet. MINS was diagnosed significantly more often in gr. 2 and 3 compared with gr. 1 (OR 9 95 CI 1,01-77, p = 0,048 for gr. 2 and OR 11 95 CI 1,2-91, p = 0, 03 for gr. 3). However, none of the patients had symptoms of myocardial ischemia and was not diagnosed with myocardial infarction. There were no difference in the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia and delirium. CONCLUSION: Perioperative PCB in elderly patients with a proximal femur fracture could be an effective analgesia technique, as it decrease the number of patients with severe pain, need for on demand analgesia and opioid consumption. PCB also decrease the incidence of opioid-associated nausea and vomiting, comparing to general anesthesia, and increase the number of patients, who was mobilized in the 1st day (sitting) and 2nd day (getting up) after surgery. PCB may reduce the incidence of MINS, although to assess this outcome more studies are needed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04648332 , first registration date 1/12/2020.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reducing depth of anesthesia and anesthetic exposure may help prevent delirium, but trials have been conflicting. Most studies were conducted under general anesthesia or in cognitively impaired patients. It is unclear whether reducing depth of anesthesia beyond levels consistent with general anesthesia reduces delirium in cognitively intact patients. The authors' objective was to determine whether a bundled approach to reduce anesthetic agent exposure as determined by Bispectral Index (BIS) values (spinal anesthesia with targeted sedation based on BIS values) compared with general anesthesia (masked BIS) reduces delirium. METHODS: Important eligibility criteria for this parallel-arm randomized trial were patients 65 yr or greater undergoing lumbar spine fusion. The intervention group received spinal anesthesia with targeted sedation to BIS greater than 60 to 70. The control group received general anesthesia (masked BIS). The primary outcome was delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method daily through postoperative day 3, with blinded assessment. RESULTS: The median age of 217 patients in the analysis was 72 (interquartile range, 69 to 77). The median BIS value in the spinal anesthesia with targeted sedation based on BIS values group was 62 (interquartile range, 53 to 70) and in the general anesthesia with masked BIS values group was 45 (interquartile range, 41 to 50; P < 0.001). Incident delirium was not different in the spinal anesthesia with targeted sedation based on BIS values group (25.2{\%} {$[$}28 of 111{$]$} vs. the general anesthesia with masked BIS values group (18.9{\%} {$[$}20 of 106{$]$}; P = 0.259; relative risk, 1.22 {$[$}95{\%} CI, 0.85 to 1.76{$]$}). In prespecified subgroup analyses, the effect of anesthetic strategy differed according to the Mini-Mental State Examination, but not the Charlson Comorbidity Index or age. Two strokes occurred among patients receiving spinal anesthesia and one death among patients receiving general anesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: Spinal anesthesia with targeted sedation based on BIS values compared with general anesthesia with masked BIS values did not reduce delirium after lumbar fusion. EDITOR'S PERSPECTIVE:},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chemotherapeutic stop-flow perfusion is a new investigational treatment for locally advanced cancers that is usually performed under general anesthesia (GA), and, less frequently, under spinal anesthesia (SA). We designed this clinical trial to compare the clinical profiles of GA and SA for stop-flow perfusion. METHODS: Anesthesia and recovery times, scores on visual analog scales for postoperative pain, and postoperative nausea and vomiting, and admission to the postanesthesia care unit were measured in 40 cancer patients who randomly received either GA with propofol, nitrous oxide/sevoflurane, and fentanyl, or SA with bupivacaine hydrochloride for lower limb or pelvic stop-flow perfusion. RESULTS: GA and SA did not differ in times to achieve home readiness or patient satisfaction. Compared with GA, SA significantly (P < 0.05) reduced anesthesia times (34 vs 16 min), postoperative visual analog scale scores for pain (5 vs 0) and nausea (8 vs 2), and the number of admissions to the postanesthesia care unit (9 vs 0). CONCLUSIONS: For stop-flow perfusion, GA and SA are both effective, but SA provides faster recovery, superior analgesia, and less postoperative nausea and vomiting in the immediate postoperative period.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: This prospective, randomized study was conducted to compare unilateral spinal block using small doses of hyperbaric bupivacaine and single-agent anaesthesia with sevoflurane in elderly patients undergoing hip surgery. METHODS: Thirty patients (> 65 yr) undergoing hip fracture repair were randomly allocated to receive unilateral spinal anaesthesia with hyperbaric bupivacaine 7.5 mg 0.5{\%} (Group Spinal, n = 15) or volatile induction and maintenance anaesthesia with sevoflurane (Group SEVO, n = 15). General anaesthesia was induced by increasing the inspired concentration to 5{\%}. A laryngeal mask airway was placed without muscle relaxants, and the end-tidal concentrations of sevoflurane were adjusted to maintain cardiovascular stability. Hypotension (decrease in systolic arterial pressure > 20{\%} from baseline), hypertension or bradycardia (heart rate < 50 beats min(-1)) requiring treatment, and the length of stay in the postanaesthesia care unit was recorded. Cognitive functions were evaluated the previous day, and 1 and 7 days after surgery with the Mini Mental State Examination test. RESULTS: Hypotension occurred in seven patients of Group Spinal (46{\%}) and in 12 patients of Group SEVO (80{\%}) (P = 0.05). Phenylephrine was required to control hypotension in three spinal patients (21{\%}) and four SEVO patients (26{\%}) (n.s.). SEVO patients had lower heart rates than spinal patients from 15 to 60 min after anaesthesia induction (P = 0.01). Bradycardia was observed in three SEVO patients (22{\%}). Discharge from the postanaesthesia care unit required 15 (range 5-30) min in Group Spinal and 55 (15-80) min in Group SEVO (P = 0.0005). Eight patients in Group Spinal (53{\%}) and nine patients in Group SEVO (60{\%}) showed cognitive decline (Mini Mental State Examination test decreased > or = 2 points from baseline) 24 h after surgery (n.s.). Seven days after surgery, confusion was still present in one patient of Group Spinal (6{\%}) and in three patients of Group SEVO (20{\%}) (n.s.). CONCLUSIONS: In elderly patients undergoing hemiarthroplasty of the hip, induction and maintenance with sevoflurane provide a rapid emergence from anaesthesia without more depression of postoperative cognitive function compared with unilateral spinal anaesthesia. This technique represents an attractive option when patient refusal, lack of adequate co-operation or concomitant anticoagulant therapy contraindicate the use of spinal anaesthesia.},

	abstract = {Objective. To compare postoperative outcomes in patients having primary total knee arthroplasty receiving general or regional anaesthesia. Design. Randomised prospective study. Setting. Regional hospital, Hong Kong. Patients. Patients having primary total knee replacement were randomised to either general anaesthesia followed by postoperative intravenous patient-controlled analgesia with morphine, or combined spinal-epidural anaesthesia followed by postoperative epidural infusion of bupivacaine 0.1{\%} with fentanyl 2 μg/mL. Main outcome measures. Visual analogue scale pain scores, perioperative blood loss, time to first meal and ambulation, and prevalence of postoperative complications. Results. Sixty consecutive patients were enrolled in this study. Postoperative median pain scores were consistently lower at 1 (P<0.0001), 6 (P=0.08), 12 (P=0.003), 24 (P=0.14), and 48 hours (P=0.007) in those given regional anaesthesia. Although there was a trend towards fewer complications in the latter group, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups with respect to the incidence of postoperative blood loss, haemodynamic instability, pruritus, nausea, vomiting, urinary retention, or other surgical/ medical complications. Postoperatively, patients given regional anaesthesia also resumed meals earlier (P<0.0001), and showed a trend towards earlier ambulation and hospital discharge. Conclusion. Chinese patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty with regional anaesthesia/regionally delivered analgesia enjoyed better postoperative pain relief and resumed meals earlier than those receiving general anaesthesia/intravenous patient-controlled analgesia. The former also showed trends towards less adverse effects, postoperative complications, earlier ambulation, and earlier hospital discharge.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a serious complication associated with total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and has been shown to increase the length of hospital stay, cause functional impairment, and morbidity. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine whether POCD is associated with the use of general or regional anesthesia in patients undergoing TKA. Our hypothesis was that POCD would be reduced in the group that received regional analgesia without any sedations. Our secondary hypothesis was POCD would be associated with biomarkers of surgical stress. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled study between general and spinal anesthesia. SETTING: Single-centered, university hospital, from January to October 2017. METHODS: A total of 112 patients were assessed for eligibility, and a total of 57 patients completed the study. We divided the patients into general and regional anesthesia groups. Blood samples were obtained preoperatively at the first intraoperative, the third and the 24th postoperative hour. C-reactive protein (CRP), cortisol, insulin, and blood glucose levels were tested. We used 4 neurocognitive tests that were administered 1 day before operation, 7 days and 30 days after operation. Main outcome measures were neurocognitive tests scores for regional anesthesia without sedation and general anesthesia groups. Cortisol, glucose, insulin, and CRP levels. RESULTS: Patients who received regional anesthesia showed significantly higher Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scored compared with the general anesthesia at the seventh day (P = 0.037). In the general anesthesia group, patients showed significantly higher variations for the Stroop number difference. There were negative correlations between MMSE scores measured at postoperative day 7 and the 1-hour intraoperative cortisol measurements (r = -0.302; P = 0.022) and 3-hour postoperative cortisol measurements (r = -0.295; P = 0.026). LIMITATIONS: A limitation was the small number of patients. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that regional anesthesia results in better neurocognitive test scores than general anesthesia in patients undergoing TKA. Patients who received regional anesthesia showed lower cortisol, higher insulin, and lower glucose levels. We recommend that patients who undergo arthroplasty surgeries should receive regional anesthesia to avoid POCD at the early stages of the postoperative period.

	abstract = {Patients having cataract surgery are usually elderly and have risk factors for ischemic heart disease. We sought to determine the incidence of perioperative myocardial ischemia in patients having cataract surgery and compare the influence of local anesthesia (LA) and general anesthesia (GA). Eighty-one patients undergoing cataract surgery with at least two risk factors for ischemic heart disease were monitored continuously for 24 h by using electrocardiogram leads II and V5 and a Holter recorder (Medilog 4500, Oxford Ltd, UK). Patients were randomly allocated to two groups, either LA (n = 39) or GA (n = 42). In the LA group, a peribulbar block was performed, whereas a similar block was performed in the GA group after tracheal intubation. The study demonstrated that cataract patients suffered from a frequent incidence of perioperative myocardial ischemia (31{\%}). There was no difference in the incidence rate between the groups: 12 of 39 in the LA group and 13 of 42 in the GA group (P: = NS). However, the number of ischemic episodes was significantly increased in the GA group (18 vs. 13 in the LA group) (P<0.05), and there were significantly more intraoperatively in the GA group (8 vs. 1) (P<0.01). All intraoperative ischemic events were associated with tachycardia (> or =20{\%} of baseline), whereas postoperative ischemic changes were mostly independent of heart rate. Only one of the ischemic patients (in the GA group) was admitted as a result of intractable chest pain. There were significantly less intraoperative episodes in the LA group, suggesting that LA may be safer than GA in patients during this type of surgery.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim was to compare the feasibility of ultrasound-guided multiple nerve blocks (fascia iliaca compartment block+sacral plexus block+superior cluneal nerve block) with general anesthesia in geriatric hip fracture patients. METHODS: Ninety-four patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: group N received ultrasound-guided multiple nerve blocks and group G received general anesthesia. Primary outcome measures included perioperative Pain Threshold Index (PTI) and Numerical Rating Scale. Secondary outcome measures comprised the following: (1) perioperative Delirium Index and Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire; (2) perioperative Comfort Index; (3) perioperative opioid consumption (within 72 hours postoperatively); and (4) postoperative side effects (within 72 h postoperatively). RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients completed the study. Baseline PTI was comparable between the groups. However, intraoperative PTI was significantly lower in group N than in group G. Preoperative and postoperative Comfort Index scores were comparable between the groups. Moderate delirium (24 to 72 h postoperatively) was significantly higher than the baseline in group G. Early moderate delirium (24 h postoperatively) was significantly higher in group G than in group N. Severe delirium was comparable between the groups and within each group. High intraoperative PTI was associated with high opioid consumption. The intravenous sufentanil dose in group G was twice of that in group N. Incidence of nausea and vomiting was similar between the groups. DISCUSSION: Ultrasound-guided multiple nerve blockade may be an alternative to the common anesthetic procedures used for geriatric hip fracture patients. It provided satisfactory intraoperative pain management and reduced early postoperative cognitive disorders.},

Methods: In this randomized double blind trial 100 patients (50 patients in each group) older than 60 years under hip surgery were randomized in general anesthesia with sevoflurane and spinal anesthesia with lidocaine 5{\%}. Hemodynamic changes including mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate, blood loss, pain severity, nausea and vomiting and opioids consumption were compared in two groups. Results: During surgery, difference between two groups regarding changes in mean arterial pressure was not significant, but the changes in heart rate were significantly different. Mean arterial pressure changes during recovery between two groups were significantly different. But there was no significant difference in heart rate changes. Bleeding in the sevoflurane group was significantly more than spinal group (513.ml vs. 365 ml). Moreover, AS Score, opioid consumption, and the nausea and vomiting in spinal anesthesia group was significantly lower than the sevoflurane group. Conclusion: We showed that general anesthesia with sevoflurane and spinal anesthesia with low dose lidocaine 5{\%} have comparable effects on hemodynamics changes in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The choice of anaesthetic technique for patients undergoing joint arthroplasty is debatable. The hypothesis of this study was that general anaesthesia would generate a more favourable recovery profile than spinal anaesthesia. METHODS: We randomly allocated 120 patients to either intrathecal bupivacaine or general anaesthesia with target-controlled infusion of remifentanil and propofol. Length of hospital stay assessed as meeting discharge criteria was the primary outcome parameter. Other outcome parameters were actual time of discharge, pain, use of rescue pain medication, blood loss, length of stay in the post-operative care unit, dizziness, post-operative nausea, need of urinary catheterisation and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: General anaesthesia resulted in slightly reduced length of hospital stay (26 vs. 30 h, P = 0.004), less nausea (P = 0.043) and dizziness (P < 0.001). General anaesthesia patients had higher pain scores during the first two post-operative hours (P < 0.001) but lower after 6 h compared with the spinal anaesthesia group (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05). General anaesthesia patients had better orthostatic function compared with spinal anaesthesia patients (P = 0.008). Patients in the spinal anaesthesia group fulfilled the discharge criteria from the post-operative care unit earlier compared with the general anaesthesia patients (P = 0.004). General anaesthesia patients requested a change in the method of anaesthesia for a subsequent operation less often than the spinal anaesthesia patients (5 vs. 13, P = 0.022). CONCLUSION: General anaesthesia resulted in a more favourable recovery profile compared with spinal anaesthesia.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study was undertaken to compare the effects of general anaesthesia (GA) and spinal anaesthesia (SA) on the need for postoperative hospitalization and early postoperative comfort in patients undergoing fast-track total knee arthroplasty (TKA). METHODS: One hundred and twenty subjects were randomly allocated to receive either intrathecal bupivacaine (SA group) or GA with target controlled infusion of propofol and remifentanil (GA group). Primary outcome was length of hospital stay (LOS) defined as time from end of surgery until the subject met the hospital discharge criteria. Secondary outcome parameters included actual time of discharge, postoperative pain, intraoperative blood loss, length of stay in the Post Anaesthesia Care Unit, dizziness, postoperative nausea and vomiting, need for urinary catheterization and subject satisfaction. RESULTS: GA resulted in shorter LOS (46 vs 52 h, P<0.001), and less nausea and vomiting (4 vs 15, P<0.05) and dizziness (VAS 0 mm vs 20 mm, P<0.05) compared with SA. During the first 2 postoperative hours, GA patients had higher pain scores (P<0.001), but after 6 h the SA group had significantly higher pain scores (P<0.001). Subjects in the GA group used fewer patient-controlled analgesia doses and less morphine (P<0.01), and were able to walk earlier compared with the SA group (P<0.001). Subjects receiving SA would request a change in the method of anaesthesia in the event of a subsequent operation more often than the GA subjects (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: GA had more favourable recovery effects after TKA compared with SA.},

	abstract = {General or regional anaesthesia can be used for chronic subdural haematoma evacuation, but no study has compared these types of anaesthesia in terms of peri-operative outcomes. This single-centre, prospective, randomised study included adult patients (age >/= 18 years) undergoing surgical chronic subdural haematoma evacuation. Patients were randomly allocated to general (target-controlled total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol and remifentanil) or regional anaesthesia (bilateral scalp block with remifentanil sedation if required). The primary outcome measure was duration of hospital stay, based on the day patients were judged by an investigator blinded from the allocation group to be medically fit for discharge. Secondary outcomes included: rate of regional anaesthesia failure; rate of intra-operative and postoperative adverse events at 24 hours; and pain scores at 24 hours. Data from 60 patients were analysed (30 general anaesthesia and 30 regional anaesthesia). Median (IQR {$[$}range{$]$}) time until patients were judged medically fit for discharge was 3 (3-3 {$[$}2-10{$]$}) days and 3 (2-5 {$[$}2-15{$]$}) days for general and regional anaesthesia, respectively (p = 0.700). Regional anaesthesia failed in two patients. There were more intra-operative adverse events in patients who received general anaesthesia (25 vs. 11, respectively; p = 0.001). The occurrence of postoperative adverse events was similar for general and regional anaesthesia (16 vs. 13 patients, respectively; p = 0.605). In patients requiring chronic subdural haematoma evacuation, general and regional anaesthesia are comparable in terms of duration of time until medically fit for discharge and occurrence of postoperative complications. The rate of intra-operative adverse events (mainly arterial hypotension) is greater with general anaesthesia.},

@article{16573,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the role of fast-track surgery in preventing the development of postoperative delirium and other complications in elderly patients with colorectal carcinoma. METHODS: A total of 240 elderly patients with colorectal carcinoma (aged ≥70 years) undergoing open colorectal surgery was randomly assigned into two groups, in which the patients were managed perioperatively either with traditional or fast-track approaches. The length of hospital stay (LOS) and time to pass flatus were compared. The incidence of postoperative delirium and other complications were evaluated. Serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were determined before and after surgery. RESULTS: The LOS was significantly shorter in the fast-track surgery (FTS) group than that in the traditional group. The recovery of bowel movement (as indicated by the time to pass flatus) was faster in the FTS group. The postoperative complications including pulmonary infection, urinary infection and heart failure were significantly less frequent in the FTS group. Notably, the incidence of postoperative delirium was significantly lower in patients with the fast track therapy (4/117, 3.4 {\%}) than with the traditional therapy (15/116, 12.9 {\%}; p = 0.008). The serum IL-6 levels on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3 in patients with the fast-track therapy were significantly lower than those with the traditional therapy (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to traditional perioperative management, fast-track surgery decreases the LOS, facilitates the recovery of bowel movement, and reduces occurrence of postoperative delirium and other complications in elderly patients with colorectal carcinoma. The lower incidence of delirium is at least partly attributable to the reduced systemic inflammatory response mediated by IL-6.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To evaluate the influence of anesthetic technique on perioperative neurological and cardiopulmonary complication rates in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 186 patients with symptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis > 70{\%} or asymptomatic ICA stenosis > 80{\%} were prospectively randomized for either locoregional (LA) or general anesthesia (GA). RESULTS: Neurological complication rates were similar in both groups (GA 2{\%} vs. LA 2{\%}). Cardiopulmonary complication rates were not significantly different (GA 4{\%} vs LA 1{\%}). There were no stroke-related deaths, but one patient from the GA group died from severe postoperative pneumonia. Thus, a significant difference in combined stroke/cardiopulmonary related death between the two groups (GA 1{\%} vs LA 0{\%}) could not be found. However, perioperative cardiopulmonary monitoring showed that significantly more patients operated under general anesthesia had hypertensive events, with systolic blood pressure values greater than 180 mmHg on postoperative day one. There were no differences in the number of postoperatively hypotensive episodes (systolic blood pressure values < 100 mmHg) between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences in the perioperative neurological and cardiopulmonary complication rates between general and locoregional anesthesia in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy could not be observed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The effect of carotid endarterectomy in lowering the risk of stroke ipsilateral to severe atherosclerotic carotid-artery stenosis is offset by complications during or soon after surgery. We compared surgery under general anaesthesia with that under local anaesthesia because prediction and avoidance of perioperative strokes might be easier under local anaesthesia than under general anaesthesia. METHODS: We undertook a parallel group, multicentre, randomised controlled trial of 3526 patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid stenosis from 95 centres in 24 countries. Participants were randomly assigned to surgery under general (n=1753) or local (n=1773) anaesthesia between June, 1999 and October, 2007. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with stroke (including retinal infarction), myocardial infarction, or death between randomisation and 30 days after surgery. Analysis was by intention to treat. The trial is registered with Current Control Trials number ISRCTN00525237. FINDINGS: A primary outcome occurred in 84 (4.8{\%}) patients assigned to surgery under general anaesthesia and 80 (4.5{\%}) of those assigned to surgery under local anaesthesia; three events per 1000 treated were prevented with local anaesthesia (95{\%} CI -11 to 17; risk ratio {$[$}RR{$]$} 0.94 {$[$}95{\%} CI 0.70 to 1.27{$]$}). The two groups did not significantly differ for quality of life, length of hospital stay, or the primary outcome in the prespecified subgroups of age, contralateral carotid occlusion, and baseline surgical risk. INTERPRETATION: We have not shown a definite difference in outcomes between general and local anaesthesia for carotid surgery. The anaesthetist and surgeon, in consultation with the patient, should decide which anaesthetic technique to use on an individual basis.

	abstract = {Importance: In adults undergoing hip fracture surgery, regional anesthesia may reduce postoperative delirium, but there is uncertainty about its effectiveness. Objective: To investigate, in older adults undergoing surgical repair for hip fracture, the effects of regional anesthesia on the incidence of postoperative delirium compared with general anesthesia. Design, Setting, and Participants: A randomized, allocation-concealed, open-label, multicenter clinical trial of 950 patients, aged 65 years and older, with or without preexisting dementia, and a fragility hip fracture requiring surgical repair from 9 university teaching hospitals in Southeastern China. Participants were enrolled between October 2014 and September 2018; 30-day follow-up ended November 2018. Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive either regional anesthesia (spinal, epidural, or both techniques combined with no sedation; n = 476) or general anesthesia (intravenous, inhalational, or combined anesthetic agents; n = 474). Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was incidence of delirium during the first 7 postoperative days. Secondary outcomes analyzed in this article include delirium severity, duration, and subtype; postoperative pain score; length of hospitalization; 30-day all-cause mortality; and complications. Results: Among 950 randomized patients (mean age, 76.5 years; 247 {$[$}26.8{\%}{$]$} male), 941 were evaluable for the primary outcome (6 canceled surgery and 3 withdrew consent). Postoperative delirium occurred in 29 (6.2{\%}) in the regional anesthesia group vs 24 (5.1{\%}) in the general anesthesia group (unadjusted risk difference {$[$}RD{$]$}, 1.1{\%}; 95{\%} CI, -1.7{\%} to 3.8{\%}; P = .48; unadjusted relative risk {$[$}RR{$]$}, 1.2 {$[$}95{\%} CI, 0.7 to 2.0{$]$}; P = .57{$]$}). Mean severity score of delirium was 23.0 vs 24.1, respectively (unadjusted difference, -1.1; 95{\%} CI, -4.6 to 3.1). A single delirium episode occurred in 16 (3.4{\%}) vs 10 (2.1{\%}) (unadjusted RD, 1.1{\%}; 95{\%} CI, -1.7{\%} to 3.9{\%}; RR, 1.6 {$[$}95{\%} CI, 0.7 to 3.5{$]$}). Hypoactive subtype in 11 (37.9{\%}) vs 5 (20.8{\%}) (RD, 11.5; 95{\%} CI, -11.0{\%} to 35.7{\%}; RR, 2.2 {$[$}95{\%} CI, 0.8 to 6.3{$]$}). Median worst pain score was 0 (IQR, 0 to 20) vs 0 (IQR, 0 to 10) (difference 0; 95{\%} CI, 0 to 0). Median length of hospitalization was 7 days (IQR, 5 to 10) vs 7 days (IQR, 6 to 10) (difference 0; 95{\%} CI, 0 to 0). Death occurred in 8 (1.7{\%}) vs 4 (0.9{\%}) (unadjusted RD, -0.8{\%}; 95{\%} CI, -2.2{\%} to 0.7{\%}; RR, 2.0 {$[$}95{\%} CI, 0.6 to 6.5{$]$}). Adverse events were reported in 106 episodes in the regional anesthesia group and 102 in the general anesthesia group; the most frequently reported adverse events were nausea and vomiting (47 {$[$}44.3{\%}{$]$} vs 34 {$[$}33.3{\%}{$]$}) and postoperative hypotension (13 {$[$}12.3{\%}{$]$} vs 10 {$[$}9.8{\%}{$]$}). Conclusions and Relevance: In patients aged 65 years and older undergoing hip fracture surgery, regional anesthesia without sedation did not significantly reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium compared with general anesthesia.

MATERIAL AND METHODS We allocated 198 patients preparing to undertake THA into 3 groups: general anesthesia group (GA group, n=66), caudal epidural anesthesia group (CEA group, n=66), and spinal-epidural anesthesia group (SEA group, n=66). We compared postoperative adverse effects occurring in patients of the 3 anesthesia groups. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score, Minimum Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, and β-amyloid (Aβ) expression were calculated to determine the effects of different anesthesia on the postoperative pain and cognitive dysfunction of patients. RESULTS The CEA and SEA groups had lower rates of perioperative adverse effects than in the GA group. Patients in the GA group required significantly higher administration of analgesics after the surgery than those in CEA and SEA groups. Higher Aβexpression levels and VAS scores, as well as lower MMSE scores, were also seen in the GA group compared with the other 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS CEA and SEA were more effective than GA in THA, and CEA seemed to be a better anesthesia technique than SEA.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Post-operative cognitive dysfunction is the subtle cerebral complication temporally seen following surgery. The aim of this study was to compare the influence of either general anesthesia (GA) or epidural anesthesia (EA) on the early post-operative neurocognitive outcome in elderly (>59 years) subjects undergoing hip and knee surgery. METHODS: A total of 60 patients were recruited in a prospective, randomized, parallel-group study, comparable by age and sex. They were enrolled and randomized to receive either EA (n = 30) or GA (n = 30). All of them were screened using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), with components of the Kolkata Cognitive Screening Battery. The operated patients were re-evaluated 1 week after surgery using the same scale. The data collected were analyzed to assess statistical significance. RESULTS: We observed no statistical difference in cognitive behavior in either group pre-operatively, which were comparable with respect to age, sex and type of surgery. Grossly, a significant difference was seen between the two groups with respect to the perioperative changes in verbal fluency for categories and MMSE scores. However, these differences were not significant after the application of the Bonferroni correction for multiple analyses, except the significant differences observed only in the MMSE scores. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a difference in cognitive outcome with GA compared with EA. Certain aspects of the cognition were affected to a greater extent in this group of patients undergoing hip and knee surgery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Subclinical neurocognitive deficit after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been reported in 25{\%} of patients. The influence of the type of anesthesia and shunting on early postoperative neurocognitive function remains unclear. Therefore, we analyzed the cognitive function after CEA using a battery of psychometric tests before surgery and on the first postoperative day. METHODS: Twenty nine patients under regional and 28 under general anesthesia were included in the study. Regional anesthesia was administered inducing a superficial cervical block, and the general anesthesia was induced using a standardized manner. Then cognitive function was tested using a battery of psychometric tests before and 24 hours after surgery. S 100 beta was determined at the same time points. RESULTS: A statistical difference was found between the results of the testing before and after CEA: decline in digit symbol test (9{\%}), perceptual speed (6{\%}), and spatial working memory (44{\%}) and improvement in verbal fluency (6{\%}) and attention (5{\%}). The only intraoperative factor that correlated with the cognitive dysfunction was shunt insertion; patients with a shunt had a lower perceptual speed (P=0.005) and worse spatial working memory (P=0.004). No correlation was found between the type of anesthesia or S 100 beta level and any psychometric test, but these results might be influenced by the small sample size in our study. CONCLUSIONS: Shunt insertion was the only parameter correlated with cognitive decline on the first day after CEA. Regional anesthesia might offer indirect benefit because of a reduced need of shunting in wakeful patients. Larger studies are required to clarify the role of shunting and type of anesthesia in early neurocognitive deficit after CEA and its impact on the quality of life.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Intraoperative hypotension during hip fracture surgery is frequent in the elderly. No study has compared the haemodynamic effect of hypobaric unilateral spinal anaesthesia (HUSA) and standardised general anaesthesia (GA) in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgical repair. METHODS: We performed a prospective, randomised open study, including 40 patients aged over 75 years, comparing the haemodynamic effects of HUSA (5 mg isobaric bupivacaine with 5 μg sufentanil and 1 mL sterile water) and GA (induction with etomidate/remifentanil and maintenance with desflurane/remifentanil). An incidence of severe hypotension, defined by a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >40{\%} from baseline, was the primary endpoint. RESULTS: The incidence of severe hypotension was lower in the HUSA group compared with that in the GA group (32{\%} vs. 71{\%}, respectively, p=0.03). The median {$[$}IQR{$]$} ephedrine consumption was lower (p=0.001) in the HUSA group (6 mg, 0-17 mg) compared with that in the GA group (36 mg, 21-57 mg). Intraoperative muscle relaxation and patients' and surgeons' satisfaction were similar between groups. No difference was observed in 5-day complications or 30-day mortality. CONCLUSION: This study shows that HUSA provides better haemodynamic stability than GA, with lower consumption of ephedrine and similar operating conditions. This new approach of spinal anaesthesia seems to be safe and effective in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgery.},

	abstract = {The optimal anesthetic technique for peripheral vascular surgery remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of spinal versus general anesthesia on postoperative pain, analgesic requirements and postoperative comfort in patients undergoing peripheral vascular surgery. A total of 40 patients scheduled for peripheral vascular surgery were randomly assigned to two groups of 20 patients each to receive general anesthesia (GA) or spinal anesthesia (SA). In GA group, anesthesia was induced using thiopental and fentanyl. Vecuronium was used for muscle relaxation. Anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane and nitrous oxide. In the SA group, hyperbaric 0.5{\%} bupivacaine was injected into the subarachnoid space. Postoperative pain was assessed for 24 hours by a visual analog scale during three assessment periods: 0-4, 4-12 and 12-24 h as well as analgesic requirements. Patients were also asked to assess their postoperative state as satisfactory or unsatisfactory with regard to the pain, side effects and postoperative nausea and vomiting. Visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score was significantly lower in the group SA compared with group GA. This effect was mainly due to the lower pain score during the first study period. The patients received general anesthesia also reported a significantly higher rate of unsatisfactory postoperative comfort than those receiving spinal anesthesia. We conclude that spinal anesthesia is superior to general anesthesia when considering patients' satisfaction, side effects and early postoperative analgesic management.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The effects of spinal anesthesia as compared with general anesthesia on the ability to walk in older adults undergoing surgery for hip fracture have not been well studied. METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic, randomized superiority trial to evaluate spinal anesthesia as compared with general anesthesia in previously ambulatory patients 50 years of age or older who were undergoing surgery for hip fracture at 46 U.S. and Canadian hospitals. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive spinal or general anesthesia. The primary outcome was a composite of death or an inability to walk approximately 10 ft (3 m) independently or with a walker or cane at 60 days after randomization. Secondary outcomes included death within 60 days, delirium, time to discharge, and ambulation at 60 days. RESULTS: A total of 1600 patients were enrolled; 795 were assigned to receive spinal anesthesia and 805 to receive general anesthesia. The mean age was 78 years, and 67.0{\%} of the patients were women. A total of 666 patients (83.8{\%}) assigned to spinal anesthesia and 769 patients (95.5{\%}) assigned to general anesthesia received their assigned anesthesia. Among patients in the modified intention-to-treat population for whom data were available, the composite primary outcome occurred in 132 of 712 patients (18.5{\%}) in the spinal anesthesia group and 132 of 733 (18.0{\%}) in the general anesthesia group (relative risk, 1.03; 95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$}, 0.84 to 1.27; P = 0.83). An inability to walk independently at 60 days was reported in 104 of 684 patients (15.2{\%}) and 101 of 702 patients (14.4{\%}), respectively (relative risk, 1.06; 95{\%} CI, 0.82 to 1.36), and death within 60 days occurred in 30 of 768 (3.9{\%}) and 32 of 784 (4.1{\%}), respectively (relative risk, 0.97; 95{\%} CI, 0.59 to 1.57). Delirium occurred in 130 of 633 patients (20.5{\%}) in the spinal anesthesia group and in 124 of 629 (19.7{\%}) in the general anesthesia group (relative risk, 1.04; 95{\%} CI, 0.84 to 1.30). CONCLUSIONS: Spinal anesthesia for hip-fracture surgery in older adults was not superior to general anesthesia with respect to survival and recovery of ambulation at 60 days. The incidence of postoperative delirium was similar with the two types of anesthesia. (Funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute; REGAIN ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02507505.).},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare operating conditions, intraoperative adverse events, recovery profiles, postoperative adverse effects, patient satisfaction, and costs of small-dose lidocaine spinal anesthesia with those of general anesthesia using fentanyl and propofol for elderly outpatient prostate biopsy. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, blind study. SETTING: Outpatient anesthesia unit at a municipal hospital. PATIENTS: 80 ASA physical status I and II patients, aged 65 to 80 years, scheduled for outpatient prostate biopsy. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were assigned to receive either spinal anesthesia with 10 mg of hyperbaric 1{\%} lidocaine (L group, n=40) or anesthetic induction with fentanyl 1 microg.kg-1 IV and 1.0 mg.kg-1 propofol injected at 90 mg.kg-1.h-1, followed by continuous infusion at 6 mg.kg-1.h-1 (F/P group, n=40). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Both anesthetic techniques provided acceptable operating conditions for the surgeon. However, a significantly higher frequency of intraoperative hypotension was found in the F/P group than in the L group (P<0.05). Time to home readiness was shorter in the F/P group (P<0.05). Both techniques had no major postoperative adverse effects and resulted in a high rate of patient satisfaction. Total costs were significantly lower in the L group than in the F/P group (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Spinal anesthesia with 10 mg of hyperbaric 1{\%} lidocaine may be a more suitable alternative to general anesthesia with fentanyl and propofol for ambulatory elderly prostate biopsy in terms of safety and costs.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We aim to compare selective spinal anesthesia and general anesthesia with regard to postoperative recovery and fast-track eligibility in day surgeries. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Sixty geriatric outpatient cases, with ASA II-III physical status and requiring short-duration transurethral intervention, were enrolled in the study. The cases were split into 2 groups: as general anesthesia (Group GA) and selective spinal anesthesia (Group SSA). Group GA (n = 30) received propofol 2 mg kg⁻¹(until loss of eyelash reflex), remifentanil induction 0.5-1 µg kg⁻¹, and laryngeal mask. Maintenance was achieved by 4-6{\%} desflurane in 60{\%} N₂O and 40{\%} O₂along with remifentanil infusion at 0.05 µg /kg⁻¹/min⁻¹. Drugs were discontinued after the withdrawal of the ureteroscope, and extubation was carried out with 100{\%} O₂. Group SSA (n = 30) received 0.5{\%} spinal anesthesia via L4-5 space by 0.5{\%} hyperbaric bupivacaine 5 mg. Anesthesia preparation time, time to surgical anesthesia level, postoperative fast-tracking, and time to White-Song recovery score of 12, were noted. In the operating room, we evaluated hemodynamics, nausea/vomiting, surgeon and patient satisfaction with anesthesia, perioperative midazolam-fentanyl administration, postoperative pain, and discharge time. RESULTS: Anesthesia preparation time, length of surgery, anesthesia-related time in the operating room, time to sit, and time to walk were significantly low in Group GA (p < 0.05), whereas time to fast-track eligibility, length of stay in the PACU, discharge time, and other parameters were similar in both of the groups. CONCLUSION: While anesthesia preparation time, length of surgery, start time of surgery, time to sit, and time to walk were shorter in the General Anesthesia group, time to fast-track eligibility, phase 1 recovery time, and discharge time were similar among patients subjected to selective spinal anesthesia.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Postoperative confusion and delirium is a common complication in the elderly with a poorly understood pathophysiology. The aim of this study was to examine whether the type of anaesthesia (general or regional) plays a role in the development of cognitive impairment in elderly patients during the immediate postoperative period. METHODS: Forty-seven patients > 60 yr of age and undergoing major surgery were randomly allocated to receive either regional or general anaesthesia. The mental status of the patients was assessed preoperatively and during the first three postoperative days with the Mini Mental State Examination. The incidence of delirium was also examined during the same period with the use of DSM III criteria. RESULTS: Overall, during the first three postoperative days, the mean Mini Mental State Examination score decreased significantly (P < 0.001). However, this decline was very significant only in patients assigned to receive general anaesthesia (P < 0.001) compared to regional anaesthesia. Nine patients developed delirium but the type of anaesthesia did not affect its incidence. The only important factor for the development of delirium was preexisting cardiovascular disease irrespective of anaesthesia type (P < 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients subjected to general anaesthesia displayed more frequent cognitive impairment during the immediate postoperative period in comparison to those who received a regional technique.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Spinal anaesthesia (SA) and general anaesthesia (GA) are widely used techniques for vaginal surgery for pelvic floor disorders with inconclusive evidence of the superiority of either. We conducted a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to assess the feasibility of a full scale RCT aiming to examine the effect of anaesthetic mode for vaginal surgery on operative, patient reported and length of hospital stay (LOHS) outcomes. METHODS: Patients undergoing vaginal surgery, recruited through a urogynaecology service in a University teaching hospital, were randomised to receive either GA or SA. Patients were followed up for 12 weeks postoperatively. Pain was measured on a visual analogue scale; nausea was assessed with a four-point verbal rating scale. Patient's subjective perception of treatment outcome, quality of life (QoL) and functional outcomes were assessed using the International Consultation on Incontinence Modular Questionnaire (ICIQ) on vaginal symptoms and the SF-36 questionnaire. RESULTS: Sixty women were randomised, 29 to GA and 31 to SA. The groups were similar in terms of age and type of vaginal surgery performed. No statistically significant differences were noted between the groups with regard to pain, nausea, quality of life (QoL), functional outcomes as well as length of stay in the postoperative recovery room, use of analgesia postoperatively and LOHS. CONCLUSION: This study has demonstrated that a full RCT is feasible and should focus on the length of hospital stay in a subgroup of patients undergoing vaginal surgery where SA may help to facilitate enhanced recovery or day surgery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common complication after cardiac and major non-cardiac surgery with general anaesthesia in the elderly. We hypothesized that the incidence of POCD would be less with regional anaesthesia rather than general. METHODS: We included patients aged over 60 years undergoing major non-cardiac surgery. After giving written informed consent, patients were randomly allocated to general or regional anaesthesia. Cognitive function was assessed using four neuropsychological tests undertaken preoperatively and at 7 days and 3 months postoperatively. POCD was defined as a combined Z score >1.96 or a Z score >1.96 in two or more test parameters. RESULTS: At 7 days, POCD was found in 37/188 patients (19.7{\%}, {$[$}14.3-26.1{\%}{$]$}) after general anaesthesia and in 22/176 (12.5{\%}, {$[$}8.0-18.3{\%}{$]$}) after regional anaesthesia, P = 0.06. After 3 months, POCD was present in 25/175 patients (14.3{\%}, {$[$}9.5-20.4{\%}{$]$}) after general anaesthesia vs. 23/165 (13.9{\%}, {$[$}9.0-20.2{\%}{$]$}) after regional anaesthesia, P = 0.93. The incidence of POCD after 1 week was significantly greater after general anaesthesia when we excluded patients who did not receive the allocated anaesthetic: 33/156 (21.2{\%}{$[$}15.0-28.4{\%}{$]$}) vs. 20/158 (12.7{\%}{$[$}7.9-18.9{\%}{$]$}) (P = 0.04). Mortality was significantly greater after general anaesthesia (4/217 vs. 0/211 (P < 0.05)). CONCLUSION: No significant difference was found in the incidence of cognitive dysfunction 3 months after either general or regional anaesthesia in elderly patients. Thus, there seems to be no causative relationship between general anaesthesia and long-term POCD. Regional anaesthesia may decrease mortality and the incidence of POCD early after surgery.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To investigate the effect of general and subarachnoid (spinal) anesthesia on the incidence of postoperative delirium and cognitive impairments in elderly Chinese patients. Methods: Elderly Chinese patients (n = 281) aged 65 - 79 years (mean age = 74.12 $\pm$4.15 years) who underwent proximal femoral fracture surgery were recruited over a 1-year period for this study. The patients were evaluated using neuropsychological assessment battery (NAB) 24 h before surgery, and on the first day 1 month after surgery. Data on activity of daily living (ADL) (in this case toileting at the time of discharge) were recorded and analyzed. Results: There was no significant difference in the number of patients that developed postoperative delirium between the two anesthesia groups (p > 0.05). Although the trail making test (TMT) scores (parts A and B) were increased on the first day 1 month after surgery, there were no significant differences in NAB results between the two groups (p > 0.05). Patients who received subarachnoid (spinal) anesthesia had significantly higher dependency for toileting at the time of discharge than those who received general anesthesia (p < 0.05). Conclusion: These results show that general and subarachnoid (spinal) anesthesia do not cause postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction in elderly Chinese patients who underwent proximal femoral fracture surgery.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of general anesthesia (GA) versus spinal anesthesia (SpA) on intraoperative and postoperative outcome in patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy. METHODS: Seventy-two consecutive patients with clinically localized prostate cancer were randomized into group 1 (GA: 34 patients) or group 2 (L2-L3 or L3-L4 SpA: 38 patients) and underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy. The intraoperative and postoperative anesthetic and surgical variables were evaluated. RESULTS: The mean +/- SEM operative time was not significantly different between the two groups (P = 0.43). The overall blood loss was less in group 2 (P = 0.04). The mean +/- SEM postoperative time in the postoperative holding area was significantly shorter after SpA than after GA (P <0.0001). The perioperative pain outcome in the postoperative holding area was significantly better for group 2 than for group 1 (P = 0.0017), but postoperative pain on day 1 was not significantly different between the two groups. The postoperative sedation score was significantly less in group 2 than in group 1 (P <0.0001). On day 1, first flatus passed in a significantly larger number of patients in group 2 (P <0.0001), and the overall gait was greater for group 2 patients (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that SpA allows good muscle relaxation and a successful surgical outcome in patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer. Moreover, SpA results in less intraoperative blood loss, less postoperative pain, and a faster postoperative recovery than GA.},

	abstract = {AIM: To assess the impact of spinal anesthesia (SpA) combined with three different forms of conscious sedation on intraoperative and postoperative outcome in patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) for organ confined prostate cancer (pCa). METHODS: A total of 121 consecutive patients with pCa undergoing RRP were randomized into four groups. They were randomized as follows: group 1 (general anesthesia: 34 patients), group 2 (lumbar 2 to lumbar 3 interspace SpA with diazepam as sedative agent: 28), group 3 (SpA with propofol: 30), and group 4 (SpA with midazolam: 29). Intraoperative and perioperative parameters were collected. RESULTS: The present study showed that muscle relaxation throughout RRP was not different in the four groups; bleeding was significantly (P = 0.04) lower with SpA, regardless of the form of sedation. Group 3 patients reported the best postoperative oxygen saturation percentage by pulse oximetry and sedation score (P = 0.02; d.f. = 3 and P < 0.0001; d.f. = 3, respectively), the shortest waiting time in the postoperative holding area (P < 0.001; d.f. = 3), the lowest pain on postoperative day 1 (P = 0.0004; d.f. = 3), and the highest frequency of first flatus passage (P = 0.0001; d.f. = 3). A higher number of group 4 patients were able to carry out unassisted ambulation (P < 0.0001; d.f. = 3). CONCLUSIONS: Conscious sedation coupled with SpA is a safe, reliable and effective procedure for patients undergoing RRP. The use of propofol as sedative agent offers several advantages both over other types of conscious sedation and general anesthesia.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Supraclavicular block (SCB) with long-acting local anaesthetic is commonly used for surgical repair of distal radial fractures (DRF). Studies have shown a risk for rebound pain when the block fades. This randomised single-centre study aimed to compare pain and opioid consumption the first three days post-surgery between SCB-mepivacaine vs. SCB-ropivacaine, with general anaesthesia (GA) as control. METHODS: Patients (n = 90) with ASA physical status 1-3 were prospectively randomised to receive; SCB with mepivacine 1{\%}, 25-30 ml (n = 30), SCB with ropivacaine 0.5{\%}, 25-30 ml (n = 30) or GA (n = 30) with propofol/fentanyl/sevoflurane. Study objectives compared postoperative pain with Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) and sum postoperative Opioid Equivalent Consumption (OEC) during the first 3 days post-surgery between study-groups. RESULTS: The three groups showed significant differences in postoperative pain-profile. Mean NRS at 24 h was significantly lower for the SCB-mepivacaine group (p = 0.018). Further both median NRS and median OEC day 0 to 3 were significanly lower in the SCB-mepivacaine group as compared to the SCB-ropivacaine group during the first three days after surgery; pain NRS 1 (IQR 0.3-3.3) and 2.7 (IQR 1.3-4.2) (p = 0.017) and OEC 30 mg (IQR 10-80) and 85 mg (IQR 45-125) (p = 0.004), respectively. The GA-group was in between both in pain NRS and median sum OEC. Unplanned healthcare contacts were highest among SCB-ropivacaine patients (39.3{\%}) vs. SCB-mepivacaine patients (0{\%}) and GA-patients (3.4{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: The potential benefit of longer duration of analgesia, associated to a long-acting local anaesthetic agent, during the early postoperative course must be put in perspective of potential worse pain progression following block resolution.

	abstract = {The superiority of distinct anesthesia methods for geriatric hip fracture surgery remains unclear. We evaluated high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) with three different anesthesia methods in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. Routine blood test findings, postoperative morbidity, and mortality were assessed as secondary outcome. In total, 176 patients were randomized into desflurane (n = 60), propofol (n = 58), or spinal groups (n = 58) that received desflurane-based balanced anesthesia, propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), or spinal anesthesia, respectively. The spinal group required less intraoperative vasopressors (p < 0.001) and fluids (p = 0.006). No significant differences in HMGB1 (p(group×time) = 0.863) or IL-6 (p(group×time) = 0.575) levels were noted at baseline, postoperative day (POD) 1, or POD2. Hemoglobin, albumin, creatinine, total lymphocyte count, potassium, troponin T, and C-reactive protein were comparable among groups at all time-points. No significant differences in postoperative hospital stay, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and ventilator use among groups were observed. Postoperative pulmonary, cardiac, and neurologic complications; and in-hospital, 30-day, and 90-day mortality were not significantly different among groups (p = 0.974). In conclusion, HMGB1 and IL-6, and all secondary outcomes, were not significantly different between desflurane anesthesia, propofol TIVA, and spinal anesthesia.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since general anaesthesia invariably accompanies surgery, the contribution of each to the development of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) has been difficult to identify. METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled trial was undertaken in elderly patients undergoing extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL). Between 2005 and 2011, 2706 individuals were screened to recruit 100 eligible patients. Patients were randomly assigned to receive general or spinal anaesthesia alone. A battery of eight neuropsychological tests was administered before operation and at 7 days and 3 months after operation. The reliable change index was used to calculate the incidence of POCD. Intention-to-treat analysis was used to compare rates of POCD. RESULTS: Futility analysis led to stopping of the trial after recruitment of 100 patients. Fifty patients were randomly assigned to general anaesthesia, and 48 patients to spinal anaesthesia without sedation or postoperative opioids. At 3 months, POCD was detected in 6.8{\%} {$[$}95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.4-18.7{\%}{$]$} of patients in the general anaesthesia group and 19.6{\%} (95{\%} CI: 9.4-33.9{\%}) in the spinal group (P=0.07). At 7 days after operation, the incidence of POCD was 4.1{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0.5-14{\%}) in the general anaesthesia group and 11.9{\%} (95{\%} CI: 4.0-26.6{\%}) in the spinal group (P=0.16). CONCLUSIONS: We found no significant difference in the rates of POCD when comparing general anaesthesia with spinal anaesthesia, suggesting that the surgical or procedural process itself may contribute to the development of POCD.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of general anesthesia on the risk of incident postoperative delirium in older adults undergoing hip surgery. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of haloperidol prophylaxis for delirium clinical trial data. Predefined risk factors for delirium were assessed prior to surgery. Primary outcome was postoperative delirium. Study outcome was compared across patient groups who received either general or regional anesthesia, and for individuals receiving various perioperative medications (benzodiazepines, anticholinergics, and opioids), using multivariable logistic regression after controlling for potential confounders. Subgroup analyses based on baseline cognitive impairment and delirium risk were also undertaken. SETTING: Large medical school-affiliated general hospital in Alkmaar, the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred twenty-six adults aged 70 and older undergoing hip surgery. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative delirium (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, and Confusion Assessment Method criteria). RESULTS: Sixty participants (11.4{\%}) had incident postoperative delirium. One hundred eighty-nine (35.9{\%}) received general anesthesia, 18 (9.5{\%}) of whom developed postoperative delirium, and 337 (64.1{\%}) received regional anesthesia, 42 (12.5{\%}) of whom developed postoperative delirium (adjusted odds ratio=0.81, 95{\%} confidence interval=0.43-1.52, P=.51). Results were stratified for baseline cognitive impairment, age, acute admission, perioperative medication and other delirium risk factors. Delirium was not independently associated with specific drugs or the medication classes opioids, benzodiazepines, and anticholinergics. CONCLUSION: General anesthesia has no distinct effect on incident postoperative delirium in older adults undergoing hip surgery. This also holds for individuals suffering from cognitive impairment or who are otherwise at risk for postoperative delirium. Perioperative use of narcotics, benzodiazepines, and anticholinergic agents was not associated with incident delirium in this cohort of older adults undergoing hip surgery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hip fracture is common and morbid in elderly patients. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is also very common in these subjects undergoing surgery with an incidence which exceeds 40{\%} in some reports. To date, the evidence is ambiguous as to whether anesthetic technique may affect the patients' outcome as far as postoperative cognitive function is concerned. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the effect of general and subarachnoid (spinal) anesthesia on the development of POCD up to 30 days after surgery in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. Methods Subjects over 65 years with hip fracture undergoing surgery were recruited for this study. They were enrolled and randomized to receive either general anesthesia (GA group) or subarachnoid (spinal) anesthesia (S group). Cognitive function was assessed using a battery of neuropsychological tests undertaken preoperatively and at 30 days postoperatively. The incidence of delirium was examined during the same period and their functional status, in terms of activities of daily living was also recorded. RESULTS: A total of seventy patients, 33 men and 37 females, mean age of 76 years were analyzed. Thirty-three patients received general anesthesia (GA group) and 37 subarachnoid (spinal) anesthesia (S group). The two groups of patients were similar with respect to baseline characteristics, comorbidities and perioperative data. The results of neuropsychological testing showed that there were no significant differences between the groups in eight out of ten neurocognitive tests at baseline and 30 days after surgery. There was a statistically significant decline of the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale score in S group compared with group GA on the 30th postoperative day (p = 0.043). A significant decline was also present in Color-Word Task test in S group compared with group GA at baseline (p = 0.014) and 30 days postoperatively (p = 0.003). Postoperative delirium was present in four patients (12{\%}) for the GA group, and in 10 patients (27{\%}) for the group receiving subarachnoid anesthesia. CONCLUSION: We concluded that the choice of anesthesia modality does not appear to influence the emergence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The anesthesia procedure in tumor-type total knee arthroplasty (TKA) may contribute to systemic inflammatory response. Therefore, we aim to investigate the effectiveness and safety of general and spinal anesthesia in patients with tumor-type TKA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients with tumors around the knee undergoing primary unilateral TKA were randomly divided into the general anesthesia group (n = 13) and spinal anesthesia group (n = 12). Knee joint HSS scores and Western Ontario and McMaster University osteoarthritis index (WOMAC osteoarthritis) were recorded before surgery and 12 months after surgery. Visual analogue scale, C-reactive protein (CPR), tumor necrosis factor-α(TNF-α), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) concentration were measured preoperatively (T0), on the day of the operation (T1), and on the first day (T2) after the operation. Complications in the two groups were recorded. RESULTS: The operative time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative drainage, tourniquet time, and complication rate were not significantly different between the general anesthesia and spinal anesthesia groups (all p > 0.05). There were no significant differences in CPR (7.6 $\pm$3.1, 8.1 $\pm$4.1, 91.3 $\pm$24.2 vs. 7.1 $\pm$2.9, 7.6 $\pm$3.8, 85.1 $\pm$19.3 pg/mL, respectively), IL-8 (12.2 $\pm$6.6, 13.4 $\pm$7.3, 19.2 $\pm$10.5 vs. 11.9 $\pm$5.7, 12.9 $\pm$8.6, 22.2 $\pm$12.4 pg/mL, respectively), and TNF-α(2.5 $\pm$1.7, 2.2 $\pm$1.9, 2.8 $\pm$2.1 vs. 2.4 $\pm$1.3, 2.7 $\pm$2.1, 2.9 $\pm$1.6 pg/mL, respectively) between the two groups at T0, T1, and T2 (all p > 0.05). There were no statistical differences in pre- and postoperative HSS knee scores (39.78 $\pm$11.3, 90.24 $\pm$15.3 vs. 42.68 $\pm$12.5, 91.21 $\pm$16.3) and WOMAC indexes (49.89 $\pm$7.9, 25.12 $\pm$6.2 vs. 51.3 $\pm$8.3, 23.15 $\pm$5.3) between the two groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: General anesthesia and spinal anesthesia in patients with tumor-type TKA had the same effectiveness and safety.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To discuss over influence of two different anesthetic and analgesic methods on early cognitive function of elderly patients who received non-cardiac surgery. METHODS: Two hundred and six elderly patients who underwent non-cardiac surgery were selected as research subjects. They were randomly divided into observation group (103 cases) and control group (103 cases). Patients in observation group were given combined spinal and epidural anesthesia and epidural analgesia, while patients in control group adopted general anesthesia and intravenous analgesia. Neurological function test was carried out one day before surgery and on the 7(th) day after surgery. Moreover, changes of postoperative pain degree, neuropsychological function and cognitive function were observed and compared. RESULTS: On the 7(th) day after surgery, incidence of cognition impairment in observation group and control group was 48.50{\%} (50/103 cases) and 44.70{\%} (46/103 cases), and difference between groups had no statistical significance. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Score of observation group was much lower than control group in the 12(th), 24(th) and 48(th) h after surgery (p < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis suggested that, short education years and general surgery were independent risk factors for early cognition impairment. CONCLUSION: About 46.60{\%} elderly patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery developed cognition impairment, but influence of different anesthetic and analgesic methods on incidence of postoperative cognition impairment of elderly patients had no significant difference.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare the influence of either general (GA) or local (LA) anesthesia on the postoperative neurocognitive outcome in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in a randomized study. Therefore, we performed a subgroup analysis of the multicenter GALA study. METHODS: A total of 40 patients were enrolled and randomized to receive either LA (n = 17) or GA (n = 23) anesthesia. The indication for intraoperative shunting was based on the intraoperative cognitive performance in the LA group and on the clinical experience of the surgeon in the GA group. Outcome measurements included patient performance on a neuropsychological Trail Making Test, evaluation of patients mood using the self-report inventory BSKE, and serum levels of the neurobiochemical marker S100beta. The data were analyzed for each variable using a t-test and were presented as the mean (SD). Differences in shunt frequency were analyzed performing a chi-squared test. Group differences in the Trail Making Test, BSKE evaluation, and S100beta concentrations were derived from the analyses of covariances with repeated measurements using preoperative values as covariates. RESULTS: Compared to baseline, the S100beta concentrations increased significantly in the GA group {$[$}0.086 (0.038) vs. 0.061 (0.024) microg/l; p < 0.001{$]$} before unclamping of the carotid artery, whereas there were no changes in the LA group {$[$}0.068 (0.024) microg/l, p = 0.09 vs. 0.061 (0.021) microg/l, p = 0.09). Furthermore, we detected significant group differences after surgical intervention (GA 0.087 (0.031) microg/l; LA 0.06 (0.021) microg/l; p = 0.006). The postoperative neurocognitive performance in the Trail Making Test decreased significantly in the GA group, whereas there were no significant changes in the LA group. The self-report inventory BSKE evaluation revealed no significant group differences. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that performing local anesthesia in patients undergoing CEA positively influenced early postoperative neurocognitive outcomes. Significant group differences in postoperative S100beta concentrations confirmed the beneficial effect of local anesthesia.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: No consensus has yet been reached regarding the best anesthetic technique for inguinal hernia repair. This study aimed to compare postoperative clinical outcomes and inflammatory markers among patients who were anesthetized using local, spinal, or general anesthesia for inguinal hernia repair. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial included patients scheduled to undergo elective unilateral inguinal hernioplasty at Siriraj Hospital during November 2014 to September 2015 study period. Patients were randomly assigned to the local (LA), spinal (SA), or general (GA) anesthesia groups. Primary outcomes were postoperative pain at rest and on mobilization at 8 and 24 hours after surgery. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients were included, with 18 patients randomly assigned to each group. Patient demographic and clinical characteristics were similar among groups. There were no significant differences among groups for postoperative pain at rest or on mobilization at 8 and 24 hours after surgery. No significant differences were observed for interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and interleukin-10 at any time points in any groups. Patients with local anesthesia was associated with less time spent in anesthesia (p = 0.010) and surgery (p = 0.009), lower intraoperative cost (p = 0.003) and total cost in hospital (p = 0.036); however, patient satisfaction in the local anesthesia group (94/100) was statistically significantly lower than the spinal and general anesthesia groups (100/100) (p = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: No statistically significant difference was observed among groups for postoperative pain scores, duration of hospital stays, complications, or change in inflammatory markers. However, time spent in anesthesia and surgery, the intraoperative cost and total cost for hernia repair, and patient satisfaction were significantly lower in the local anesthesia group than in the other two groups.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intravertebral and general anesthesia (GA) are two main anesthesia approaches but both have defects. This study was aimed to evaluate the effect of subarachnoid anesthesia combined with propofol target-controlled infusion (TCI) on blood loss and transfusion for total hip arthroplasty (THA) in elderly patients in comparison with combined spinal-epidural anesthesia (CSEA) or GA. METHODS: Totally, 240 patients (aged ≥65 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists {$[$}ASA{$]$} I-III) scheduled for posterior THA were enrolled from September 1st, 2017 to March 1st, 2018. All cases were randomly divided into three groups to receive CSEA (group C, n = 80), GA (group G, n = 80), or subarachnoid anesthesia and propofol TCI (group T, n = 80), respectively. Primary outcomes measured were intra-operative blood loss, autologous and allogeneic blood transfusion, mean arterial pressure at different time points, length of stay in post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), length of hospital stay, and patient satisfaction degree. Furthermore, post-operative pain scores and complications were also observed. The difference of quantitative index between groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, repeated measurement generalized linear model, Student-Newman-Keuls test or rank-sum test, while ratio index was analyzed by Chi-square test or Fisher exact test. RESULTS: Basic characteristics were comparable among the three groups. Intra-operative blood loss in group T (331.53 $\pm$64.33 mL) and group G (308.03 $\pm$64.90 mL) were significantly less than group C (455.40 $\pm$120.48 mL, F = 65.80, P < 0.001). Similarly, the autologous transfusion of group T (130.99 $\pm$30.36 mL) and group G (124.09 $\pm$24.34 mL) were also markedly less than group C (178.31 $\pm$48.68 mL, F = 52.99, P < 0.001). The allogenetic blood transfusion of group C (0 {$[$}0, 100.00{$]$}) was also significantly larger than group T (0) and group G (0) (Z = 2.47, P = 0.047). Except for the baseline, there were significant differences in mean arterial blood pressures before operation (F = 496.84, P < 0.001), 10-min after the beginning of operation (F = 351.43, P < 0.001), 30-min after the beginning of operation (F = 559.89, P < 0.001), 50-min after the beginning of operation (F = 374.74, P < 0.001), and at the end of operation (F = 26.14, P < 0.001) among the three groups. Length of stay in PACU of group T (9.41 $\pm$1.19 min) was comparable with group C (8.83 $\pm$1.26 min), and both were significantly shorter than group G (16.55 $\pm$3.10 min, F = 352.50, P < 0.001). There were no significant differences among the three groups in terms of length of hospitalization and post-operative visual analog scale scores. Patient satisfaction degree of group T (77/80) was significantly higher than group C (66/80, χ= 7.96, P = 0.004) and G (69/80, χ= 5.01, P = 0.025). One patient complained of post-dural puncture headache and two complained of low back pain in group C, while none in group T. Incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting in group G (10/80) was significantly higher than group T (3/80, χ= 4.10, P = 0.043) and group C (2/80, χ= 5.76, P = 0.016). No deep vein thrombosis or delayed post-operative functional exercise was detected. CONCLUSIONS: Single subarachnoid anesthesia combined with propofol TCI seems to perform better than CSEA and GA for posterior THA in elderly patients, with less blood loss and peri-operative transfusion, higher patient satisfaction degree and fewer complications.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impacts of general and spinal anesthesia on short-term cognitive function and mental status in elderly patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery. STUDY DESIGN: An experimental study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Anesthetics, the Central People's Hospital of Tengzhou City, Shandong Province, China, from December 2016 to December 2017. METHODOLOGY: A total of 80 elderly patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery were selected and randomly divided into the observation group and the control group, 40 cases in each group. The observation group underwent spinal anesthesia, and the control group underwent general anaesthesia. Eye opening time, language presentation time etc.in the two groups were compared. RESULTS: The eye opening time and language presentation time in observation group were all lower than those in control group (both p<0.001). At 1, 3 and 6 hours after surgery, the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores and the amplitudes of the P300 wave of observation group were all higher than those of the control group (all p<0.001), the latencies of the P300 wave in observation group were all lower than control group (all p<0.001). At 24h after surgery, the number of cases suffering postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in the observation group was lower than that of the control group (p=0.039). CONCLUSION: Compared with general anaesthesia, spinal anesthesia can effectively shorten the eye opening time and language presentation time in elderly patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery. It also has few impacts on the short-term cognitive function and mental status of such patients, with lower incidence of POCD.},
