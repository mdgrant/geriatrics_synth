	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intravenous and inhalation anesthesia are commonly used in the clinical setting. Recovery of cognitive function in elderly patients after surgery has received increased attention. In this study, the authors compared recovery of cognitive function in patients after different anesthesia techniques, and investigated which technique is safer. The authors also explored association between apolipoprotein E4 and postoperative cognitive dysfunction in patients undergoing general anesthesia. METHODS: A total of 2,000 patients were equally and randomly divided into intravenous and inhalation anesthesia groups. Total intravenous and inhalation anesthesia were used. Within 10 days after surgery, cognitive function was assessed daily using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Restriction fragment length polymorphism of apolipoprotein E gene was analyzed. The primary outcome was MMSE score, frequency distribution of apolipoprotein E alleles and genotypes. P < 0.01 was used as statistically significant. RESULTS: MMSE score in inhalation preoperative baseline group significantly decreased at day 3 after surgery compared with the preoperational and intravenous anesthesia group. The proportion of patients scoring less than 25 points was significantly greater in the inhalation anesthesia group than in the intravenous anesthesia group at 3 days after surgery. In the inhalation anesthesia group, the decrease in MMSE score was closely related with apolipoprotein E ε4 allele. In the intravenous anesthesia group, the decrease in MMSE score was not correlated with apolipoprotein E ε4 allele. CONCLUSIONS: There was a strong association between the apolipoprotein E ε4 and postoperative cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients undergoing inhalation anesthetics.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common and disturbing postoperative complication that might be ameliorated by propofol-based anaesthesia. We therefore tested the primary hypothesis that there is less delirium after propofol-based than after sevoflurane-based anaesthesia within 7 days of major cancer surgery. METHODS: This multicentre randomised trial was conducted in 14 tertiary care hospitals in China. Patients aged 65-90 yr undergoing major cancer surgery were randomised to either propofol-based anaesthesia or to sevoflurane-based anaesthesia. The primary endpoint was the incidence of delirium within 7 postoperative days. RESULTS: A total of 1228 subjects were enrolled and randomised, with 1195 subjects included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis (mean age 71 yr; 422 {$[$}35{\%}{$]$} women); one subject died before delirium assessment. Delirium occurred in 8.4{\%} (50/597) of subjects given propofol-based anaesthesia vs 12.4{\%} (74/597) of subjects given sevoflurane-based anaesthesia (relative risk 0.68 {$[$}95{\%} confidence interval {\{}CI{\}}: 0.48-0.95{$]$}; P=0.023; adjusted relative risk 0.59 {$[$}95{\%} CI: 0.39-0.90{$]$}; P=0.014). Delirium reduction mainly occurred on the first day after surgery, with a prevalence of 5.4{\%} (32/597) with propofol anaesthesia vs 10.7{\%} (64/597) with sevoflurane anaesthesia (relative risk 0.50 {$[$}95{\%} CI: 0.33-0.75{$]$}; P=0.001). Secondary endpoints, including ICU admission, postoperative duration of hospitalisation, major complications within 30 days, cognitive function at 30 days and 3 yr, and safety outcomes, did not differ significantly between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium was a third less common after propofol than sevoflurane anaesthesia in older patients having major cancer surgery. Clinicians might therefore reasonably select propofol-based anaesthesia in patients at high risk of postoperative delirium.

	abstract = {Introduction: In this study we aimed to compare the recovery characteristics of propofol/remifentanil and sevofluran/remifentanil anesthesia in 100 geriatric patients undergo-ing urological procedures. Materials and Method: The patients were randomized to receive either propofol-remifen-tanil (group P) or sevoflurane-remifentanil (Group S) anesthesia. Recovery characteristics, the time to post-anesthetic discharge scoring system (PADSS) score and Aldrete score of 9 point, Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) and Trieger Dot Test (TDT)values were compared between two groups. Results: Extubation time was significantly shorter in group P than in group S (5.3+2.9 min vs 7.8+3.8 min, p=0.038). The times of first eye opening, response to verbal commands and ori-entation were similar in both groups. The time of Aldrete score of 9 points (grup P: 14.2+3.6 min, group S: 16.3+4.5 min) and PADSS of 9 points (group P: 19.3+5.7 min, group S: 22.1+4.2 min) were also similar (p{$>$}0.05). Time to return to the normal value of DSST was significantly shorter in Group P compared with Group S, and TDT was similar in both groups (p{$>$}0.05). No sig-nificant differences were observed in the incidence of postoperative complications and VAS score (p{$>$}0.05). Conclusion: Both propofol-remifentanil and sevoflurane-remifentanil appears to be an ade-quate anesthesia in geriatric patients.},

	abstract = {Study designsRetrospective Observational StudyObjectives: To compare the incidence of POD after propofol- and sevoflurane-based anesthesia in elderly patients undergoing spine surgery.MethodsIn this study, the medical records of elderly patients ≥65 years of age who underwent spine surgery under total intravenous anesthesia with propofol or inhalational anesthesia with sevoflurane were reviewed. The primary outcome was the incidence of POD after propofol- and sevoflurane-based anesthesia. Secondary outcomes included postoperative 30-day complications, length of postoperative hospital stay, associations of patient characteristics, and surgery- and anesthesia-related data with the development of POD, and associations of anesthetics with clinical outcomes such as postoperative 30-day complications, and length of postoperative hospital stay.ResultsOf the 281 patients, POD occurred in 29 patients (10.3{\%}). POD occurred more frequently in the sevoflurane group than in the propofol group (15.7{\%} vs. 5.0{\%}, respectively; P=.003). The multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that sevoflurane-based anesthesia was associated with an increased risk of POD compared with propofol-based anesthesia (odds ratio {$[$}OR{$]$}, 4.120; 95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$}, 1.549?10.954; P = .005), whereas anesthetics were not associated with postoperative 30-day complications and the length of postoperative hospital stay. Older age (OR, 1.242 CI, 1.130?1.366; P < .001) and higher mean pain score at postoperative day 1 (OR, 1.338 CI, 1.056?1.696; P = .016) were also associated with an increased risk of POD.ConclusionsPropofol-based anesthesia was associated with a lower incidence of POD than sevoflurane-based anesthesia in elderly patients after spine surgery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To determine whether the anesthetic method of propofol total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) is associated with postoperative outcome in ESRD patients, we evaluated the incidence of postoperative major adverse cardiac events (MACE), comparing propofol TIVA versus anesthesia with volatile anesthesia in ESRD patients. METHODS: Retrospectively, we identified cases with ESRD patients who underwent surgery under general anesthesia. Patients were divided into those who received only volatile anesthesia (volatile group) and those who received only propofol TIVA (TIVA group). The incidence of MACE and potential confounding variables were compared separately in a univariate logistic model and subsequently by multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Among the 2576 cases in ESRD patients, 1374 were in the TIVA group and 1202 were in the volatile group. The multivariate analysis included 12 factors, including the anesthesia method, of which five factors were significant. Factors that were associated with a significantly lower MACE risk included preoperative chloride concentration (OR: 0.96; 95{\%} CI, 0.92-0.99), baseline SBP (OR: 0.98; 95{\%} CI, 0.98-0.99), and propofol TIVA (OR: 0.37; 95{\%} CI, 0.22-0.60). CONCLUSIONS: We inferred that the anesthetic method associated with the postoperative outcome in patients with ESRD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Volatile anesthesia possesses cardioprotective properties, and it is widely used in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, but no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are available on the use of sevoflurane-remifentanil versus propofol-remifentanil anesthesia for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) during noncardiac surgery. This study was designed to compare the 2 different types of general anesthesia in patients with CAD undergoing noncardiac surgery at a single center. MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients with CAD undergoing noncardiac surgery were enrolled in an RCT conducted between March 2016 and December 2017. The participants were randomized to receive either sevoflurane-remifentanil or propofol-remifentanil anesthesia. The primary endpoint was occurrence of in-hospital cardiovascular events. The secondary endpoints included delirium, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), Intensive Care Unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), in-hospital morbidity and mortality, and hospital LOS. RESULTS A total of 164 participants completed the study (sevoflurane: 81; propofol: 83). The occurrence of in-hospital cardiovascular events did not differ between the 2 groups (42.6{\%} vs 39.4{\%}, P=0.86). The occurrence of delirium did not differ between the 2 groups after the operation. PONV had a higher frequency after sevoflurane anesthesia at 48 h compared with propofol. In-hospital morbidity and mortality, ICU LOS, and hospital LOS were similar between the 2 groups (all P>0.05). At 30 days after surgery, no between-group differences in cardiac morbidity and mortality were observed. CONCLUSIONS In this study, anesthesia using sevoflurane-remifentanil did not provide additional postoperative cardioprotection in comparison with propofol-remifentanil in patients with CAD undergoing noncardiac surgery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (PD) is a prevalent complication of elderly surgical patients, which predisposes to worsened cognitive recovery and dementia. Risk of PD has been associated with increasing magnitude of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal stress response (serum cortisol, epinephrine and norepinephrine) to surgery. Anesthetics suppress this response; however, some (total intravenous anesthesia, TIVA) more than others (anesthetic gases). Prior comparisons of anesthetics have been equivocal but have not included stress markers. We hypothesized that TIVA would decrease serum stress markers and the incidence of PD. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of 76 elderly major surgical patients. Patients received TIVA or sevoflurane gas, and blood was drawn for serum markers pre-, intra-, and postoperatively. PD was assessed with the Confusion Assessment Method. We compared stress markers and PD between patients who received TIVA versus sevoflurane, and then modeled PD including stress and anesthetic. RESULTS: The group that received TIVA during surgery demonstrated lower levels of all stress markers compared to the gas group, but no difference in PD. However, across groups, the postoperative norepinephrine level was much higher in patients who developed PD. Other markers and other times had no effect. CONCLUSION: The development of PD depends more on postoperative stress than intraoperative stress or anesthetic.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a serious and costly complication of the elderly; even mild impairment has the potential to impact overall well being. Anesthesiologists continue to search for ways to manipulate intraoperative technique to optimize postoperative cognition in the elderly. Depth of anesthesia during surgery is an area that has shown some promise for short-term outcomes, such as delirium. However, excessive depth has both positive and negative associations with longer-term POCD. We hypothesize that this uncertainty is due to the inability of median depth to capture the amount of burst suppression or electrical silence. In this study, our purpose was to identify the intraoperative processed EEG parameters that are most closely correlated with POCD. METHODS: To explore the association of several processed EEG parameters with POCD, we performed a retrospective analysis of a cohort of 105 patients aged >68 years scheduled for major surgery under general anesthesia. Intraoperative medications, hemodynamics, processed EEG and cerebral oxygen saturation were recorded. All patients had a cognitive battery before surgery and repeated at 3 months afterward. FINDINGS: One hundred and five patients enrolled and 77 (73.3{\%}) patients completed the 3-month cognitive testing. The incidence of POCD was 27{\%}; the median Bispectral Index value for patients who developed POCD was similar to patients who did not (46 vs 42 minutes). However, patients who developed POCD spent less time with Bispectral Index <45 minutes (82.8 vs 122.5 minutes, P = 0.01) and burst suppression (35 vs 96 minutes, P = 0.04). Hypotension, cerebral desaturation, and use of total intravenous anesthesia were similar between patients with and without POCD. IMPLICATIONS: Patients who developed POCD spent less time in EEG burst suppression and less time in deep states. Burst suppression may be protective for POCD. Further work is needed to definitively identify the role of burst suppression in the context of other patient and intraoperative variables to prevent POCD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is one of the main causes of morbidity after noncardiac surgery; however, the pathogenic mechanisms of POCD have remained unclear until now. In this study, we performed a pilot study to investigate the association between apolipoprotein E (ApoE) epsilon4 and POCD in older patients undergoing intravenous anesthesia (IVA) and inhalation anesthesia (IAA). METHODS: In total, 180 patients from Shenzhen People's Hospital were recruited and randomly divided into an IVA group and an IAA group. The IVA group and IAA group received propofol and sevoflurane treatment, respectively. Within 7 days after surgery, the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) was used daily to assess the cognitive function of both groups of patients. The genotypes of the ApoE gene were detected using the restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. In addition, the serum levels of (soluble protein-100beta) S100beta and (Interleukin- 6) L6 were also analyzed. RESULTS: Compared to the preoperative and IVA groups, the MMSE score in the IAA group significantly decreased at 3 days after surgery. Furthermore, the IAA group had a higher percentage of patients who scored less than 25 points than the IVA group at 3 days after surgery. The decrease in the MMSE score was closely related to the ApoE epsilon4 allele in the IAA group, but this correlation was not observed in the IVA group. The levels of S100beta and IL6 were increased sharply in patients with the epsilon4/epsilon4 genotype who received IAA compared with IVA at 1 day after surgery. CONCLUSION: The results of the study indicated that the ApoEpsilon epsilon4/epsilon4 genotype was a risk factor for early POCD in older patients undergoing sevoflurane anesthesia.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: One-lung ventilation (OLV) may impair cerebral oxygen balance and induce postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). It is unclear whether the type of anesthetic influences the incidence of POCD in patients undergoing OLV. This prospective study compared the incidence of POCD and intraoperative cerebral oxygen desaturation in OLV patients anesthetized with propofol vs sevoflurane during lung surgery. METHODS: There were 148 participants enrolled in this study and randomized equally to either the propofol or the sevoflurane group. Anesthesia was maintained with either propofol or sevoflurane combined in both groups with fentanyl and epidural anesthesia. Regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2), jugular bulb venous oxygen saturation (SjO2), and the incidence of cerebral oxygen desaturation (rSO2 or SjO2 < 50{\%} or rSO2 < 80{\%} of baseline) were measured during anesthesia. Cognitive function was assessed using seven neurocognitive tests two days preoperatively, five days postoperatively (primary outcome), and three months postoperatively. Bivariable and multivariable regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with POCD. RESULTS: Rates of POCD did not differ statistically between groups five days postoperatively (propofol, 16/72 patients; sevoflurane, 24/72 patients; RR, 0.67; 95{\%} CI, 0.39 to 1.15; P = 0.14) or three months postoperatively (propofol, 9/60 patients; sevoflurane, 12/58 patients; RR, 0.73; 95{\%} CI, 0.33 to 1.59; P = 0.42). Only three subjects per group showed intraoperative cerebral oxygen desaturation. Multivariable regression analysis revealed older age as an independent predictor of POCD. CONCLUSIONS: No statistically significant difference in the incidence of POCD could be detected between the sevoflurane and propofol anesthesia groups. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction was relatively frequent following OLV in both groups. ( REGISTRATION NUMBER: UMIN 000002826).},

METHODS: One-hundred and twenty-four patients undergoing cataract surgery were randomized to either a propofol/remifentanil or an isoflurane/fentanyl group. In the propofol/remifentanil group, both drugs were used for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia; in the isoflurane/fentanyl group, anaesthesia was induced with etomidate and fentanyl and maintained with isoflurane and fentanyl. All patients received mivacurium for muscle relaxation and the lungs were ventilated mechanically. The use of propofol and remifentanil resulted in a faster emergence and an overall savings per case of {$[$}symbol: see text{$]$} 12.25 due to a reduction in personnel costs which outweighs the higher drug acquisition costs. RESULTS: In the propofol and remifentanil group, more patients were satisfied and would accept the same anaesthetic again. CONCLUSION: We conclude that propofol and remifentanil is more cost-effective than isoflurane/fentanyl due to its better recovery profile, reduced total direct costs and higher patient satisfaction.},

	abstract = {The present prospective randomized study was designed to investigate whether the development of Post Operative Cognitive Decline (POCD) is related to anesthesia type in older adults. All patients were screened for delirium and mental status, received baseline neuropsychological assessment, and evaluation of activities of daily living (ADLs). Follow-up assessments were performed at 3-6 months and 12-18 months. Patients were randomized to receive either inhalation anesthesia (ISO) with isoflurane or total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with propofol for maintenance anesthesia. ISO (n = 99) and TIVA (n = 100) groups were similar in demographics, preoperative cognition, and incidence of post-operative delirium. Groups did not differ in terms of mean change in memory or executive function from baseline to follow-up. Pre-surgical cognitive function is the only variable predictive of the development of POCD. Anesthetic type was not predictive of POCD. However, ADLs were predictive of post-operative delirium development. Overall, this pilot study represents a prospective, randomized study demonstrating that when examining ISO versus TIVA for maintenance of general anesthesia, there is no significant difference in cognition between anesthetic types. There is also no difference in the occurrence of postoperative delirium. Postoperative cognitive decline was best predicted by lower baseline cognition and functional status.},

	abstract = {Background: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common complication after surgery. The present study compared the effects of sevoflurane and propofol on POCD in old patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery under general anesthesia. Methods: Sixty patients over 65-year-old candidates for elective laparotomy were randomly assigned into two groups of anesthesia with sevoflurane or propofol. Baseline assessment of cognitive function was done 12-24 hours before surgery and the second to fourth tests were done at 6-12, 18-24, and 42-48 hours after surgery, respectively. Results: The mean age, gender and the mean time of surgery were equal in two groups. Postoperative cognitive function in sevoflurane group was significantly better than propofol group in the 6-12 (p<0.03) and 12-24 (p<0.03) hours after surgery but the assessment of the two groups in 24-48 hours after surgery showed similar conditions. Discussion: The results of this study showed that anesthesia with sevoflurane creates less cognitive disorders than anesthesia with propofol in patients without cerebrovascular complications or surgical procedures that involve the brain's blood flow. {\copyright}2017, American University of Beirut.

	abstract = {AIM: The aim of this randomized clinical trial was to compare patients treated using a multimodal approach {$[$}enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS){$]$}, with a special focus on counselling, to patients treated in a standard conventional care pathway, who underwent elective colorectal resection. METHOD: In a single-centre trial, adult patients eligible for open or laparoscopic colorectal resection were randomized to an ERAS programme or standard care. The primary end-point was postoperative total hospital stay. Identical discharge criteria were defined for both treatment groups. Secondary end-points included postoperative complications, postoperative C-reactive protein levels, postoperative hospital stay, readmission rate and mortality. All parameters were recorded before operation, on the day of surgery and daily thereafter until discharge. RESULTS: Total hospital stay was significantly shorter among patients randomized to ERAS than among the standard group {$[$}median 5 days (range 2-50 days) vs median 8 days (range 2-48 days); P = 0.001{$]$}. The two treatment groups exhibited similar outcomes regarding overall major and minor morbidity, reoperation rate, readmission rate and 30-day mortality. There were also no differences in tolerance of enteral nutrition or in the inflammatory response, as reflected by postoperative C-reactive protein levels. CONCLUSION: ERAS care was associated with a significantly shorter length of hospital stay. Without any difference in surgical or general complications, tolerance of enteral nutrition or postoperative C-reactive protein levels, peri-operative information and guidance for ensuring that patients comply with the ERAS approach appear to be important factors to reduce the length of hospital stay.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in elderly surgical patients (>60years) receiving different anesthetics (propofol, sevoflurane, or isoflurane) and to identify potential biomarkers of POCD in this patient population. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial. SETTING: University-affiliated teaching hospital. PATIENTS: One hundred and fifty elderly patients scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. INTERVENTIONS: Elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomly assigned to receive propofol, sevoflurane, or isoflurane anesthesia. MEASUREMENTS: Cognitive function was assessed using neuropsychological tests at baseline (1day before surgery {$[$}D0{$]$}), and on postoperative day 1 (D1) and day 3 (D3). Plasma S-100beta and Abeta(1-40) protein, IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha concentrations were assessed before induction of anesthesia (T0), after extubation (T1), and 1h (T2) and 24h (T3) postoperatively. MAIN RESULTS: The incidence of POCD was significantly lower in the propofol group compared to the isoflurane group and the sevoflurane group at D1 and D3 (propofol vs. isoflurane: D1 and D3, P<0.001; propofol vs. sevoflurane: D1, P=0.012; D3, P=0.013). The incidence of POCD was significantly lower in the sevoflurane group compared to the isoflurane group at D1 (P=0.041), but not at D3. Postoperatively, plasma S-100beta and Abeta(1-40) protein, IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha concentrations were significantly decreased in the propofol group compared to the isoflurane group. CONCLUSIONS: Propofol anesthesia may be an option for elderly surgical patients.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Investigate the effect of volatile anesthesia versus total intravenous anesthesia on the incidence of postoperative delirium and length of stay in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement under general anesthesia. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Single institution, academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement under general anesthesia between November 2014 and February 2017. INTERVENTIONS: This study was not an interventional study. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Electronic medical records were reviewed for intraoperative maintenance anesthetic technique, hospital and intensive care unit length of stay, 30-day mortality, and documentation of delirium. Delirium was defined as either 1) positive Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit score or 2) documentation of delirium or confusion by the care team within 2 days of surgery. Overall, 116 patients were included and 84 (72{\%}) received a total intravenous anesthesia technique. Twenty-three patients (20{\%}) had postoperative delirium. The odds of delirium were lower in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement with total intravenous anesthesia, compared with volatile anesthesia, even after adjusting for procedure approach (odds ratio 0.22, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.06, 0.79, p = 0.02). No significant difference in hospital or intensive care unit length of stay was seen after adjusting for procedural characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: While postoperative delirium is a complex and multifactorial problem, the type of general anesthetic maintenance may contribute to the incidence of postoperative delirium in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement, and total intravenous anesthesia may be an attractive alternative to volatile-based general anesthesia maintenance.},

	abstract = {Background: Postoperative complications are common after colorectal surgery, and possibly related to the type of anaesthesia. We aimed to determine associations between the type of anaesthesia and complications after colorectal cancer surgery using Danish registries. Methods: Patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery (2004--18) were identified in the Danish Colorectal Cancer Group Database. The cohort was enriched with the Danish Anaesthesia Database and Danish National Prescription Registry data linked by Danish Central Person Registration number. Patients were classified according to type of general anaesthesia: inhalation or TIVA. Confounders were adjusted by propensity score matching. The primary outcome was complications within 30 days postoperatively. Secondarily, we assessed specific medical and surgical complications. Results: We identified 22 179 individuals undergoing colorectal cancer surgery with accompanying anaesthesia data. Propensity score matching yielded 8722 individuals per group. After propensity score matching, postoperative complications were seen in 1933 (22.2{\%}) patients undergoing inhalation anaesthesia and in 2199 (25.2{\%}) undergoing TIVA (odds ratio {$[$}OR{$]$}=0.84; 95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$}, 0.79--0.91). Although no difference was observed for medical complications, 1369 (15.7{\%}) undergoing inhalation anaesthesia had surgical complications compared with 1708 (19.6{\%}) undergoing TIVA (OR=0.76; 95{\%} CI, 0.71--0.83). Rates of wound dehiscence, anastomotic leak, ileus, wound abscess, intra-abdominal abscess, and sepsis were statistically significantly lower in the inhalation anaesthesia group. Conclusion: In this propensity score-matched registry study, use of inhalation anaesthesia was associated with fewer postoperative complications after colorectal cancer surgery than use of TIVA. Inhalation anaesthesia was associated with fewer complications related to wound healing and surgical infections.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Our study aimed to determine the impact of a novel technique of anesthesia administration on the clinical outcomes and complications in geriatric patients with severe systemic disease undergoing hip surgery. METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients aged > 65 years with severe systemic disease that was a constant of life {$[$}American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) IV{$]$} who underwent surgery for hip fracture between January 2018 and January 2020. The patients were divided into two groups: Group I {$[$}fascia iliaca compartment block plus propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia (FICB + TIVA){$]$} and Group II {$[$}general anesthesia (GA){$]$}. The primary outcomes were 30-day and 1-year mortality. The secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, postoperative morbidity, Visual Analog Scale score, and consumption of analgesics. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the 30-day mortality (5 vs. 3.8{\%}, p = 0.85) and 1-year mortality (15 vs. 12{\%}, p = 0.73) between the groups. Group I had significantly lower ICU requirements (p = 0.01) and shorter lengths of ICU stay (p < 0.001) and hospital stay (p < 0.001). Moreover, a smaller proportion of patients in Group I required postoperative morphine or oral opiates. CONCLUSION: Geriatric patients who underwent hip surgery under FICB + TIVA required fewer ICU admissions, shorter lengths of ICU and hospital stay, and had lesser postoperative opioid consumption than those who were under GA. Hence, we recommend the novel FICB + TIVA technique for hip fracture surgery in geriatric patients with poor general health status and high surgical risks (ASA IV).},

@article{234,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the possible cardioprotective effect of sevoflurane versus propofol anesthesia in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. METHODS: Ten thousand five hundred thirty-five consecutive single cardiac surgical procedures from 3 cardiac centers were reported to a common registry from 1999 to 2005. The registry was established by the National Board of Health, and reporting was obligatory for all public heart centers in Denmark. The patients were stratified according to preoperative risk factors (EuroSCORE parameters). The outcome parameters were 30-day mortality, the incidence of postoperative myocardial infarction, and the incidence of postoperative arrhythmias. RESULTS: Overall, the 30-day mortality was lower after sevoflurane (2.84{\%}) versus propofol (3.30{\%}), although not significantly so (p = 0.18). No difference was found in the incidence of postoperative myocardial infarction (sevoflurane, 7.76{\%}/propofol, 7.47{\%}). Patients with preoperative unstable angina and/or recent myocardial infarction, and thus already "preconditioned," did not show any difference in mortality between anesthetic groups, whereas patients without these predictors showed a lower postoperative mortality after sevoflurane (2.28{\%} v 3.14{\%}, p = 0.015), which can at least partly be explained by a preconditioning-like effect. The data suggest that patients suffering relatively severe preoperative ischemic stress benefited from propofol anesthesia, which can be related to the antioxidant effects of propofol. Patients in the sevoflurane group had a higher incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation (28.75{\%} v 24.87{\%}, p < 0.001), whereas patients in the propofol group showed a higher incidence of all other arrhythmias. CONCLUSION: Sevoflurane and propofol both possess some, although different, cardioprotective properties. Sevoflurane appears to be superior to propofol in patients with little or no ischemic heart disease, such as noncoronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and CABG surgery without severe preoperative ischemia, whereas propofol seems superior in patients with severe ischemia, cardiovascular instability, or in acute/urgent surgery.},

	abstract = {This study compares remifentanil/propofol (remi/prop) with isoflurane/fentanyl (iso/fen) anesthesia to determine which provides the greater hemodynamic stability, lesser myocardial ischemia, and morbidity with better postoperative outcomes after carotid endarterectomy. Sixty patients undergoing unilateral carotid endarterectomy were randomized to receive either a remi/prop or iso/fen anesthetic. Hemodynamic variables were recorded during the surgical procedure. In addition, transesophageal echocardiography was used to assess evidence of intraoperative regional wall motion abnormalities suggestive of cardiac ischemia. Emergence and extubation times, recovery from anesthesia, hemodynamic instability, nausea, vomiting, and pain in post anesthesia recovery, discharge delays, ICU admittance, hospital discharge, and preoperative and postoperative troponin levels were compared using appropriate statistical methods with P < 0.05 considered significant. The groups were demographically alike. Hemodynamic variables were similar during intubation and throughout surgery. Twenty-two percent of patients receiving iso/fen developed intraoperative regional wall motion abnormalities suggestive of ischemia, whereas no remi/prop patients had changes (P < 0.05). There was no difference in ST-T wave changes after surgery, and no patient had an elevation in troponin I levels. Postoperative variables were similar except that patients who received iso/fen had lower Stewart recovery scores during the first 15 minutes after post anesthesia care unit admission and a higher incidence of nausea and vomiting the day after surgery, whereas patients receiving remi/prop had discharge delays secondary to hypertension. ICU admittance, time to first void, oral intake, and time to hospital discharge were similar between the groups. At 9 times the cost of an iso/fen anesthesia technique, remi/prop offers little advantage over inhalational anesthesia for carotid endarterectomy.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to retrospectively examine whether sevoflurane anesthesia had any ameliorative effects on postoperative cognitive dysfunction in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Methods: One hundred and nine patients underwent elective CABG surgery at our institution from May 1999 to May 2001. From May 1999 to August 2000, the main anesthetic regime used included a propofol infusion with no volatile anesthetic being administered during the surgery. From September 2000 to May 2001, the main anesthetic regime used was 1.5{\%}-2.0{\%} sevoflurane from the postinduction period until the end of the surgery. All patients underwent a battery of neurological and neuropsychological tests 1 day before and 6 months after the operation. Results: The use of sevoflurane did not have any significant effects onthe postoperative levels of cognitive dysfunction. In contrast, multiple logistic analysis showed that age {$[$}odds ratio (OR), 1.3; P = 0.047{$]$}, diabetes mellitus (OR, 2.5; P = 0.03), and atherosclerosis of the ascending aorta (OR, 1.4; P = 0.047) appeared to be predictive factors of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Conclusion: This retrospective study showed no relationship between postoperative cognitive dysfunction and the use of sevoflurane. {\copyright}JSA 2007.},

	abstract = {Objective: To examine the antioxidant role of propofol in ischemia-reperfusion during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and its influence on cognitive dysfunction after CEA. Design: A randomized prospective study. Setting: Single-center study in a university hospital. Participants: Forty-four patients. Interventions: Patients underwent elective CEA under general anesthesia with either sevoflurane (group S, n = 21) or propofol (group P, n = 23). Measurements and Main Results: Cognitive function was assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) before CEA, 1 hour after CEA, and 24 hours after CEA. Blood samples from the radial artery and the internal jugular vein were drawn before carotid clamping and 5 minutes following unclamping, and peripheral blood was obtained 24 hours postoperatively. Samples were analyzed for lactate, S100B, and P-selectin concentrations and for the antioxidative markers malondialdehyde/low-density lipoprotein ratio and nitrate + nitrite concentrations. Compared with group S, patients in group P exhibited a greater increase in their MMSE values 24 hours postoperatively. Patients who had their MMSE performance reduced at 24 hours also were significantly fewer in group P (13{\%} v 43{\%} in group S, p<0.05). Significantly lower levels of lactate and S100B were observed in arterial and jugular vein samples in group P. In addition, the jugular vein-arterial differences of malondialdehyde-to-low- density lipoprotein ratio and nitrates + nitrites concentrations were lower during propofol anesthesia. Conclusions: Propofol seemed to improve cognitive performance after CEA. This improvement was associated with decreased indices of ischemic cerebral damage and seemed to be due to antioxidative effect in the ischemic cerebral circulation. {\copyright}2013 Elsevier Inc.},

This study was performed to compare the postoperative quality of recovery according to the method of anesthesia administered among patients undergoing OPCAB using the Korean version of the Quality of Recovery-40 (QoR-40K) questionnaire. This single-blind, prospective study (trial number: KCT0004726) was performed using a population of 102 patients undergoing OPCAB under general anesthesia. The patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups using a computer-generated list: a total intravenous anesthesia group (Group T) and a balanced anesthesia group (Group B). The QoR-40K score was measured preoperatively and at 24 and 48 h after extubation. There was no significant difference in the QoR-40K scores between the groups at 24 and 48 h after extubation. In addition, there were no significant differences between groups with respect to any of the five dimensions of QoR-40K at 24 and 48 h after extubation. Finally, there were no differences in the postoperative opioid consumption, time to extubation, or length of hospital stay. In this study, there was no difference in the QoR-40K score at 24 h after extubation between Groups T and B. Therefore, both methods of anesthesia are suitable for use when performing OPCAB.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Periprosthetic joint infection is a serious complication of total knee arthroplasty. Though there are many factors that might increase its risk, the use of propofol for maintaining general anesthesia could theoretically increase the incidence of infection because of its lipid component that supports bacterial growth. Nevertheless, the relationship between anesthetic maintenance agents and the occurrence of periprosthetic joint infection remains uncertain. The purpose of this study was to compare the incidence of suspected early-onset periprosthetic joint infection between patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty under propofol vs sevoflurane anesthesia. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients in the national inpatient Diagnosis Procedure Combination database in Japan who underwent total knee arthroplasty. Suspected periprosthetic joint infection was surrogately defined as the need for arthrocentesis or debridement within 30 days of surgery. Propensity score matching was performed between patients who received either propofol or sevoflurane for anesthetic maintenance to determine the proportion of those with infection. RESULTS: Eligible patients (n = 21,899) were categorized into either the propofol (n = 7,439) or sevoflurane (n = 14,460) groups. In the 5,140 propensity-matched patient pairs, there was no significant difference in the proportion of arthrocentesis or debridement {$[$}1.3{\%} propofol vs 1.7{\%} sevoflurane; respectively (relative risk, 0.76; 95{\%} CI, 0.55 to 1.04; P = 0.10){$]$} between the groups. The mean (SD) length of stay in the propofol group was significantly longer than in the sevoflurane group {$[$}32.5 (18.4) days vs 31.4 (14.4) days, respectively; mean difference, 1.1; 95{\%} CI, 0.5 to 1.8; P < 0.001{$]$}. CONCLUSION: Propensity score analysis suggested no significant association between the choice of anesthetic maintenance agent and the occurrence of suspected early-onset periprosthetic joint infection in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.},

The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of POCD in patients administered either sevoflurane or propofol for maintenance of anaesthesia during total hip replacement surgery. Following administration of a spinal anaesthetic, patients received either sevoflurane (n=121) or propofol (n=171) at the discretion of the anaesthetist for maintenance of general anaesthesia to maintain the processed electroencephalogram (bispectral index, BIS) under 60. POCD was assessed postoperatively at day 7, three months, and 12 months using a neurocognitive test battery. There was no statistically significant difference between the incidence of POCD at any timepoint with sevoflurane compared to propofol. The mean BIS was significantly lower in the sevoflurane group than in the propofol group (mean BIS 44.3 {$[$}standard deviation, SD 7.5{$]$} in the sevoflurane group versus 53.7 {$[$}SD 8.1{$]$} in the propofol group, <i>P</i>=0.0001).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anesthetic agents used for general anesthesia are emerging possible influential factors for surgical site infection (SSI). In this retrospective study, we evaluated the incidence of SSI after colorectal surgery according to the main anesthetic agents: volatile anesthetics vs. propofol. METHODS: A total 1,934 adult patients, who underwent elective colorectal surgery under general anesthesia between January 2011 and December 2013, were surveyed to evaluate the incidence of SSI: 1,519 using volatile anesthetics and 415 using propofol for main anesthetic agents. Patient, surgery, and anesthesia-related factors were investigated from all patients. Propensity-score matching was performed to reduce the risk of confounding and produced 390 patients in each group. RESULTS: Within the propensity-score matched groups, the incidence of SSI was higher in the volatile group compared with the propofol group (10 {$[$}2.6{\%}{$]$} vs. 2 {$[$}0.5{\%}{$]$}, OR = 5.0 {$[$}95{\%} CI = 1.1-2.8{$]$}). C-reactive protein was higher in the volatile group than in the propofol group (8.4 +/- 5.6 vs. 7.1 +/- 5.3 mg/dl, P = 0.001), and postoperative white blood cells count was higher in the volatile group than in the propofol group (9.2 +/- 3.2 x 10(3)/microl vs. 8.6 +/- 3.4 x 10(3)/microl, P = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that intravenous anesthesia may have beneficial effects for reducing SSI in colorectal surgery compared to volatile anesthesia.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delayed neurocognitive recovery after surgery is associated with poor outcome. Most surgeries require general anesthesia, of which sevoflurane and propofol are the most commonly used inhalational and intravenous anesthetics. The authors tested the primary hypothesis that patients with laparoscopic abdominal surgery under propofol-based anesthesia have a lower incidence of delayed neurocognitive recovery than patients under sevoflurane-based anesthesia. A second hypothesis is that there were blood biomarkers for predicting delayed neurocognitive recovery to occur. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, parallel, controlled study was performed at four hospitals in China. Elderly patients (60 yr and older) undergoing laparoscopic abdominal surgery that was likely longer than 2 h were randomized to a propofol- or sevoflurane-based regimen to maintain general anesthesia. A minimum of 221 patients was planned for each group to detect a one-third decrease in delayed neurocognitive recovery incidence in propofol group compared with sevoflurane group. The primary outcome was delayed neurocognitive recovery incidence 5 to 7 days after surgery. RESULTS: A total of 544 patients were enrolled, with 272 patients in each group. Of these patients, 226 in the propofol group and 221 in the sevoflurane group completed the needed neuropsychological tests for diagnosing delayed neurocognitive recovery, and 46 (20.8{\%}) in the sevoflurane group and 38 (16.8{\%}) in the propofol group met the criteria for delayed neurocognitive recovery (odds ratio, 0.77; 95{\%} CI, 0.48 to 1.24; P = 0.279). A high blood interleukin-6 concentration at 1 h after skin incision was associated with an increased likelihood of delayed neurocognitive recovery (odds ratio, 1.04; 95{\%} CI, 1.01 to 1.07; P = 0.007). Adverse event incidences were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Anesthetic choice between propofol and sevoflurane did not appear to affect the incidence of delayed neurocognitive recovery 5 to 7 days after laparoscopic abdominal surgery. A high blood interleukin-6 concentration after surgical incision may be an independent risk factor for delayed neurocognitive recovery.},

	abstract = {Objective: Preoperative levels of cognition-related biomarkers and intraoperative cerebral ischemia and hypoxia might cause postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction (PND). The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive ability of preoperative plasma biomarkers along with cerebral oxygen saturation (SctO(2)) for the incidence of PND in elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: A total of 210 patients aged 65-80 years undergoing spinal surgery were randomly assigned to three groups (n = 70 each): propofol, sevoflurane, and propofol/sevoflurane as anesthesia maintenance protocols. Propofol was administrated target-controlled infusion of 4 μg/ml (group P), the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of inhalation anesthetic sevoflurane was 1.3 (group S), and propofol was injected with a target-controlled plasma concentration of 1.2 μg/ml, accompanied by sevoflurane inhalation 0.7 MAC (group PS). Cognitive function was evaluated 1 day preoperatively and on the 7th day postoperatively. Preoperative levels of amyloidβ-40 (Aβ-40), Aβ-42, total tau protein (T-tau), phosphorylated tau protein (P-tau), and triggering receptors on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2) were investigated. SctO(2) was monitored intraoperatively. Results: Aβ-42 had the strongest significant correlation with preoperative MoCA score. The value of Aβ-42 associated with a high risk of PND was 28.34 pg/ml, and the area under the curve (AUC) was predicted to be 0.711. When the preoperative level of Aβ-42 was 28.34 pg/ml, SctO(2max){\%} was 9.92{\%}. The AUC was predicted to be 0.872, and the sensitivity and specificity were 0.833 and 0.841, respectively. Conclusion: Under the conditions of preoperative Aβ-42 less than 28.34 pg/ml, the intraoperative fluctuation range of cerebral oxygen saturation should be maintained within 9.92{\%} to reduce the occurrence of PND in geriatric patients with MCI.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: On the basis of data indicating that volatile anesthetics induce cardioprotection in cardiac surgery, current guidelines recommend volatile anesthetics for maintenance of general anesthesia during noncardiac surgery in hemodynamic stable patients at risk for perioperative myocardial ischemia. The aim of the current study was to compare increased troponin T (TnT) values in patients receiving sevoflurane-based anesthesia or total intravenous anesthesia in elective abdominal aortic surgery. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, open, parallel-group trial comparing sevoflurane-based anesthesia (group S) and total intravenous anesthesia (group T) with regard to cardioprotection in 193 patients scheduled for elective abdominal aortic surgery. Increased TnT level on the first postoperative day was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints were postoperative complications, nonfatal coronary events and mortality. RESULTS: On the first postoperative day increased TnT values (>13 ng/l) were found in 43 (44{\%}) patients in group S versus 41 (43{\%}) in group T (P = 0.999), with no significant differences in TnT levels between the groups at any time point. Although underpowered, the authors found no differences in postoperative complications, nonfatal coronary events or mortality between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: In elective abdominal aortic surgery sevoflurane-based anesthesia did not reduce myocardial injury, evaluated by TnT release, compared with total intravenous anesthesia. These data indicate that potential cardioprotective effects of volatile anesthetics found in cardiac surgery are less obvious in major vascular surgery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The use of propofol compared with isoflurane is associated with improved patient comfort and decreased costs. However, as the cost saving, the quicker recovery time and patient comfort may not be evident if sevoflurane is substituted for isoflurane; these two anaesthetic agents were analysed in elderly patients. METHODS: In a prospective randomized study, 96 patients undergoing elective ophthalmic surgery received either total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol (Group P), propofol for induction and sevoflurane for maintenance (Group P/S) or sevoflurane for inhalation induction and maintenance (Group S). Analyses focussed on haemodynamics, the quality of recovery, and the costs for the anaesthetic and the entire procedure. RESULTS: Bradycardia or hypotension, mainly registered in Groups P and P/S, did not influence patients' recovery. In Group S, postoperative nausea and vomiting occurred frequently, and 50{\%} of patients complained of discomfort during induction. In Group P/S, the costs for anaesthetics and total costs were lower than those in Groups P and S. CONCLUSIONS: Propofol- and sevoflurane-based maintenance of anaesthesia were similar with regard to patient comfort and recovery in the elderly. Cost analysis revealed that it was less expensive to use propofol for induction and sevoflurane for maintenance than to use either propofol or sevoflurane as sole agents for anaesthesia.},

	abstract = {Background: Postoperative delirium is associated with adverse postoperative outcomes. However, whether intravenous and inhalation anesthetics are associated with different risks of postoperative delirium remains unknown. Objective: We set up to determine the incidence and duration of postoperative delirium in older patients who had surgery under the intravenous anesthetic propofol or the inhalational anesthetic sevoflurane. Methods: Participants were patients who had total hip/knee replacements and were randomized to propofol (N = 106) or sevoflurane (N = 103) anesthesia group. The Confusion Assessment Method was employed by investigators who were blinded to the anesthesia regimen to assess the incidence and duration (days of postoperative delirium per person) of postoperative delirium on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3. Results: A total of 209 participants (71.2$\pm$6.7 years old, 29.2{\%} male) were included in the final data analysis. The incidence of postoperative delirium was 33.0{\%} with propofol anesthesia and 23.3{\%} with sevoflurane anesthesia (p  = 0.119, Chi-square test ), and we estimated that we would need 316 participants in each arm to detect a potential statistically significant difference. Days of postoperative delirium per person were higher in the propofol (0.5$\pm$0.8) anesthesia group compared to the sevoflurane anesthesia group (0.3$\pm$0.5, p  = 0.049, Student 's t-test ). Conclusion: This pilot study established a system to compare effects of different anesthetics and generated a hypothesis that propofol trended to have a higher incidence and had longer duration of postoperative delirium than sevoflurane. Additional studies with a larger sample size are needed to test this hypothesis.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: We wished to compare the effectiveness of intravenous-based (IV) and epidural-based (EPI) techniques for anesthesia and postoperative analgesia in elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Effectiveness was compared in terms of reduction of postoperative pain and adverse events, and achieving a high level of patient satisfaction. METHODS: Thirty American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I-II patients aged more than 65 years, scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, were enrolled in this study. The patients in the IV group (n = 15) received modified neurolept anesthesia with droperidol 0.2 mgxkg(-1) and pentazocine 0.15-0.3 mgxkg(-1) (maximum dose of 1.0 mgxkg(-1)) and 60{\%} nitrous oxide in oxygen, followed by postoperative intravenous infusion of 20 microgxml(-1) buprenorphine, provided with a patient-controlled analgesia pump programmed to deliver a bolus of 0.5 ml with a lockout interval of 15 min and a background infusion of 0.5 mlxh(-1). The patients in the EPI group (n = 15) had combined epidural analgesia and general anesthesia with sevoflurane and 60{\%} nitrous oxide in oxygen, followed by the epidural infusion of a 0.125{\%} bupivacaine and 5 microg x ml(-1) buprenorphine mixture by means of an on-demand analgesic system (bolus of 2 ml, lockout interval of 60 min, and background infusion of 2 mlxh(-1)). RESULTS: The quality of postoperative analgesia was similar in the two groups. The incidences of intraoperative hypotension and bradycardia and postoperative hypotension were significantly lower in the IV group than in the EPI group (P < 0.05). A significantly higher level of patient satisfaction was found in the IV group compared with that in the EPI group (P < 0.05). The major contributor to dissatisfaction in the EPI group was anxiety or discomfort associated with the epidural procedures. CONCLUSION: Modified neurolept anesthesia with pentazocine and postoperative i.v. analgesia with buprenorphine were superior to epidural-based techniques, in terms of hemodynamic stability and patient satisfaction, in elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Post-operative mental dysfunction may be an important problem in elderly patients. This study was designed to compare the effects of propofol and sevoflurane anesthesia on recovery characteristics and the incidence of post-operative delirium (POD) in long-duration laparoscopic surgery for elderly patients. METHODS: Fifty ASA physical status I-II patients over the age of 65 scheduled for laparoscopic surgery lasting 3 h or more randomly received propofol (group P, n = 25) or sevoflurane (group S, n = 25) for both induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. Both groups were combined with continuous perioperative epidural analgesia. The level of primary anesthetics was adjusted to maintain changes in mean arterial pressure within 20{\%} of the pre-anesthetic values. The emergence times from anesthesia (eye opening, extubation, response to command, and orientation) were recorded, and the occurrence of POD was assessed by the delirium rating scale (DRS) during the first 3 days after surgery. All patients received oxygen and continuous epidural analgesia postoperatively. RESULTS: Immediate emergence, i.e. eye opening and extubation was significantly faster after sevoflurane (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the incidences of POD in the two groups during the first 3 days after surgery. The scores for DRS on day 2 and 3 after surgery, however, were significantly higher in group P than in group S (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Sevoflurane may be preferable to propofol for general anesthesia in combination with epidural analgesia with respect to less effect on mental function during the early postoperative period for long-duration laparoscopic surgery in elderly patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Propofol may help to protect against ischaemic acute kidney injury (AKI); however, research on this topic is sparse. OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to investigate whether there were differences in the incidence of postoperative AKI after lung resection surgery between patients who received propofol-based total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) and those who received sevoflurane-based inhalational anaesthesia. DESIGN: A retrospective observational study. SETTING: A single tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS: Medical records of patients aged 19 years or older who underwent curative lung resection surgery for nonsmall cell lung cancer between January 2005 and February 2018 were examined. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: After propensity score matching, the incidence of AKI in the first 3 postoperative days was compared between patients who received propofol and those who received sevoflurane. Logistic regression analyses were also used to investigate whether propofol-based TIVA lowered the risk of postoperative AKI. RESULTS: The analysis included 2872 patients (1477 in the sevoflurane group and 1395 in the propofol group). After propensity score matching, 661 patients were included in each group; 24 (3.6{\%}) of the 661 patients in the sevoflurane group developed AKI compared with 23 (3.5{\%}) of the 661 patients in the propofol group (95{\%} confidence intervals of difference in incidence -0.019 to 0.022, P = 0.882). The logistic regression analyses revealed that the incidence of AKI was not different in the two groups (odds ratio 0.96, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.53 to 1.71, P = 0.882). CONCLUSION: In this retrospective study, no significant difference was found in the incidence of postoperative AKI after lung resection surgery between patients who received propofol-based TIVA and those who received sevoflurane-based inhalational anaesthesia. Considering the methodological limitation of this retrospective study, further studies are required to confirm these results.},

	abstract = {Objective: In this article, we aimed to test the hypothesis that maintenance of hemodynamic stability with anesthesia and no-touch aortic technique in off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) may diminish postoperative mental complications in elderly patients. Material and Methods: Between June 2009 and December 2009, 88 elderly patients (53 males, 35 females; mean age 71$\pm$7 years; range 64 to 78 years) with a physical status of ASA II-III who underwent elective off-pump CABG surgery in our hospital's operating rooms and cardiovascular and thoracic intensive care units were included in this prospective randomized study with signed informed consents. Patients undergoing off-pump CABG surgery performed by a surgeon were randomly assigned into two groups, including total intravenous anesthesia (group TIVA, n=40; mean age 66$\pm$4) or inhalational anesthesia (group IA, n=40; mean age 69$\pm$3). The effect of off-pump CABG surgery on mental outcome was assessed with S100 protein, a neurochemical marker of brain injury under ischemic conditions. Comparison of mental function before and after off-pump CABG surgery, hemodynamic stability and time to discharge were the main outcomes of the study. Results: Hemodynamic values were stable in both groups. None of the patients showed marked increase in serum concentrations of S100 postoperatively (p<0.001). The mean total off-pump CABG time was 48$\pm$15 minutes in both groups. There was no difference between the groups in terms of time to discharge. Conclusion: We believe that well-performed hemodynamic stability with either intravenous or general anesthesia may offer a well-controlled mental function in elderly patients undergoing offpump CABG surgery.},

	abstract = {We evaluated whether volatile anesthetics can improve the postoperative outcomes of non-cardiac surgery in patients with preoperative myocardial injury defined by the cardiac troponin elevation. From January 2010 to June 2018, 1254 adult patients with preoperative myocardial injury underwent non-cardiac surgery under general anesthesia and were enrolled in this study. Patients were stratified into following two groups according to anesthetic agents; 115 (9.2{\%}) patients whose anesthesia was induced and maintained with continuous infusion of propofol and remifentanil (TIVA group) and 1139 (90.8{\%}) patients whose anesthesia was maintainted with volatile anesthetics (VOLATILE group). The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. To diminish the remifentanil effect, a further analysis was conducted after excluding the patients who received only volatile anesthetics without remifentanil infusion. In a propensity-score matched analysis, 30-day mortality was higher in the TIVA group than the VOLATILE group (17.0{\%} vs. 9.1{\%}; hazard ratio {$[$}HR{$]$} 2.60; 95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$}, 1.14-5.93; p = 0.02). In addition, the TIVA group showed higher 30-day mortality than the VOLATILE group, even after eliminating the effect of remifentanil infusion (15.8{\%} vs. 8.3{\%}; HR 4.62; 95{\%} CI, 1.82-11.74; p = 0.001). In our study, the use of volatile anesthetics showed the significant survival improvement after non-cardiac surgery in patients with preoperative myocardial injury, which appears to be irrelevant to the remifentanil use. Further studies are needed to confirm this beneficial effect of volatile anesthetics. Clinical trial number and registry URL: KCT0004349 (www.cris.nih.go.kr).},

@article{16931,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: The effects of general anesthetics on cognitive impairment are unclear and complicated. Laser laryngeal surgery (LLS) requires the administration of low levels of oxygen, which may increase the risk of desaturation and brain function impairment. This prospective randomized trial aimed to compare the effects of desflurane and propofol-based general anesthesia on the occurrence of early postoperative cognitive decline in elderly patients undergoing LLS. METHODS: Seventy-three patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists grade I or II and at least 65 years of age were randomly allocated to receive either desflurane-based (Group D) or propofol-based (Group P) anesthesia during LLS. The standard anesthesia protocol was performed, with a bispectral index between 40 and 60 and a mean arterial pressure within 20{\%} of baseline values. Intraoperative regional oxygen saturation values were recorded. Each patient was assessed using the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) test during the preoperative period (baseline), 30 min after extubation in the postanesthesia care unit, and 1, 3, and 24 h after surgery. RESULTS: MMSE scores improved slightly in both groups compared to baseline during the early postoperative period, but these increases were not statistically significant. No significant differences were identified in MMSE scores between groups. Only three patients (9.6{\%}) in group D and one patient (3.1{\%}) in group P developed cognitive impairment (p = 0.583). CONCLUSION: Low intraoperative inspired oxygen concentration during short-duration LLS did not reduce early postoperative cognitive function in elderly patients. Desflurane or propofol-based anesthesia had similar effects on early neurocognition after LLS. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2 Laryngoscope, 133:640-646, 2023.},

@article{4033,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Elderly patients are reportedly at higher risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) after inhalational anesthesia with sevoflurane. We hypothesized that the incidence of POCD would be higher in elderly patients undergoing major surgery under inhalational rather than intravenous anesthesia. We also measured plasma S-100βprotein concentration as a biomarker of central nervous system injury, and plasma interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-αconcentrations to judge the contribution of systemic inflammation to POCD. METHODS: Ninety patients aged 65-75 years scheduled for resection of an esophageal carcinoma were randomly assigned to one of three groups (n = 30) as follows: a group receiving sevoflurane anesthesia (Group S); a group receiving preoperative methylprednisolone before sevoflurane anesthesia (Group S + MP); and a control group maintained with intravenous propofol (Group C). The mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) were used to measure patients' cognitive function the day before surgery, and on the first, third and seventh postoperative days. The plasma concentrations of TNF-α, IL-6 and S-100βprotein were measured 10 min before anesthesia, and on the first, third and seventh postoperative days. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the demographic or clinical characteristics, or perioperative hemodynamic status, of the three groups. The MMSE and MoCA scores were significantly lower in Group S than in the propofol control (Group C) and Group S + MP on the first, third and seventh postoperative days (P <0.05). Throughout the first postoperative week the plasma concentrations of TNF-α, IL-6, and S-100βprotein were significantly elevated in Group S compared with Group C (P <0.05), but were significantly lower in Group S + MP than Group S (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of POCD was higher in elderly patients undergoing major surgery under inhalational anesthesia with sevoflurane than those maintained on intravenous propofol, and lower in elderly patients pro-treating with methylprednisolone. Furthermore, we found elevated plasma concentrations of S-100βprotein, TNF-αand IL-6 in those receiving sevoflurane anesthesia. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ChiCTR-IOR-15007007 (02-09-2015).},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of sustained inhalation of sevoflurane on cognitive function and the expression of oxidative stress response proteins such as NADPH oxidase subunits NOX2 and NOX4 in elderly patients undergoing radical surgery for lung cancer. STUDY DESIGN: An experimental study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Anesthesiology, Suzhou Kowloon Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, China, from February 2016 to October 2017. METHODOLOGY: Elderly patients who underwent radical surgery for lung cancer were divided into the sevoflurane group and the propofol group, with 52 cases in each group. Sustained inhalation of sevoflurane and propofol was administered to maintain anesthesia in the respective groups. Cognitive function and lung function parameters were compared between the two groups. Serum S100 {$\beta$} levels and expression of NOX2 and NOX4 proteins in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the two groups were determined. RESULTS: At 24 hours after surgery, the lung function indices of the sevoflurane group such as FEV1, FVC and VC were higher than those of the propofol group (p<0.001, p=0.008 and p=0.002, respectively). At the end of the surgery and at 24 hours after surgery, the MMSE scores of the sevoflurane group were higher than the propofol group (all p<0.001). S100levels were lower than the propofol group (p=0.003 and p<0.001, respectively). Levels of NADPH oxidase subunits NOX2 and NOX4 proteins in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the sevoflurane group were lower than the propofol group (p=0.033, p<0.001, p<0.001and p<0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Compared with intravenous anesthesia with propofol, general anesthesia with sevoflurane inhalation has little effect on the short-term cognitive function in elderly patients undergoing radical surgery for lung cancer, and can effectively improve lung function. The mechanism may be related to the reduction of the expression of NOX2 and NOX4 proteins.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is evident in 26{\%} of elderly patients seven days after major non-cardiac surgery. Despite the growing popularity of day surgery, the influence of anesthetic techniques on next day POCD has not been investigated. Therefore, we evaluated the incidence of POCD and changes in serum markers of neuronal damage (S-100ss protein and Neuron-Specific Enolase), 24 hr after single-agent propofol or sevoflurane anesthesia in elderly patients undergoing minor surgery. METHODS: Patients (n = 30, mean age 73, range 65-86 yr) coming for cystoscopy or hysteroscopy, were randomized, in an observer-blind design, to receive either single-agent propofol or sevoflurane anesthesia. Changes in neuropsychological tests (the Stroop test and the modified Word-Recall Test), 24 hr postoperatively were compared with age-matched control subjects (n = 15) using Z-score analysis. Changes in S-100beta protein and Neuron-Specific Enolase levels were also documented. RESULTS: POCD was present in 7/15 {$[$}47{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 21 to 72{\%}){$]$} patients who received propofol and 7/15 {$[$}47{\%} (95{\%} CI 21 to 72{\%}){$]$} patients who received sevoflurane, compared with 1/15 {$[$}7{\%} (95{\%} CI 6 to 19{\%}){$]$} control patients, P = 0.03. S-100beta protein and Neuron-Specific Enolase levels were not significantly different in anesthetized patients postoperatively compared with preoperative values. CONCLUSION: The incidence of POCD in elderly patients on the first day after minor surgery is higher than previously reported for seven days after major surgery, and is increased after both propofol and sevoflurane anesthesia, compared with age-matched controls. S-100beta protein and Neuron-Specific Enolase levels were unaffected by anesthetic technique.},

@article{14821,
	abstract = {Perioperative increase in oxidative activity in surgical patients reportedly prevents postoperative surgical site infection (SSI). Several clinical studies have shown that oxidative activity under sevoflurane anaesthesia was higher than that under propofol anaesthesia. Therefore, we hypothesised that sevoflurane anaesthesia would discourage SSI compared with propofol anaesthesia. To examine the effect of anaesthesia maintained with sevoflurane and propofol on SSI, a total of 265 consecutive adult patients, with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 1-3, who underwent elective open gastrointestinal surgery under general anaesthesia, were surveyed for SSI between January 2007 and December 2008. Sevoflurane or propofol was selected to maintain anaesthesia in 95 and 170 patients, respectively. A propensity score was used for pairwise matching of these patients to avoid selection biases between the two methods of anaesthesia. Propensity matching yielded 84 pairs of patients. We compared standardised infection ratios (SIRs), i.e. the quotient of the number of SSI cases observed and the number of SSI cases expected, calculated using data from the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance, between sevoflurane and propofol anaesthesia. After propensity matching, SIR after sevoflurane anaesthesia was 1.89 {$[$}95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.46-2.32{$]$}, which was significantly lower than after propofol anaesthesia (4.78; 95{\%} CI: 4.30-5.27) (P=0.02). This study suggests that sevoflurane tends to suppress SSI after elective open gastrointestinal surgery compared with propofol.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to investigate the incidence of delirium, wake-up times and early post-operative cognitive decline in one hundred obese elderly patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. DESIGN: Prospective randomized trial. SETTINGS: Operating room, postoperative recovery area, hospital wards. PATIENTS: 100 obese patients (ASA II and III) undergoing primary total knee replacement under general anesthesia with a femoral nerve block catheter. INTERVENTION: Patients were prospectively randomized to maintenance anesthesia with either propofol or desflurane. MEASUREMENTS: The primary endpoint assessed by a blinded investigator was delirium as measured by the Confusion Assessment Method. Secondary endpoints were wake-up times and a battery of six different tests of cognitive function. MAIN RESULTS: Four of the 100 patients that gave informed consent withdrew from the study. Of the remaining 96 patients, 6 patients did not complete full CAM testing. Preoperative pain scores, durations of surgery and anesthesia, and amount of intraoperative fentanyl were not different between groups. One patient in the propofol group developed delirium compared to zero in desflurane. One patient in desflurane group developed a confused state not characterized as delirium. Fifty percent of the patients exhibited a 20{\%} decrease in the results of at least one cognitive test on the first 2days after surgery, with no difference between groups. There were no differences in the time to emergence from anesthesia, incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, and length of postanesthesia care unit (PACU) stay between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion we found a low incidence of delirium but significant cognitive decline in the first 48h after surgery. In this relatively small sample size of a hundred patients there was no difference in the incidence of postoperative delirium, early cognitive outcomes, or wake up times between the desflurane or propofol group.},

	abstract = {AIMS: To determine the effect of choice of inhalational anaesthetic (sevoflurane vs propofol) on the incidence and severity of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in elderly patients (aged >/= 60 years) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: Elderly patients with MCI undergoing radical rectal resection were randomly assigned to receive sevoflurane or propofol general anaesthesia. Cognitive function was assessed using neuropsychological testing before and 7 days after surgery. POCD severity was graded as mild, moderate or severe using standard deviation cut-offs. RESULTS: At 7 days after surgery, the incidence of POCD was 29.7{\%} in the propofol group (n = 101) and 33.3{\%} in the sevoflurane group (n = 99). There was a signi fi cant between-group difference for POCD severity: sevoflurane anaesthesia had a more severe impact on cognitive function than propofol anaesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in the incidence of POCD at 7 days after radical rectal resection under sevoflurane or propofol-based general anaesthesia. Both propofol and sevoflurane were associated with negative cognitive effects, but sevoflurane had a more severe impact on cognitive function than propofol, in elderly patients with MCI.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of propofol and sevoflurane anesthesia on the inflammatory response, pulmonary function and cognitive function of patients undergoing lung cancer resection and their differences. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 62 patients with lung cancer who underwent pulmonary lobectomy from January 2014 to January 2016 in Jining First People's Hospital were selected and randomly divided into two groups: the propofol group (n=31) and the sevoflurane group (n=31). Patients in the propofol group were treated with intravenous injection of propofol for anesthesia maintenance, whereas those in the sevoflurane group inhaled sevoflurane for anesthesia maintenance. All patients underwent surgical resection of the lobes by the same operator. Changes in the inflammatory response and pulmonary function of patients in the perioperative period were recorded before the induced anesthesia (t1), before one-lung ventilation (t2), after sternal closure by operation (t3) and at 24 h after operation (t4), respectively; the extubation time, eye opening time and response time of two groups of patients were recorded; mini-mental state examination (MMSE) was used to evaluate the changes in cognitive function in patients and detect the concentration of S100 calcium-binding protein β(S100β) in serum of patients before the induced anesthesia and at 24 h after operation, respectively. RESULTS: The difference of partial pressure of alveolar-arterial oxygen (A-aDO2), respiratory index (RI) and intra-pulmonary shunt fraction (Qs/ Qt) of two groups of patients at t2 and t3 were significantly higher than those at t1 (p<0.01); during t2-t3, A-aDO2, RI and Qs/Qt of patients in the propofol group were significantly lower than those of patients in the sevoflurane group (p<0.05); the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in serum of patients after the induced anesthesia in the propofol group were significantly higher than those at t1, while the level of interleukin-10 (IL-10) was lower than that at t1 (p<0.01); during t2-t4, the levels of IL-6 and MMP-9 in serum of patients in the propofol group were significantly lower than those in patients in the sevoflurane group, while the level of IL-10 was significantly higher than that in patients in the sevoflurane group (p<0.05). The postoperative extubation time, eye opening time and response time of patients in the propofol group were significantly shorter than those of patients in the sevoflurane group (p<0.05). From intraoperative period to 24 h after operation, the prevalence rate of adverse reactions in patients in the propofol group was significantly lower than that in patients in the sevoflurane group (p<0.05); MMSE scores of two groups of patients at t4 were significantly lower than those at t1, while the concentration of S100βwas significantly higher than that at t1 (p<0.01); at t4, the MMSE score of patients in the propofol group was significantly higher than that in the sevoflurane group, while the concentration of S100βwas lower than that of patients in the sevoflurane group (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with sevoflurane anesthesia, propofol anesthesia can significantly reduce the perioperative inflammatory response in patients receiving lung cancer resection, shorten the recovery time after operation, protect the pulmonary function of patients, improve postoperative cognitive function, and reduce the prevalence rate of intraoperative adverse reactions.},

	abstract = {Background: Animal studies have shown that isoflurane and propofol have differential effects on Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and memory, although it is unclear whether this occurs in humans. Methods: This was a nested randomised controlled trial within a prospective cohort study; patients age ≥60 yr undergoing noncardiac/non-neurological surgery were randomised to isoflurane or propofol for anaesthetic maintenance. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected via lumbar puncture before, 24 h, and 6 weeks after surgery. Cognitive testing was performed before and 6 weeks after surgery. Nonparametric methods and linear regression were used to evaluate CSF biomarkers and cognitive function, respectively. Results: There were 107 subjects (54 randomised to isoflurane and 53 to propofol) who completed the 6-week follow-up and were included in the analysis. There was no significant effect of anaesthetic treatment group, time, or group-by-time interaction for CSF amyloid-beta (Aβ), tau, or phospho-tau181p levels, or on the tau/Aβor p-tau181p/Aβratios (all P>0.05 after Bonferroni correction). In multivariable-adjusted intention-to-treat analyses, there were no significant differences between the isoflurane and propofol groups in 6-week postoperative change in overall cognition (mean difference {$[$}95{\%} confidence interval{$]$}: 0.01 {$[$}--0.12 to 0.13{$]$}; P=0.89) or individual cognitive domains (P>0.05 for each). Results remained consistent across as-treated and per-protocol analyses. Conclusions: Intraoperative anaesthetic maintenance with isoflurane vs propofol had no significant effect on postoperative cognition or CSF Alzheimer's disease-related biomarkers within 6 weeks after noncardiac, non-neurological surgery in older adults.

	abstract = {Objectives: To analyze the effects of intravenous anesthesia with sevoflurane combined with propofol on intraoperative hemodynamics, postoperative stress disorder and cognitive function in elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. Methods: Eighty elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery in Xianning Central Hospital from September 2014 to February 2018. Enrolled patients were divided into observation group (n=40) and control group (n=40) according to the random regionalization method. Patients in the control group were given intravenous anesthesia with propofol, while those in the observation group were provided with a combined use of sevoflurane based on the method in the control group. The general surgical data, intraoperative hemodynamics, postoperative stress disorder and cognitive function were compared between the two groups. Results: There were no blood transfusions and no complications during operation in the two groups, and the operation completed successfully. There was no significant difference in the time of unconsciousness, intubation time, and duration of pneumoperitoneum establishment (p>0.05). However, the spontaneous breathing time, eye opening time upon calling and extubation time in observation group were shorter than those in control group (p 0.05). The heart rate (HR) in the two groups at intubation and at exploration was significantly higher than that at the time of entering the room (p 0.05), which was lower in observation group than that in control group (p 0.05). While there was no significant difference in the index at the other time points compared with that before entering the room and control group (p>0.05). The systolic blood pressure (SBP) had different degrees of change before intubation, after 0 minutes, three minutes and six minutes of intubation, after 0 minutes and five minutes of pneumoperitoneum establishment and at exploration when compared with that before entering the room (p 0.05). But the SBP at intubation and at exploration was significantly lower in observation group than that in control group (p 0.05). MAP was only decreased significantly at intubation compared with that before entering the room (p 0.05). At exploration, there was no significant fluctuation in the MAP level in observation group (p 0.05), but the MAP was increased significantly in control group (p 0.05). In addition, the postoperative stress disorder in observation group was milder than that in control group (p 0.05), and the postoperative cognitive function was better than that in control group (p 0.05). Conclusions: Intravenous anesthesia with sevoflurane combined with propofol has little effects on intraoperative hemodynamics and postoperative cognitive function in elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. Besides, it can obtain better recovery quality and have milder postoperative stress disorder than single use of propofol.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Postoperative delirium incidences are increasing in older adults. A Cochrane Review found no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative delirium between total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and inhalational anesthesia (IA). This study evaluated the differences in postoperative delirium and morbidity between patients who underwent either TIVA or IA. METHODS: A nationwide Japanese inpatient database was used to retrospectively compare differences in postoperative delirium and composite morbidity between patients older than 65 years, who underwent general anesthesia (TIVA or IA). The primary outcome was postoperative delirium. The secondary outcomes were: morbidity incidence, length of hospital stay, and mortality. A 1:3 propensity score analysis of patients who underwent all surgical procedures was conducted according to covariates, to calculate odds ratios and their 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs). Sensitivity analyses were conducted using an instrumental variable analysis of the proportion of TIVA by hospital scale, stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting analyses, limiting the definitions of postoperative delirium, and subgroup analysis. RESULTS: Of 738,600 patients, 149,540 received TIVA and 589,060 received IA. After 1:3 propensity score matching, the adjusted odds ratios for postoperative delirium and composite morbidity were 0.93 (95{\%} CI 0.91-0.95) and 0.94 (95{\%} CI 0.90-0.97), respectively, for TIVA concerning IA. There were no differences in the length of the intensive care unit and hospital stay, or hospital mortality. The findings were consistent with the sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that TIVA was related to a slightly decreased postoperative delirium and incidence of morbidity compared to IA.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Volatile anesthetics reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and mortality in coronary artery surgery. Recently, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines suggested the use of volatile anesthetic agents for the maintenance of general anesthesia during noncardiac surgery in patients at risk for perioperative myocardial ischemia, but no randomized experience to document the cardioprotective effects of these agents exists in this setting. Therefore, the authors performed a prospective, randomized, controlled trial to compare the effects of sevoflurane versus total intravenous anesthesia, in terms of postoperative cardiac troponin I release in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. DESIGN: A randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: A teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-eight consecutive patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were allocated randomly to receive either volatile anesthetic (44 patients) as the main anesthetic agent or total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) (44 patients). MEASUREMENTS: Postoperative cardiac troponin I release was measured as a marker of myocardial necrosis. Patients with detectable postoperative troponin I in the sevoflurane group (12/44, 27.3{\%}) were similar to those in the propofol group (9/44, 20.5{\%}; p = 0.6). There was no significant reduction of postoperative median peak cTnI release (0.16 $\pm$0.71 ng/mL in the sevoflurane group compared with the TIVA group, 0.03 $\pm$0.08 ng/mL; p = 0.4). Three patients died at the 1-year follow-up for noncardiac causes (2 in the TIVA group). CONCLUSIONS: In the authors' experience, patients undergoing noncardiac surgery did not benefit from anesthesia based on halogenated anesthetics. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the cardioprotective effects of volatile agents in noncardiac surgery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The choice of general anaesthetics may affect postoperative cognitive outcomes. This study was designed to compare the potential impact of propofol-based vs sevoflurane-based general anaesthesia on the development of delayed neurocognitive recovery in older adults early after major cancer surgery. METHODS: Older adults (aged ≥65 and <90 yr) who were scheduled to undergo major cancer surgery (≥2 h) were randomised to receive either propofol- or sevoflurane-based general anaesthesia. Cognitive function was assessed before and 1 week after surgery with a battery of neuropsychological tests. Age- and education-matched non-surgical controls were recruited, and their cognitive functions were tested at comparable time intervals in order to adjust for learning effects from repeated tests. Delayed neurocognitive recovery was diagnosed according to the International Study of Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction 1 definition. RESULTS: From April 1, 2015 to October 15, 2016, 392 patients were enrolled and randomised. Of these patients, 387 completed the intervention and 30-day follow-up, and 379 completed 1-week neuropsychological tests. Fifty-nine control subjects were enrolled and completed repeated neuropsychological tests. The incidence of delayed neurocognitive recovery at 1 week was significantly lower in the propofol group {$[$}14.8{\%} (28/189){$]$} than in the sevoflurane group {$[$}23.2{\%} (44/190); odds ratio=0.577; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.342-0.975; P=0.038{$]$}. Safety outcomes did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: When compared with sevoflurane-based general anaesthesia, propofol-based general anaesthesia might decrease the incidence of delayed neurocognitive recovery in older adults after major cancer surgery.

	abstract = {Purpose: To investigate the effects of propofol and sevoflurane on intraoperative and postoperative outcomes of lung cancer patients after thoracoscopic surgery. Methods: Lung cancer patients (n = 265) aged 51 - 73 years (mean age = 62 $\pm$11 years) who underwent thoracoscopic surgery under propofol or sevoflurane anesthesia were recruited over a 2-year period for this study. Data on perioperative pulmonary function, inflammatory responses, awakening time, postoperative pain and adverse reactions, pre- and postoperative cognitive functions, as well as duration of hospital stay were retrospectively analyzed. Results: Perioperative pulmonary function was poor in patients who were operated under sevoflurane, relative to those who were operated under propofol (p < 0.05). After sternal closure (just before one-lung ventilation), levels of serum of interleukin 6 (IL-6), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), and S100βprotein were reported to be higher in patients of sevoflurane group than those in propofol group, but interleukin 10 (IL-10) level was markedly reduced in sevoflurane group, relative to propofol group (p < 0.05). Awakening times and visual analog scale score of patients 24 h after thoracoscopic surgery of patients in sevoflurane group were significantly higher than those in propofol group (p < 0.05). Conclusion: These results indicate that propofol is more effective than sevoflurane in the protection of pulmonary and cognitive functions of patients after thoracoscopic surgery. Thus, intravenous propofol anesthesia is recommended for thoracoscopic surgery for lung cancer.},
