	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inguinal hernia repair is a common surgical procedure, and different types of anesthetic techniques are in use. We wanted to test if preoperative inguinal field block (IFB) with ropivacaine would provide benefits in the postoperative period compared with general anesthesia and wound infiltration. METHODS: Sixty patients scheduled for inguinal hernia repair were randomized to receive general anesthesia with wound infiltration postoperatively, or inguinal field block (IFB) before surgery, with no or only light sedation intraoperatively. General anesthesia was induced with midazolam, fentanyl and propofol, maintained with propofol and alfentanil, and supplemented with nitrous oxide in oxygen through a laryngeal mask. The IFB was performed by an anesthesiologist, with 50-60 ml ropivacaine and 5 mg/ml with a dedicated technique. RESULTS: All significant differences were in favor of the IFB group: less pain (visual analog scale, verbal pain score) postoperatively and until day 7, faster mobilization with less pain, lower analgesic consumption, and higher patient satisfaction. CONCLUSION: Preoperative inguinal field block for hernia repair provides benefits for patients in terms of faster recovery, less pain, better mobilization and higher satisfaction throughout the whole first postoperative week.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE Geriatric patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery have unique needs due to the physiological changes of aging. They are at risk for adverse outcomes such as delirium, infection, and iatrogenic complications, and these complications, in turn, contribute to the risk of functional decline, nursing home admission, and death. Whether preoperative and perioperative comanagement by a geriatrician reduces the incidence of in-hospital complications and length of in-hospital stay after elective lumbar spine surgery remains unknown. METHODS A unique model of comanagement for elderly patients undergoing lumbar fusion surgery was implemented at a major academic medical center. The Perioperative Optimization of Senior Health (POSH) program was launched with the aim of improving outcomes in elderly patients (> 65 years old) undergoing complex lumbar spine surgery. In this model, a geriatrician evaluates elderly patients preoperatively, in addition to performing routine preoperative anesthesia surgical screening, and comanages them daily throughout the course of their hospital stay to manage medical comorbid conditions and coordinate multidisciplinary rehabilitation along with the neurosurgical team. The first 100 cases were retrospectively reviewed after initiation of the POSH protocol and compared with the immediately preceding 25 cases to assess the incidence of perioperative complications and clinical outcomes. RESULTS One hundred twenty-five patients undergoing lumbar decompression and fusion were enrolled in this pilot program. Baseline characteristics were similar between both cohorts. The mean length of in-hospital stay was 30{\%} shorter in the POSH cohort (6.13 vs 8.72 days; p = 0.06). The mean duration of time between surgery and patient mobilization was significantly shorter in the POSH cohort compared with the non-POSH cohort (1.57 days vs 2.77 days; p = 0.02), and the number of steps ambulated on day of discharge was 2-fold higher in the POSH cohort (p = 0.04). Compared with the non-POSH cohort, the majority of patients in the POSH cohort were discharged to home (24{\%} vs 54{\%}; p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Geriatric comanagement reduces the incidence of postoperative complications, shortens the duration of in-hospital stay, and contributes to improved perioperative functional status in elderly patients undergoing elective spinal surgery for the correction of adult degenerative scoliosis.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Postoperative delirium (POD) is known to be one of the most critical complications of major operative procedures in elderly patients. Since disorders of the sleep-wake cycle have been reported to be one of the key factors in POD, we attempted to clarify the effectiveness of improving sleep-wake cycle disorders with medication after surgery to prevent POD, by conducting a prospective randomized study of 42 elderly patients who underwent resection of either gastric or colon cancer through an open laparotomy. METHODS: The delirium-free protocol (DFP) group was given an intramuscular injection of diazepam at 20:00 h each night, as well as a continuous intravenous infusion of flunitrazepam and pethidine administered over 8 h, for the first three nights postoperatively. Two patients were excluded because of failure to complete the DFP. RESULTS: The incidence of POD was 7/20 (35.0{\%}) in the non-DFP group and 1/20 (5.0{\%}) in the DFP group, this difference being significant (P = 0.023). Morning lethargy produced by the DFP was observed in 40{\%} of the DFP group; however, no other side effects were seen. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that DFP treatment is effective for controlling POD in elderly patients after general surgery and does not appear to be associated with severe complications or side effects. To our knowledge, this is the first report proposing artificial control of the sleep-awake rhythm by medication as a means of preventing POD in elderly patients.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In this study, postoperative pain and anxiety level of the patients who were scheduled for spinal anesthesia (SA) and remained awake during the operation and patients who were scheduled for general anesthesia (GA) and were asleep during the operation were assessed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-six patients who underwent total knee arthroplasty in our clinic were randomly divided into two groups. The first group (SA group) was given spinal anesthesia during operation (heavy marcaine), while the second group (GA group) underwent general anesthesia (propofol + nitric oxide). Hospital anxiety-depression (HAD) scores and visual analog scale (VAS) scores of the patients were calculated postoperatively. The patients were asked to score anxiety by the physicians. RESULTS: The mean postoperative HAD score was 24.68 in GA group, and 29.62 in SA group (p>0.05). The physicians score for patients' anxiety after surgery was 1.05 in GA group, and 1.69 in SA group (p<0.05). The mean postoperative VAS of the patients was 8.42 in GA group, and 8.87 in SA group (p>0.05). No statistically significant differences were found between the SA group and GA group in terms of HAD scores. No significant differences were found between the mean postoperative VAS scores of the groups. A statistically significant difference was found between the two groups for the physician's score for patients' postoperative anxiety. CONCLUSION: Our study results showed that total knee arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia was not associated with mood changes in patients and no increase in postoperative pain was seen.},

@article{Alas2020,
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Spinal anesthesia can be a potential risk factor for postoperative urinary retention (POUR). Our objective was to compare POUR rates for outpatient vaginal pelvic floor surgeries when using spinal versus general anesthesia. Our hypothesis was that spinal anesthesia would have higher POUR rates compared with general anesthesia. METHODS: This was a randomized clinical trial on subjects undergoing outpatient pelvic organ prolapse (POP) surgery with a concomitant midurethral sling (MUS). Subjects were discharged home the same day as surgery. Subjects were excluded if they had a preoperative post-void residual > 150 ml, they were < 40 years of age, surgery was < 1 h, or they had contraindications to spinal or general anesthesia. A standardized voiding trial was performed. The primary aim was to compare POUR rates between anesthesia groups. A power analysis estimated 28 subjects were required per group to detect a 37{\%} difference with 80{\%} power and an alpha of 0.05. RESULTS: The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov on July 15, 2015. Sixty-one subjects were enrolled between June 22, 2015, and December 31, 2017. Three were excluded, leaving 29 in each group. Groups were similar in demographics. For the primary outcome, there was a 14.3{\%} difference in POUR rates between spinal and general anesthesia, which did not reach statistical significance based on our power calculation (p = 0.2516). CONCLUSIONS: Based on this study, there is not an increased rate of POUR with the use of spinal anesthesia for POP surgery with MUS. However, since there was a trend toward higher rates of POUR in the spinal group, it is possible that a larger powered study design would be able to detect a statistically significant difference between the groups. Based on these findings, if surgical patients would benefit from spinal anesthesia, the risk of urinary retention should not be considered a reason to not utilize this form of anesthesia. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Does spinal anesthesia for prolapse surgery with concomitant sling lead to an increase in urinary retention compared to general anesthesia? https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02547155?term=laura+martin\&rank=3 (NCT02547155).},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Postoperative delirium is one of the most common complications after cardiovascular surgery in older adults. Benzodiazepines are a reported risk factor for delirium; however, there are no studies investigating remimazolam, a novel anesthetic agent. Therefore, we prospectively investigated the effect of remimazolam on postoperative delirium. METHODS: We included elective cardiovascular surgery patients aged ≥65 years at Hamamatsu University Hospital between August 2020 and February 2022. Patients who received general anesthesia with remimazolam were compared with those who received other anesthetics (control group). The primary outcome was delirium within 5 days after surgery. Secondary outcomes were delirium during intensive care unit stay and hospitalization, total duration of delirium, subsyndromal delirium, and differences in the Mini-Mental State Examination scores from preoperative to postoperative days 2 and 5. To adjust for differences in the groups' baseline covariates, we used stabilized inverse probability weighting as the primary analysis and propensity score matching as the sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: We enrolled 200 patients; 78 in the remimazolam group and 122 in the control group. After stabilized inverse probability weighting, 30.3{\%} of the remimazolam group patients and 26.6{\%} of the control group patients developed delirium within 5 days (risk difference, 3.8{\%}; 95{\%} confidence interval -11.5{\%} to 19.1{\%}; p = 0.63). The secondary outcomes did not differ significantly between the groups, and the sensitivity analysis results were similar to those for the primary analysis. CONCLUSION: Remimazolam was not significantly associated with postoperative delirium when compared with other anesthetic agents.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIM: This is a feasibility study evaluating whether segmental epidural anesthesia is an alternative anesthetic approach to general anesthesia for percutaneous kyphoplasty. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After ethics committee approval was obtained, 52 ASA class I-III patients scheduled for elective, single-level percutaneous kyphoplasty were recruited. The patients were divided into two equal groups. In Group E (Group Epidural) segmental epidural anesthesia was performed using the loss of resistance technique with saline. In Group G (Group Control) general anesthesia was performed. Hemodynamic parameters, intraoperative and postoperative analgesic requirements, visual analogue scale (VAS) scores, length of stay in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), and complications were recorded. RESULTS: Hemodynamics were similar between the two groups. Postoperative analgesic requirement was significantly higher in Group G than in Group E (P < 0.004). VAS scores were significantly lower in Group E than in Group G (P < 0.05). Time to first pain experience at the first postoperative 4 h was significantly longer and length of stay in the PACU was significantly shorter in Group E than in Group G (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Segmental epidural anesthesia is a safe anesthetic technique for percutaneous kyphoplasty. This technique offered advantages over general anesthesia in terms of postoperative analgesia, analgesic consumption, early recovery, and short PACU stay. Therefore, it should be considered a suitable anesthetic technique in patients undergoing single level percutaneous kyphoplasty.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common and serious postoperative complication. Subanaesthetic ketamine is often administered intraoperatively for postoperative analgesia, and some evidence suggests that ketamine prevents delirium. The primary purpose of this trial was to assess the effectiveness of ketamine for prevention of postoperative delirium in older adults. METHODS: The Prevention of Delirium and Complications Associated with Surgical Treatments {$[$}PODCAST{$]$} study is a multicentre, international randomised trial that enrolled adults older than 60 years undergoing major cardiac and non-cardiac surgery under general anaesthesia. Using a computer-generated randomisation sequence we randomly assigned patients to one of three groups in blocks of 15 to receive placebo (normal saline), low-dose ketamine (0·5 mg/kg), or high dose ketamine (1·0 mg/kg) after induction of anaesthesia, before surgical incision. Participants, clinicians, and investigators were blinded to group assignment. Delirium was assessed twice daily in the first 3 postoperative days using the Confusion Assessment Method. We did analyses by intention-to-treat and assessed adverse events. This trial is registered with clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT01690988. FINDINGS: Between Feb 6, 2014, and June 26, 2016, 1360 patients were assessed, and 672 were randomly assigned, with 222 in the placebo group, 227 in the 0·5 mg/kg ketamine group, and 223 in the 1·0 mg/kg ketamine group. There was no difference in delirium incidence between patients in the combined ketamine groups and the placebo group (19·45{\%} vs 19·82{\%}, respectively; absolute difference 0·36{\%}, 95{\%} CI -6·07 to 7·38, p=0·92). There were more postoperative hallucinations (p=0·01) and nightmares (p=0·03) with increasing ketamine doses compared with placebo. Adverse events (cardiovascular, renal, infectious, gastrointestinal, and bleeding), whether viewed individually (p value for each >0·40) or collectively (36·9{\%} in placebo, 39·6{\%} in 0·5 mg/kg ketamine, and 40·8{\%} in 1·0 mg/kg ketamine groups, p=0·69), did not differ significantly across groups. INTERPRETATION: A single subanaesthetic dose of ketamine did not decrease delirium in older adults after major surgery, and might cause harm by inducing negative experiences.

	abstract = {Background: The aim of this clinical study was to evaluate the efficacy of neurobehavioral, hemodynamics and sedative characteristics of dexmedetomidine compared with morphine and midazolam-based regimen after cardiac surgery at equivalent levels of sedation and analgesia in improving clinically relevant outcomes such as delirium. Methods: Sixty patients were randomly allocated into one of two equal groups: group A = 30 patients received dexmedetomidine infusion (0.4-0.7 μg/kg/h) and Group B = 30 patients received morphine in a dose of 10-50 μg/kg/h as an analgesic with midazolam in a dose of 0.05 mg/kg up to 0.2 mg/kg as a sedative repeated as needed. Titration of the study medication infusions was conducted to maintain light sedation (Richmond agitation-sedation scale) (-2 to +1). Primary outcome was the prevalence of delirium measured daily through confusion assessment method for intensive care. Results: Group A was associated with shorter length of mechanical ventilation, significant shorter duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay (P = 0.038), and lower risk of delirium following cardiac surgery compared to Group B. Group A showed statistically significant decrease in heart rate values 4 h after ICU admission (P = 0.015) without significant bradycardia. Group A had lower fentanyl consumption following cardiac surgery compared to Group B. Conclusion: Dexmedetomidine significantly reduced the length of stay in ICU in adult cardiac surgery with no significant reduction in the incidence of postoperative delirium compared to morphine and midazolam.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate implementation of an innovative intervention designed to prevent complications and stimulate early rehabilitation among frail elderly inpatients. METHODS: The program was implemented in April 2011. A mixed-methods process evaluation and before-after study were performed. Primary effect outcomes included incidence of hospital-acquired delirium, cognitive decline, and decline in activities of daily living (ADL) during hospital stay. Secondary endpoints included ADL performance 3 months postdischarge, readmission, and caregiver burden. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-one preintervention and 195 postintervention patients aged 70 years or older were included. Overall, no significant differences in primary endpoints were found. Mean ADL between discharge and follow-up improved (3.2 vs 5.7, P = .058). Caregivers rated burden of care lower at 3 months postdischarge (.5 vs -.6, P = .049). CONCLUSIONS: The CareWell in Hospital program was implemented satisfactorily. Although the low baseline delirium incidence (11{\%}), higher comorbidity, and an increasing learning curve during a restricted implementation period potentially influenced the overall effects, this integrated care program may have beneficial effects on outcomes among frail elderly surgical patients.},

	abstract = {Ulinastatin combined with dexmedetomidine can improve postoperative cognitive function and central nerve specific protein (S-100β) level in elderly colorectal cancer (CC) patients after laparoscopic. Altogether 178 elderly patients who underwent laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery in our hospital from February 2018 to August 2019 were selected and divided into two groups according to the treatment methods. Those anesthetized by dexmedetomidine were regarded as the routine group (RG, 83 cases), and those anesthetized by ulinastatin and dexmedetomidine were considered as the combined group (CG, 95 cases). The operation conditions of the two groups, the pain scores (VAS) at 4 h, 24 h and 48 h after surgery, and the MMSE scores before, 1 d and 3 d after surgery were recorded. The incidence of cognitive dysfunction and adverse reactions were compared between both groups. The serum S-100βprotein (S-100β) and inflammatory factors were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The risk factors of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) were analyzed. The eye-opening time of clinical indexes in the CG was dramatically lower than in the RG, while other indexes had no marked difference. The VAS scores of the CG were lower than those of the RG at 4 h, 24 h and 48 h after operation. The MMSE scores of patients in the CG were dramatically higher than those in the RG at 1 d and 3 d after surgery. The total incidence of POCD in the CG was lower than that in the RG. There was no remarkable difference in the total incidence of adverse reactions between both groups. The S-100βexpression level in the CG was dramatically lower than in the RG at 1 d and 3 d after surgery. The improvement level of inflammatory factors in the CG was dramatically better than that in the RG. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis identified that the eye-opening time, VAS score, IL-10, TNFα, CRP, and S-100βwere independent risk factors for POCD occurrence in elderly CC patients after surgery. Ulinastatin combined with dexmedetomidine anesthesia induction can improve the prognosis of elderly CC patients after laparoscopic and it also reduces postoperative pain and serum inflammatory factors. S-100βconcentration can improve the POCD occurrence after surgery.},

@article{Barreto-Chang2022,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ketamine is typically used by anesthesiologists as an adjunct for general anesthesia and as a nonopioid analgesic. It has been explored for prevention of postoperative delirium, although results have been contradictory. In this study, we investigated the association of ketamine with postoperative delirium and specific encephalographic signatures. Furthermore, we examined these associations in the context of baseline neurocognition as measured by a validated assessment. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study from January 2019 to December 2020. Ninety-eight patients aged >/=65 years and undergoing spine surgery scheduled for >/=3 hours were included in the study. All participants who completed the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Brain Health Assessment preoperatively and postoperatively were assessed with the confusion assessment method for intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) and/or the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (NuDESC). Patients had frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings (SedLine Root, Masimo, Corp) quantitatively analyzed. We used 60 seconds of artifact-free EEG (without burst suppression) extracted from the middle of the maintenance period to calculate the normalized power spectral density (PSD). Comparisons were made between those who did or did not receive ketamine and according to results from neurocognitive assessments. RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients (of a total of 155, enrolled and consented) had EEG of sufficient quality for analysis (42 women). Overall, we found a significant increase in the EEG power in the moderate frequency range (10-20 Hz) in patients that received ketamine. When the patients were divided by their preoperative cognitive status, this result in the ketamine group only held true for the cognitively normal patients. Patients that were cognitively impaired at baseline did not demonstrate a significant change in EEG characteristics based on ketamine administration, but impaired patients that received ketamine had a significantly higher rate of postoperative delirium (52{\%} ketamine versus 20{\%} no ketamine) (odds ratio {$[$}OR{$]$}, 4.36; confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$}, 1.02-18.22; P = .048). In patients determined to be preoperatively cognitively normal, the incidence of postoperative delirium was not significantly associated with ketamine administration (19{\%} ketamine versus 17{\%} no ketamine) (OR, 1.10; CI, 0.30-4.04; P = .5833). CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine-related changes in EEG are observed in a heterogeneous group of patients receiving spine surgery. This result was driven primarily by the effect of ketamine on cognitively normal patients and not observed in patients that were cognitively impaired at baseline. Furthermore, patients who were cognitively impaired at baseline and who had received ketamine were more likely to develop postoperative delirium, suggesting that cognitive vulnerability might be predicted by the lack of a neurophysiologic response to ketamine.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of the study was to investigate the association of postoperative delirium with the outcomes of cognitive impairment, functional disability and death. METHODS: Hip surgery patients aged 60 years or over (n = 200) underwent preoperative and daily postoperative assessment of their cognitive status during hospital stay. Outcome variables were determined at an average of 8 and 38 months after discharge from hospital. RESULTS: Fourty-one patients developed postoperative delirium. Delirium was a strong independent predictor of cognitive impairment and the occurrence of severe dependency in activities of daily living. The associations were more marked for the long- than for the short-term outcome. Thirty-eight months after discharge from hospital, 53.8{\%} of the surviving patients with postoperative delirium suffered from cognitive impairment, as compared to only 4.4{\%} of the nondelirious participants. Logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, medical comorbidity and preoperative cognitive performance revealed highly significant associations between delirium and cognitive impairment (OR = 41.2; 95{\%} CI = 4.3-396.2), subjective memory decline (OR = 6.2; 95{\%} CI = 1.5-25.8) and incident need for long-term care (OR = 5.6; 95{\%} CI = 1.6-19.7). CONCLUSION: The present study confirms a poor prognosis after delirium in elderly patients. The findings suggest that delirium does not simply persist for a certain time but also predicts a future cognitive decline with an increased risk of dementia.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Proximal femur fractures are most common fractures in the elderly and associated with significant mortality and morbidity, with high economic and social impact. Perioperative pain management influence outcomes and mortality after surgery with early mobilization being possible. The goal of the study was to compare the efficacy and safety of the psoas compartment block (PCB) with spinal and general anesthesia. METHODS: We included 90 patients in this randomized controlled study and divided them into three groups. For patients in group 1 ultrasound-guided PCB with bupivacaine 0.125{\%} 6-8 ml / h was performed. Intraoperative anesthesia was provided with PCB and a sciatic nerve block. Postoperative analgesia include prolonged CPB with bupivacaine 0.125{\%} 6-8 ml / h. In group 2 intraoperative spinal anaesthesia were performed. Group 3 patients underwent general sevoflurane inhalation anaesthesia with fentanyl infusion for analgesia. All patients received paracetamol 3 g/day and dexketoprofen 75 mg/day during hospitalization. On-demand, nalbuphine 5 mg SC was used for analgesia. Efficacy outcomes were the ICU length of stay and the total duration of hospitalization, number of patients who had severe pain after surgery, incidence of on-demand analgesia, sleep quality, postoperative mobilization time. Safety outcomes include complication incidence. RESULTS: There were no differences in the duration of ICU stay - gr.1 72 {$[$}70-75{$]$}, gr.2 74 {$[$}72-76{$]$}, gr.3 72 {$[$}70-75{$]$} hours respectively (p = 0.29), and the total duration of hospitalization - gr.1144 {$[$}170-184{$]$}, gr.2170 {$[$}148-188{$]$}, gr.3178 {$[$}144-200{$]$} hours respectively. Patients in gr.1 had significantly lower nalbuphine consumption in the first 24 h after surgery and total during hospitalization (0 {$[$}0-5{$]$} mg versus 15 {$[$}10-20{$]$} and 20 {$[$}15-25{$]$} mg in the first 24 h in groups 2 and 3, respectively (p < 0.001). Gr. 1 had lower number of patients with severe pain (10{\%} vs. 47 and 60{\%} in groups 2 and 3, respectively, p < 0.05), lower number of on demand analgesia (0 {$[$}0-1{$]$} vs. 3 {$[$}2-4{$]$} and 4 {$[$}3, 4{$]$} in groups 2 and 3, respectively), better sleep quality (8 {$[$}7-9{$]$} vs. 6 {$[$}5-7{$]$} and 4 {$[$}3, 4{$]$} in groups 2 and 3, respectively, p < 0.001), significantly faster mobilization after surgery - sitting in bed and getting to his feet. MINS was diagnosed significantly more often in gr. 2 and 3 compared with gr. 1 (OR 9 95 CI 1,01-77, p = 0,048 for gr. 2 and OR 11 95 CI 1,2-91, p = 0, 03 for gr. 3). However, none of the patients had symptoms of myocardial ischemia and was not diagnosed with myocardial infarction. There were no difference in the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia and delirium. CONCLUSION: Perioperative PCB in elderly patients with a proximal femur fracture could be an effective analgesia technique, as it decrease the number of patients with severe pain, need for on demand analgesia and opioid consumption. PCB also decrease the incidence of opioid-associated nausea and vomiting, comparing to general anesthesia, and increase the number of patients, who was mobilized in the 1st day (sitting) and 2nd day (getting up) after surgery. PCB may reduce the incidence of MINS, although to assess this outcome more studies are needed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04648332 , first registration date 1/12/2020.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is an evident need for improved management of elderly patients with trauma in order to avoid common and troublesome complications such as delirium. The aim of this study was to investigate whether an implementation of a multi-factorial program including intensified pre-hospital and perioperative treatment and care could reduce the incidence of delirium in elderly patients with hip fracture, cognitively intact at admission to the hospital. In addition, we explored the factors that characterize patients who developed delirium. METHODS: A prospective, quasi-experimental design was used. A total of 263 patients with hip fracture (> or = 65 years), cognitively intact at admission, were consecutively included between April 2003 and April 2004. On 1 October 2003, a new program was introduced. All patients were screened for cognitive impairment within 30 min after admission to the emergency department using The Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ). To screen for delirium, patients were tested within 4 h of admission and thereafter daily, using the Organic Brain Syndrome scale. RESULTS: The number of patients who developed delirium during hospitalization was 74 (28.1{\%}), with a decrease from 34{\%} (45 of 132) in the control group to 22{\%} (29 of 131) in the intervention group (P=0.031). Patients who developed delirium were statistically older, more often had > 4 prescribed drugs at admission and scored less well in the SPMSQ test. CONCLUSION: The use of a multi-factorial intervention program in elderly hip fracture patients, lucid at admission, reduced the incidence of delirium during hospitalization by 35{\%}.},

@article{Bornemann-Cimenti2016,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence confirms that perioperative ketamine administration decreases opioid usage. To reduce the risk for potential psychodysleptic side effects, however, ketamine dosing tends to be limited to low-dose regimens. We hypothesized that even lower doses of ketamine would be sufficient, with minimal side effects, when used as a component of multimodal perioperative pain management. METHODS: In this triple-blinded, randomized, active- and placebo-controlled clinical trial, patients undergoing elective major abdominal surgery were randomized to one of three treatment groups: low-dose S-ketamine (a 0.25 mg/kg bolus and 0.125 mg/kg/h infusion for 48 hours), minimal-dose S-ketamine (a 0.015 mg/kg/h infusion following a saline bolus), and placebo (saline bolus and infusion). Opioid consumption, pain levels, hyperalgesia at the incision site, and delirium scores were assessed 48 h postoperatively. RESULTS: Patients in the placebo group had the highest cumulative piritramide consumption and the largest normalized areas of hyperalgesia at the incisional site, while those in the low-dose group had the highest delirium scores. Postoperative pain levels did not differ significantly between the treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that minimal-dose S-ketamine was comparable to the conventional low-dose regimen in reducing postoperative opioid consumption and hyperalgesia. Postoperative delirium, however, was less frequent with the minimal-dose regimen. We therefore suggest that minimal-dose S-ketamine may be a useful low-risk component of balanced perioperative analgesia.},

@article{Braude2017,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of introducing and embedding a structured geriatric liaison service, Proactive care of Older People undergoing Surgery (POPS)-Urology, using comprehensive geriatric assessment methodology, on an inpatient urology ward. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A phased quality improvement project was undertaken using stepwise interventions. Phase 1 was a before-and-after study with initiation of a daily board round, weekly multidisciplinary meeting, and targeted geriatrician-led ward rounds for elective and emergency urology patients aged ≥65 years admitted over two 1-month periods. Outcomes were recorded from medical records and discharge documentation, including length of inpatient stay, medical and surgical complications, and 30-day readmission and mortality rates. Phase 2 was a quality improvement project involving Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles and qualitative staff surveys in order to create a Geriatric Surgical Checklist (GSCL) to standardize the intervention in Phase 1, improve equity of care by extending it to all ages, improve team-working and streamline handovers for multidisciplinary staff. RESULTS: Phase 1 included 112 patients in the control month and 130 in the intervention month. The length of inpatient stay was reduced by 19{\%} (mean 4.9 vs 4.0 days; P = 0.01), total postoperative complications were lower (risk ratio 0.24 {$[$}95{\%} confidence interval 0.10, 0.54{$]$}; P = 0.001). A non-significant trend was seen towards fewer cancellations of surgery (10 vs 5{\%}; P = 0.12) and 30-day readmissions (8 vs 3{\%}; P = 0.07). In Phase 2, the GSCL was created and incrementally improved. Questionnaires repeated at intervals showed that the GSCL helped staff to understand their role better in multidisciplinary meetings, improved their confidence to raise issues, reduced duplication of handovers and standardized identification of geriatric issues. Equity of care was improved by providing the intervention to patients of all ages, despite which the time taken for the daily board round did not lengthen. CONCLUSION: This is the first known paper describing the benefits of daily proactive geriatric intervention in elective and emergency urological surgery. The results suggest that using a multidisciplinary team board round helps to facilitate collaborative working between surgical and geriatric medicine teams. The GSCL enables systematic identification of patients who require a focused comprehensive geriatric assessment. There is potential to transfer the GSCL package to other surgical specialties and hospitals to improve postoperative outcomes.},

@article{Brown2021,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reducing depth of anesthesia and anesthetic exposure may help prevent delirium, but trials have been conflicting. Most studies were conducted under general anesthesia or in cognitively impaired patients. It is unclear whether reducing depth of anesthesia beyond levels consistent with general anesthesia reduces delirium in cognitively intact patients. The authors' objective was to determine whether a bundled approach to reduce anesthetic agent exposure as determined by Bispectral Index (BIS) values (spinal anesthesia with targeted sedation based on BIS values) compared with general anesthesia (masked BIS) reduces delirium. METHODS: Important eligibility criteria for this parallel-arm randomized trial were patients 65 yr or greater undergoing lumbar spine fusion. The intervention group received spinal anesthesia with targeted sedation to BIS greater than 60 to 70. The control group received general anesthesia (masked BIS). The primary outcome was delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method daily through postoperative day 3, with blinded assessment. RESULTS: The median age of 217 patients in the analysis was 72 (interquartile range, 69 to 77). The median BIS value in the spinal anesthesia with targeted sedation based on BIS values group was 62 (interquartile range, 53 to 70) and in the general anesthesia with masked BIS values group was 45 (interquartile range, 41 to 50; P < 0.001). Incident delirium was not different in the spinal anesthesia with targeted sedation based on BIS values group (25.2{\%} {$[$}28 of 111{$]$} vs. the general anesthesia with masked BIS values group (18.9{\%} {$[$}20 of 106{$]$}; P = 0.259; relative risk, 1.22 {$[$}95{\%} CI, 0.85 to 1.76{$]$}). In prespecified subgroup analyses, the effect of anesthetic strategy differed according to the Mini-Mental State Examination, but not the Charlson Comorbidity Index or age. Two strokes occurred among patients receiving spinal anesthesia and one death among patients receiving general anesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: Spinal anesthesia with targeted sedation based on BIS values compared with general anesthesia with masked BIS values did not reduce delirium after lumbar fusion. EDITOR'S PERSPECTIVE:},

@article{Burfeind2022,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Beers Criteria is an explicit list of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) best avoided in adults ≥65 years of age. Cognitively impaired and frail surgical patients often experience poor outcomes after surgery, but the impacts of PIMs on these patients are unclear. Our objective was to assess whether perioperative PIM administration was associated with poor outcomes in geriatric surgical patients. We then evaluated the association between PIM administration and postoperative outcomes in subgroups of patients who were frail or cognitively impaired. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients ≥65 years of age who underwent elective inpatient surgery at a large academic medical center from February 2018 to January 2020. Edmonton Frail Scale and Mini-Cog screening tools were administered to all patients at their preoperative clinic visit. A Mini-Cog score of 0 to 2 was considered cognitive impairment, and frailty was defined by an Edmonton Frail Scale score of ≥8. Patients were divided into 2 groups depending on whether they received at least 1 PIM (PIM+), based on the 2019 AGS Beers Criteria, in the perioperative period or none (PIM-). We assessed the association of preoperative frailty, cognitive impairment, and perioperative PIM administration with the length of hospital stay and discharge disposition using multiple regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, ASA physical status, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. RESULTS: Of the 1627 included patients (mean age, 73.7 years), 69.3{\%} (n = 1128) received at least 1 PIM. A total of 12.7{\%} of patients were frail, and 11.1{\%} of patients were cognitively impaired; 64{\%} of the frail patients and 58{\%} of the cognitively impaired patients received at least 1 PIM. Perioperative PIM administration was associated with longer hospital stay after surgery (PIM-, 3.56 $\pm$5.2 vs PIM+, 4.93 $\pm$5.66 days; P < .001; 95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$}, 0.360-0.546). Frail patients who received PIMs had an average length of stay (LOS) that was nearly 2 days longer than frail patients who did not receive PIMs (PIM-, 4.48 $\pm$5.04 vs PIM+, 6.33 $\pm$5.89 days; P = .02). Multiple regression analysis revealed no significant association between PIM administration and proportion of patients discharged to a care facility (PIM+, 26.3{\%} vs PIM-, 28.7{\%}; P = .87; 95{\%} CI, -0.046 to 0.054). CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative PIM administration was common in older surgical patients, including cognitively impaired and frail patients. PIM administration was associated with an increased hospital LOS, particularly in frail patients. There was no association found between PIM administration and discharge disposition.},

The authors also explored association between apolipoprotein E4 and postoperative cognitive dysfunction in patients undergoing general anesthesia. METHODS: A total of 2,000 patients were equally and randomly divided into intravenous and inhalation anesthesia groups. Total intravenous and inhalation anesthesia were used. Within 10 days after surgery, cognitive function was assessed daily using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Restriction fragment length polymorphism of apolipoprotein E gene was analyzed. The primary outcome was MMSE score, frequency distribution of apolipoprotein E alleles and genotypes. P < 0.01 was used as statistically significant. RESULTS: MMSE score in inhalation preoperative baseline group significantly decreased at day 3 after surgery compared with the preoperational and intravenous anesthesia group. The proportion of patients scoring less than 25 points was significantly greater in the inhalation anesthesia group than in the intravenous anesthesia group at 3 days after surgery. In the inhalation anesthesia group, the decrease in MMSE score was closely related with apolipoprotein E ε4 allele. In the intravenous anesthesia group, the decrease in MMSE score was not correlated with apolipoprotein E ε4 allele. CONCLUSIONS: There was a strong association between the apolipoprotein E ε4 and postoperative cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients undergoing inhalation anesthetics.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chemotherapeutic stop-flow perfusion is a new investigational treatment for locally advanced cancers that is usually performed under general anesthesia (GA), and, less frequently, under spinal anesthesia (SA). We designed this clinical trial to compare the clinical profiles of GA and SA for stop-flow perfusion. METHODS: Anesthesia and recovery times, scores on visual analog scales for postoperative pain, and postoperative nausea and vomiting, and admission to the postanesthesia care unit were measured in 40 cancer patients who randomly received either GA with propofol, nitrous oxide/sevoflurane, and fentanyl, or SA with bupivacaine hydrochloride for lower limb or pelvic stop-flow perfusion. RESULTS: GA and SA did not differ in times to achieve home readiness or patient satisfaction. Compared with GA, SA significantly (P < 0.05) reduced anesthesia times (34 vs 16 min), postoperative visual analog scale scores for pain (5 vs 0) and nausea (8 vs 2), and the number of admissions to the postanesthesia care unit (9 vs 0). CONCLUSIONS: For stop-flow perfusion, GA and SA are both effective, but SA provides faster recovery, superior analgesia, and less postoperative nausea and vomiting in the immediate postoperative period.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: This prospective, randomized study was conducted to compare unilateral spinal block using small doses of hyperbaric bupivacaine and single-agent anaesthesia with sevoflurane in elderly patients undergoing hip surgery. METHODS: Thirty patients (> 65 yr) undergoing hip fracture repair were randomly allocated to receive unilateral spinal anaesthesia with hyperbaric bupivacaine 7.5 mg 0.5{\%} (Group Spinal, n = 15) or volatile induction and maintenance anaesthesia with sevoflurane (Group SEVO, n = 15). General anaesthesia was induced by increasing the inspired concentration to 5{\%}. A laryngeal mask airway was placed without muscle relaxants, and the end-tidal concentrations of sevoflurane were adjusted to maintain cardiovascular stability. Hypotension (decrease in systolic arterial pressure > 20{\%} from baseline), hypertension or bradycardia (heart rate < 50 beats min(-1)) requiring treatment, and the length of stay in the postanaesthesia care unit was recorded. Cognitive functions were evaluated the previous day, and 1 and 7 days after surgery with the Mini Mental State Examination test. RESULTS: Hypotension occurred in seven patients of Group Spinal (46{\%}) and in 12 patients of Group SEVO (80{\%}) (P = 0.05). Phenylephrine was required to control hypotension in three spinal patients (21{\%}) and four SEVO patients (26{\%}) (n.s.). SEVO patients had lower heart rates than spinal patients from 15 to 60 min after anaesthesia induction (P = 0.01). Bradycardia was observed in three SEVO patients (22{\%}). Discharge from the postanaesthesia care unit required 15 (range 5-30) min in Group Spinal and 55 (15-80) min in Group SEVO (P = 0.0005). Eight patients in Group Spinal (53{\%}) and nine patients in Group SEVO (60{\%}) showed cognitive decline (Mini Mental State Examination test decreased > or = 2 points from baseline) 24 h after surgery (n.s.). Seven days after surgery, confusion was still present in one patient of Group Spinal (6{\%}) and in three patients of Group SEVO (20{\%}) (n.s.). CONCLUSIONS: In elderly patients undergoing hemiarthroplasty of the hip, induction and maintenance with sevoflurane provide a rapid emergence from anaesthesia without more depression of postoperative cognitive function compared with unilateral spinal anaesthesia. This technique represents an attractive option when patient refusal, lack of adequate co-operation or concomitant anticoagulant therapy contraindicate the use of spinal anaesthesia.},

	abstract = {Introduction: In this study we aimed to compare the recovery characteristics of propofol/remifentanil and sevofluran/remifentanil anesthesia in 100 geriatric patients undergo-ing urological procedures. Materials and Method: The patients were randomized to receive either propofol-remifen-tanil (group P) or sevoflurane-remifentanil (Group S) anesthesia. Recovery characteristics, the time to post-anesthetic discharge scoring system (PADSS) score and Aldrete score of 9 point, Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) and Trieger Dot Test (TDT)values were compared between two groups. Results: Extubation time was significantly shorter in group P than in group S (5.3+2.9 min vs 7.8+3.8 min, p=0.038). The times of first eye opening, response to verbal commands and ori-entation were similar in both groups. The time of Aldrete score of 9 points (grup P: 14.2+3.6 min, group S: 16.3+4.5 min) and PADSS of 9 points (group P: 19.3+5.7 min, group S: 22.1+4.2 min) were also similar (p{$>$}0.05). Time to return to the normal value of DSST was significantly shorter in Group P compared with Group S, and TDT was similar in both groups (p{$>$}0.05). No sig-nificant differences were observed in the incidence of postoperative complications and VAS score (p{$>$}0.05). Conclusion: Both propofol-remifentanil and sevoflurane-remifentanil appears to be an ade-quate anesthesia in geriatric patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a poorly understood complication particularly observed in elderly patients, with long-term poor outcome. The randomised study was to compare the incidence of POCD in elderly with bispectral index (BIS)-guided intra-operative use of either dexmedetomidine or propofol with sevoflurane. METHODS: Eighty-seven patients, planned for non-cardiac surgery under general anaesthesia, were included between June 2017 and March 2018. After exclusion of 7 patients, remaining 80 patients were randomised into dexmedetomidine group and propofol group with 40 patients each. In both the groups, BIS-guided anaesthesia was provided. Cognitive function was assessed by an anaesthesiologist using a battery of neuropsychological tests at baseline pre-operatively, third and seventh day after surgery. The data were entered into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21. RESULTS: Propofol group had a non-significant lower incidence of POCD on third day and dexmedetomidine group showed decreased incidence of POCD on seventh day, accompanied by lower anaesthetic requirement (inhalational as well as intravenous) concomitant with delayed emergence with an acceptable BIS value. CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine appeared to be anaesthetic sparing as compared to propofol. BIS monitoring for titrating depth of anaesthesia and hence the anaesthetic exposure is an invaluable tool as compared to routine care anaesthesia for reducing POCD. The patients in both groups did not develop significant POCD until the seventh post-operative day.},

	abstract = {This paper uses a neural network model to study the protective effect of dexmedetomidine on the anesthesia recovery period and neurocognitive function in elderly patients undergoing radical resection of colorectal cancer. Eighty-eight patients with colorectal cancer who underwent radical surgery in our hospital from January 2015 to June 2017 were randomly divided into groups: study (43 cases) and control (45 cases). The study group was treated with dexmedetomidine for anesthesia. Patients in the study group were given a slow pumping dose of 1 μg/kg to prepare dexmedetomidine at a dose of 1 μg/kg. The pumping time was >10 minutes, and the dose was 0.3 μg after completion. The loading dose of 0.3 (kg·h) was maintained intraoperatively; the control group was given the same amount of saline infusion by the same infusion method. The study found that the probability of cognitive dysfunction in the study group was significantly lower than that in the control group, and the degree of cognitive dysfunction in the study group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05). Therefore in the operation of elderly patients with colorectal cancer radical surgery, dexmedetomidine is used for anesthesia to protect postoperative cognitive function and reduce the incidence of cognitive dysfunction.

	abstract = {Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is performed with increasing frequency in aging populations. However, in elderly patients, cognitive dysfunction following surgery may impair the outcome of surgical procedures. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) has been demonstrated to have a neuroprotectve effect in animal experiments. However, it is unclear whether DEX also has a neuroprotective effect in human patients. The present study was a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind trial of 126 patients who had undergone laparoscopic cholecystectomy, using clinical interviews to determine whether intravenously administrated DEX during general anesthesia ameliorates cognitive function impairment. The cognitive deficit of each patient was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The scores on the MMSE for the DEX and control groups one week after surgery (DEX group, 27.6$\pm$1.2; control group, 25.7$\pm$1.5) were significantly different (P=0.005). The MMSE scores of patients ≤65 years old were significantly higher than those of patients >65 one week after surgery. The MMSE scores were significantly different between the two age groups in the control patients (≤65 years old, 28.3$\pm$1.2; >65 years old, 26.6$\pm$2.1; P=0.036), while the difference was not statistically significant in the DEX-treated patients. Eight patients in the DEX group and 15 patients in the control group had mild cognitive impairment (26≥MMSE score ≥21) although the difference was not statistically significant. The findings of the present study support the hypothesis that DEX administration may be an effective method for ameliorating postoperative cognitive impairment in elderly patients who have undergone laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Further research is required to confirm the findings of the present study.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study examined recovery, delirium, and neurocognitive outcome in elderly patients receiving dexmedetomidine or propofol sedation after undergoing cardiac surgery. DESIGN: Open-label randomized trial. SETTING: Single center. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 70 patients older than 75 years without English language limitations and Mini Mental State Examination scores >20. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received either propofol (group P) or dexmedetomidine (group D) postoperatively until normothermic and hemodynamically stable. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Quality of recovery (QoR) was measured by the QoR-40 questionnaire on postoperative day (POD) three. Secondary outcomes were incidence and duration of delirium, time to extubation, length of hospital stay, hospital mortality rate, postoperative quality of life (QoL; measured by SF-36 performed at baseline and six months postoperatively), and neurocognitive disorder (measured by Minnesota Cognitive Acuity Screen {$[$}MCAS{$]$} performed at baseline, POD5, and six months postoperatively). A total of sixty-seven patients completed the trial. There was no significant difference in QoR-40 scores (95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$}, -7.6081-to-10.9781; p=1.000), incidence of delirium (group P, 42{\%}; group D, 24{\%}; p=0.191), mean hospital stay (95{\%} CI, -5.4838-to-1.5444; p=0.297), mean time to extubation (95{\%} CI, -19.2513-to-7.5561; p=0.866), or mean duration of delirium (95{\%} CI, -4.3065-to-1.067; p=0.206) between groups. No patients died in the hospital. There were no significant differences in changes in SF-36 or MCAS scores over time between groups. There was a decline in MCAS score from preoperatively to POD5 in group P (95{\%} CI, -8.95725-to- -2.61775; p=0.0005), which was greater than that observed in group D. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' findings demonstrated that the use of dexmedetomidine compared with propofol in elderly patients undergoing cardiac surgery was unlikely to improve QoR/postoperative QoL.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To determine whether the anesthetic method of propofol total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) is associated with postoperative outcome in ESRD patients, we evaluated the incidence of postoperative major adverse cardiac events (MACE), comparing propofol TIVA versus anesthesia with volatile anesthesia in ESRD patients. METHODS: Retrospectively, we identified cases with ESRD patients who underwent surgery under general anesthesia. Patients were divided into those who received only volatile anesthesia (volatile group) and those who received only propofol TIVA (TIVA group). The incidence of MACE and potential confounding variables were compared separately in a univariate logistic model and subsequently by multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Among the 2576 cases in ESRD patients, 1374 were in the TIVA group and 1202 were in the volatile group. The multivariate analysis included 12 factors, including the anesthesia method, of which five factors were significant. Factors that were associated with a significantly lower MACE risk included preoperative chloride concentration (OR: 0.96; 95{\%} CI, 0.92-0.99), baseline SBP (OR: 0.98; 95{\%} CI, 0.98-0.99), and propofol TIVA (OR: 0.37; 95{\%} CI, 0.22-0.60). CONCLUSIONS: We inferred that the anesthetic method associated with the postoperative outcome in patients with ESRD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute lung injury (ALI) is the most serious pulmonary complication after lung resection. Although the beneficial effects of low-dose corticosteroids have been demonstrated in patients with postoperative ALI, there are limited data on optimal corticosteroid treatment. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 58 patients who were diagnosed with ALI among 7593 patients who underwent lung cancer surgery between January 2009 and December 2016. RESULTS: Of the 58 patients, 42 (72{\%}) received corticosteroid treatment within 72 h (early treatment group) and 16 (28{\%}) received corticosteroid treatment more than 72 h after ALI occurred (late treatment group). The early treatment group demonstrated a higher response to corticosteroid treatment compared with the late treatment group (95{\%} versus 69{\%}, respectively, p = 0.014), had an improved lung injury score (86{\%} versus 63{\%}, p = 0.072), and were more likely to be successfully weaned from the ventilator within 7 days (57{\%} versus 39{\%}, p = 0.332). During corticosteroid treatment, the early treatment group had a lower rate of delirium (24{\%} versus 63{\%}, p = 0.012) compared with the late treatment group. No significant differences in length of stay (30 versus 37 days, p = 0.254) or in-hospital mortality (43{\%} versus 38{\%}, p = 0.773) were observed; however, the early treatment group tended to have a higher rate of successful weaning than the late treatment group ( p = 0.098, log-rank test). CONCLUSIONS: Early initiation of corticosteroid treatment improved lung injury and promoted ventilator weaning in patients with ALI following lung resection for lung cancer.},

	abstract = {Objective. To compare postoperative outcomes in patients having primary total knee arthroplasty receiving general or regional anaesthesia. Design. Randomised prospective study. Setting. Regional hospital, Hong Kong. Patients. Patients having primary total knee replacement were randomised to either general anaesthesia followed by postoperative intravenous patient-controlled analgesia with morphine, or combined spinal-epidural anaesthesia followed by postoperative epidural infusion of bupivacaine 0.1{\%} with fentanyl 2 μg/mL. Main outcome measures. Visual analogue scale pain scores, perioperative blood loss, time to first meal and ambulation, and prevalence of postoperative complications. Results. Sixty consecutive patients were enrolled in this study. Postoperative median pain scores were consistently lower at 1 (P<0.0001), 6 (P=0.08), 12 (P=0.003), 24 (P=0.14), and 48 hours (P=0.007) in those given regional anaesthesia. Although there was a trend towards fewer complications in the latter group, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups with respect to the incidence of postoperative blood loss, haemodynamic instability, pruritus, nausea, vomiting, urinary retention, or other surgical/ medical complications. Postoperatively, patients given regional anaesthesia also resumed meals earlier (P<0.0001), and showed a trend towards earlier ambulation and hospital discharge. Conclusion. Chinese patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty with regional anaesthesia/regionally delivered analgesia enjoyed better postoperative pain relief and resumed meals earlier than those receiving general anaesthesia/intravenous patient-controlled analgesia. The former also showed trends towards less adverse effects, postoperative complications, earlier ambulation, and earlier hospital discharge.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Volatile anesthesia possesses cardioprotective properties, and it is widely used in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, but no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are available on the use of sevoflurane-remifentanil versus propofol-remifentanil anesthesia for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) during noncardiac surgery. This study was designed to compare the 2 different types of general anesthesia in patients with CAD undergoing noncardiac surgery at a single center. MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients with CAD undergoing noncardiac surgery were enrolled in an RCT conducted between March 2016 and December 2017. The participants were randomized to receive either sevoflurane-remifentanil or propofol-remifentanil anesthesia. The primary endpoint was occurrence of in-hospital cardiovascular events. The secondary endpoints included delirium, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), Intensive Care Unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), in-hospital morbidity and mortality, and hospital LOS. RESULTS A total of 164 participants completed the study (sevoflurane: 81; propofol: 83). The occurrence of in-hospital cardiovascular events did not differ between the 2 groups (42.6{\%} vs 39.4{\%}, P=0.86). The occurrence of delirium did not differ between the 2 groups after the operation. PONV had a higher frequency after sevoflurane anesthesia at 48 h compared with propofol. In-hospital morbidity and mortality, ICU LOS, and hospital LOS were similar between the 2 groups (all P>0.05). At 30 days after surgery, no between-group differences in cardiac morbidity and mortality were observed. CONCLUSIONS In this study, anesthesia using sevoflurane-remifentanil did not provide additional postoperative cardioprotection in comparison with propofol-remifentanil in patients with CAD undergoing noncardiac surgery.},

@article{Jonghe2014,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Disturbance of the sleep-wake cycle is a characteristic of delirium. In addition, changes in melatonin rhythm influence the circadian rhythm and are associated with delirium. We compared the effect of melatonin and placebo on the incidence and duration of delirium. METHODS: We performed this multicentre, double-blind, randomized controlled trial between November 2008 and May 2012 in 1 academic and 2 nonacademic hospitals. Patients aged 65 years or older who were scheduled for acute hip surgery were eligible for inclusion. Patients received melatonin 3 mg or placebo in the evening for 5 consecutive days, starting within 24 hours after admission. The primary outcome was incidence of delirium within 8 days of admission. We also monitored the duration of delirium. RESULTS: A total of 452 patients were randomly assigned to the 2 study groups. We subsequently excluded 74 patients for whom the primary end point could not be measured or who had delirium before the second day of the study. After these postrandomization exclusions, data for 378 patients were included in the main analysis. The overall mean age was 84 years, 238 (63.0{\%}) of the patients lived at home before admission, and 210 (55.6{\%}) had cognitive impairment. We observed no effect of melatonin on the incidence of delirium: 55/186 (29.6{\%}) in the melatonin group v. 49/192 (25.5{\%}) in the placebo group; difference 4.1 (95{\%} confidence interval -0.05 to 13.1) percentage points. There were no between-group differences in mortality or in cognitive or functional outcomes at 3-month follow-up. INTERPRETATION: In this older population with hip fracture, treatment with melatonin did not reduce the incidence of delirium.

@article{Deiner2014,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (PD) is a prevalent complication of elderly surgical patients, which predisposes to worsened cognitive recovery and dementia. Risk of PD has been associated with increasing magnitude of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal stress response (serum cortisol, epinephrine and norepinephrine) to surgery. Anesthetics suppress this response; however, some (total intravenous anesthesia, TIVA) more than others (anesthetic gases). Prior comparisons of anesthetics have been equivocal but have not included stress markers. We hypothesized that TIVA would decrease serum stress markers and the incidence of PD. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of 76 elderly major surgical patients. Patients received TIVA or sevoflurane gas, and blood was drawn for serum markers pre-, intra-, and postoperatively. PD was assessed with the Confusion Assessment Method. We compared stress markers and PD between patients who received TIVA versus sevoflurane, and then modeled PD including stress and anesthetic. RESULTS: The group that received TIVA during surgery demonstrated lower levels of all stress markers compared to the gas group, but no difference in PD. However, across groups, the postoperative norepinephrine level was much higher in patients who developed PD. Other markers and other times had no effect. CONCLUSION: The development of PD depends more on postoperative stress than intraoperative stress or anesthetic.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Postoperative delirium occurs in 10{\%} to 60{\%} of elderly patients having major surgery and is associated with longer hospital stays, increased hospital costs, and 1-year mortality. Emerging literature suggests that dexmedetomidine sedation in critical care units is associated with reduced incidence of delirium. However, intraoperative use of dexmedetomidine for prevention of delirium has not been well studied. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether an intraoperative infusion of dexmedetomidine reduces postoperative delirium. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that randomly assigned patients to dexmedetomidine or saline placebo infused during surgery and for 2 hours in the recovery room. Patients were assessed daily for postoperative delirium (primary outcome) and secondarily for postoperative cognitive decline. Participants were elderly (>68 years) patients undergoing major elective noncardiac surgery. The study dates were February 2008 to May 2014. INTERVENTIONS: Dexmedetomidine infusion (0.5 µg/kg/h) during surgery and up to 2 hours in the recovery room. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary hypothesis tested was that intraoperative dexmedetomidine administration would reduce postoperative delirium. Secondarily, the study examined the correlation between dexmedetomidine use and postoperative cognitive change. RESULTS: In total, 404 patients were randomized; 390 completed in-hospital delirium assessments (median {$[$}interquartile range{$]$} age, 74.0 {$[$}71.0-78.0{$]$} years; 51.3{\%} {$[$}200 of 390{$]$} female). There was no difference in postoperative delirium between the dexmedetomidine and placebo groups (12.2{\%} {$[$}23 of 189{$]$} vs 11.4{\%} {$[$}23 of 201{$]$}, P = .94). After adjustment for age and educational level, there was no difference in the postoperative cognitive performance between treatment groups at 3 months and 6 months. Adverse events were comparably distributed in the treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Intraoperative dexmedetomidine does not prevent postoperative delirium. The reduction in delirium previously demonstrated in numerous surgical intensive care unit studies was not observed, which underscores the importance of timing when administering the drug to prevent delirium.

@article{Deiner2015,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a serious and costly complication of the elderly; even mild impairment has the potential to impact overall well being. Anesthesiologists continue to search for ways to manipulate intraoperative technique to optimize postoperative cognition in the elderly. Depth of anesthesia during surgery is an area that has shown some promise for short-term outcomes, such as delirium. However, excessive depth has both positive and negative associations with longer-term POCD. We hypothesize that this uncertainty is due to the inability of median depth to capture the amount of burst suppression or electrical silence. In this study, our purpose was to identify the intraoperative processed EEG parameters that are most closely correlated with POCD. METHODS: To explore the association of several processed EEG parameters with POCD, we performed a retrospective analysis of a cohort of 105 patients aged >68 years scheduled for major surgery under general anesthesia. Intraoperative medications, hemodynamics, processed EEG and cerebral oxygen saturation were recorded. All patients had a cognitive battery before surgery and repeated at 3 months afterward. FINDINGS: One hundred and five patients enrolled and 77 (73.3{\%}) patients completed the 3-month cognitive testing. The incidence of POCD was 27{\%}; the median Bispectral Index value for patients who developed POCD was similar to patients who did not (46 vs 42 minutes). However, patients who developed POCD spent less time with Bispectral Index <45 minutes (82.8 vs 122.5 minutes, P = 0.01) and burst suppression (35 vs 96 minutes, P = 0.04). Hypotension, cerebral desaturation, and use of total intravenous anesthesia were similar between patients with and without POCD. IMPLICATIONS: Patients who developed POCD spent less time in EEG burst suppression and less time in deep states. Burst suppression may be protective for POCD. Further work is needed to definitively identify the role of burst suppression in the context of other patient and intraoperative variables to prevent POCD.},

@article{Dianatkhah2015,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative neurological injuries, including cognitive dysfunction, sleep disorder, delirium, and anxiety, are the important consequences of coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Evidence has shown that postoperative sleep disturbance is partly due to disturbed melatonin secretion in the perioperative period. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of melatonin on postoperative sleep disorder in patients undergoing CABG. METHOD: One hundred forty-five elective CABG patients participated in a randomized double-blind study during the preoperative period. The patients were randomized to receive either 3 mg of melatonin or 10 mg of Oxazepam one hour before sleep time. Each group received the medication from 3 days before surgery until the time of discharge. Sleep quality was evaluated using the Groningen Sleep Quality Score (GSQS), and the incidence of delirium was evaluated by nursing records. Sleep quality and anxiety scores were compared before and after surgery through the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and independent t-test were used to compare the sleep and anxiety scores between the groups. P values </= 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Totally, 137 patients at a mean age of 60 years completed the study (76{\%} male). The analysis of the data showed that sleep was significantly disturbed after surgery in both groups. The patients in the Oxazepam group demonstrated significantly higher disturbance in their mean postoperative GSQS score than did their counterparts in the melatonin group (p value < 0.001). A smaller proportion of the participants experienced delirium in the melatonin group (0.06{\%}) than in the Oxazepam group (0.12{\%}); however, this difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The result of the present study revealed that melatonin improved sleep in post-cardiac surgery patients more than what was observed with Oxazepam. Therefore, melatonin may be considered an effective alternative for Benzodiazepines in the management of postoperative sleep disorder.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Prophylactic corticosteroids are often administered during cardiac surgery to attenuate the inflammatory response to cardiopulmonary bypass and surgical trauma; however, evidence that routine corticosteroid use can prevent major adverse events is lacking. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the effect of intraoperative high-dose dexamethasone on the incidence of major adverse events in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 4494 patients aged 18 years or older undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass at 8 cardiac surgical centers in The Netherlands enrolled between April 13, 2006, and November 23, 2011. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to receive a single intraoperative dose of 1 mg/kg dexamethasone (n = 2239) or placebo (n = 2255). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, or respiratory failure, within 30 days of randomization. RESULTS: Of the 4494 patients who underwent randomization, 4482 (99.7{\%}) could be evaluated for the primary outcome. A total of 157 patients (7.0{\%}) in the dexamethasone group and 191 patients (8.5{\%}) in the placebo group reached the primary study end point (relative risk, 0.83; 95{\%} CI, 0.67-1.01; absolute risk reduction, -1.5{\%}; 95{\%} CI, -3.0{\%} to 0.1{\%}; P = .07). Dexamethasone was associated with reductions in postoperative infection, duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation, and lengths of intensive care unit and hospital stays. In contrast, dexamethasone was associated with higher postoperative glucose levels. CONCLUSION: In our trial of adults undergoing cardiac surgery, the use of intraoperative dexamethasone did not reduce the 30-day incidence of major adverse events compared with placebo.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is one of the main causes of morbidity after noncardiac surgery; however, the pathogenic mechanisms of POCD have remained unclear until now. In this study, we performed a pilot study to investigate the association between apolipoprotein E (ApoE) epsilon4 and POCD in older patients undergoing intravenous anesthesia (IVA) and inhalation anesthesia (IAA). METHODS: In total, 180 patients from Shenzhen People's Hospital were recruited and randomly divided into an IVA group and an IAA group. The IVA group and IAA group received propofol and sevoflurane treatment, respectively. Within 7 days after surgery, the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) was used daily to assess the cognitive function of both groups of patients. The genotypes of the ApoE gene were detected using the restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. In addition, the serum levels of (soluble protein-100beta) S100beta and (Interleukin- 6) L6 were also analyzed. RESULTS: Compared to the preoperative and IVA groups, the MMSE score in the IAA group significantly decreased at 3 days after surgery. Furthermore, the IAA group had a higher percentage of patients who scored less than 25 points than the IVA group at 3 days after surgery. The decrease in the MMSE score was closely related to the ApoE epsilon4 allele in the IAA group, but this correlation was not observed in the IVA group. The levels of S100beta and IL6 were increased sharply in patients with the epsilon4/epsilon4 genotype who received IAA compared with IVA at 1 day after surgery. CONCLUSION: The results of the study indicated that the ApoEpsilon epsilon4/epsilon4 genotype was a risk factor for early POCD in older patients undergoing sevoflurane anesthesia.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of dexmedetomidine on anesthesia recovery period and postoperative cognitive function of patients after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy and ileal conduit diversion. METHODS: A total of 40 elective patients who would undergo robot-assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy and ileal conduit diversion. They were randomly divided into two groups in a double-blind manner. After pneumoperitoneum established, all patients adopted 40$\,^{\circ}$trendelenberg position. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and bispectral index (BIS) of each patient were recorded at four moments respectively, namely the end of surgery (T0), palinesthesia (T1), extubation (T2), 10 min after extubation (T3). RESULTS: In the dexmedetomidine group, the mean arterial pressure and heart rate decreased at T1 and T2 compared with controls (P<0.05); in addition, the delirium rating scale was lower than the latter (P<0.05) while Ramsay sedation score was significantly higher (P<0.05). POCD was observed on 28 patients, containing 17 controls and 11 dexmedetomidine individuals, one day after operation, and 21 patients (12 controls, 9 dexmedetomidine people) five days after operation. One- and five-day after operation, the levels of TNF-α, NSE and IL-6 in the dexmedetomidine group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.05), and serum SOD significantly increased in the former (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine had a neuroprotective effect on anesthesia recovery and postoperative period of the elderly patients undergone robot-assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy, which might be related to the reduction of inflammatory reaction induced by dexmedetomidine.},

	abstract = {In order to investigate the effects of Dexmedetomidine (DEX) on postoperative anesthesia recovery time and consciousness function in elderly patients with laparoscopic colorectal tumors, 40 patients (20 in the control group and 20 in the DEX group) were selected. The DEX group was intravenously pumped at a rate of 0.8 μg/kg/h for 10 min and then continuously pumped at a rate of 0.3 μg/kg/h until 40 min before the end of the operation. The two groups were given the same amount of normal saline, with the same way of anesthesia. The results showed that the visual analog scale (VAS) score of pain in the two groups decreased signally. Compared with the control group, the inflammatory factors tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukin-1β(IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP-2) in the DEX group were remarkably decreased at T1 and T2 stages, with a considerable difference (P < 0.05). One month after the auxiliary diagnosis of colorectal tumor, no clear nodular, irregular shape patches, or patchy diffuse limited points were found, which indicated that the whole tumor had been removed. In summary, DEX could improve postoperative cognitive function in elderly patients who underwent the laparoscopic radical resection of colon cancer, and its mechanism was related to the reduction of inflammatory factors. Therefore, the anesthesia intervention with DEX during the operation had a positive significance for tumor resection.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a serious complication after cardiac surgery. Use of dexmedetomidine to prevent delirium is controversial. The authors hypothesized that dexmedetomidine sedation after cardiac surgery would reduce the incidence of POD. METHODS: After institutional ethics review board approval, and informed consent, a single-blinded, prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted in patients 60 yr or older undergoing cardiac surgery. Patients with a history of serious mental illness, delirium, and severe dementia were excluded. Upon admission to intensive care unit (ICU), patients received either dexmedetomidine (0.4 μg/kg bolus followed by 0.2 to 0.7 μg kg h infusion) or propofol (25 to 50 μg kg min infusion) according to a computer-generated randomization code in blocks of four. Assessment of delirium was performed with confusion assessment method for ICU or confusion assessment method after discharge from ICU at 12-h intervals during the 5 postoperative days. Primary outcome was the incidence of POD. RESULTS: POD was present in 16 of 91 (17.5{\%}) and 29 of 92 (31.5{\%}) patients in dexmedetomidine and propofol groups, respectively (odds ratio, 0.46; 95{\%} CI, 0.23 to 0.92; P = 0.028). Median onset of POD was on postoperative day 2 (1 to 4 days) versus 1 (1 to 4 days), P = 0.027, and duration of POD 2 days (1 to 4 days) versus 3 days (1 to 5 days), P = 0.04, in dexmedetomidine and propofol groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: When compared with propofol, dexmedetomidine sedation reduced incidence, delayed onset, and shortened duration of POD in elderly patients after cardiac surgery. The absolute risk reduction for POD was 14{\%}, with a number needed to treat of 7.1.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate efficacy of combined use of parecoxib and dexmedetomidine on postoperative pain and early cognitive dysfunction after laparoscopic cholecystectomy for elderly patients. METHODS: The present prospective randomized controlled study included a total of 80 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgery during January 2016 to November 2017 in our hospital. All patients were randomly divided into 4 groups, the parecoxib group, the dexmedetomidine group, the parecoxib and dexmedetomidine combined group, and the control group. Demographic data and clinical data were collected. Indexes of heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), levels of jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjvO2) and jugular venous oxygen pressure (PjvO2) were recorded at different time points before and during the surgery. The mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score, Ramsay score and Visual Analogue Score (VAS) were measured. RESULTS: Levels of both SjvO2 and PjvO2 were significantly higher in parecoxib group, dexmedetomidine group and the combined group than the control group. Meanwhile, levels of both SjvO2 and PjvO2 in the combined group were the highest. VAS scores were significantly lower in the combined group than all other groups, and total patient controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) pressing times within 48 h after surgery were the lowest in the combined group. Both Ramsay and MMSE scores were the highest in the combined group compared with other groups, while were the lowest in the control group. CONCLUSION: The combined use of parecoxib and dexmedetomidine could reduce the postoperative pain and improve the postoperative sedation and cognitive conditions of patients after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium is frequent in older adults and is associated with postoperative neurocognitive disorder (PND). Studies evaluating perioperative medication use and delirium have generally evaluated medications in aggregate and been poorly controlled; the association between perioperative medication use and PND remains unclear. We sought to evaluate the association between medication use and postoperative delirium and PND in older adults undergoing major elective surgery. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study of adults >/=70 years without dementia undergoing major elective surgery. Patients were interviewed preoperatively to determine home medication use. Postoperatively, daily hospital use of 7 different medication classes listed in guidelines as risk factors for delirium was collected; administration before delirium was verified. While hospitalized, patients were assessed daily for delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method and a validated chart review method. Cognition was evaluated preoperatively and 1 month after surgery using a neurocognitive battery. The association between prehospital medication use and postoperative delirium was assessed using a generalized linear model with a log link function, controlling for age, sex, type of surgery, Charlson comorbidity index, and baseline cognition. The association between daily postoperative medication use (when class exposure >/=5{\%}) and time to delirium was assessed using time-varying Cox models adjusted for age, sex, surgery type, Charlson comorbidity index, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE)-II score, and baseline cognition. Mediation analysis was utilized to evaluate the association between medication use, delirium, and cognitive change from baseline to 1 month. RESULTS: Among 560 patients enrolled, 134 (24{\%}) developed delirium during hospitalization. The multivariable analyses revealed no significant association between prehospital benzodiazepine (relative risk {$[$}RR{$]$}, 1.44; 95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$}, 0.85-2.44), beta-blocker (RR, 1.38; 95{\%} CI, 0.94-2.05), NSAID (RR, 1.12; 95{\%} CI, 0.77-1.62), opioid (RR, 1.22; 95{\%} CI, 0.82-1.82), or statin (RR, 1.34; 95{\%} CI, 0.92-1.95) exposure and delirium. Postoperative hospital benzodiazepine use (adjusted hazard ratio {$[$}aHR{$]$}, 3.23; 95{\%} CI, 2.10-4.99) was associated with greater delirium. Neither postoperative hospital antipsychotic (aHR, 1.48; 95{\%} CI, 0.74-2.94) nor opioid (aHR, 0.82; 95{\%} CI, 0.62-1.11) use before delirium was associated with delirium. Antipsychotic use (either presurgery or postsurgery) was associated with a 0.34 point (standard error, 0.16) decrease in general cognitive performance at 1 month through its effect on delirium (P = .03), despite no total effect being observed. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of benzodiazepines to older adults hospitalized after major surgery is associated with increased postoperative delirium. Association between inhospital, postoperative medication use and cognition at 1 month, independent of delirium, was not detected.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a serious complication associated with total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and has been shown to increase the length of hospital stay, cause functional impairment, and morbidity. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine whether POCD is associated with the use of general or regional anesthesia in patients undergoing TKA. Our hypothesis was that POCD would be reduced in the group that received regional analgesia without any sedations. Our secondary hypothesis was POCD would be associated with biomarkers of surgical stress. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled study between general and spinal anesthesia. SETTING: Single-centered, university hospital, from January to October 2017. METHODS: A total of 112 patients were assessed for eligibility, and a total of 57 patients completed the study. We divided the patients into general and regional anesthesia groups. Blood samples were obtained preoperatively at the first intraoperative, the third and the 24th postoperative hour. C-reactive protein (CRP), cortisol, insulin, and blood glucose levels were tested. We used 4 neurocognitive tests that were administered 1 day before operation, 7 days and 30 days after operation. Main outcome measures were neurocognitive tests scores for regional anesthesia without sedation and general anesthesia groups. Cortisol, glucose, insulin, and CRP levels. RESULTS: Patients who received regional anesthesia showed significantly higher Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scored compared with the general anesthesia at the seventh day (P = 0.037). In the general anesthesia group, patients showed significantly higher variations for the Stroop number difference. There were negative correlations between MMSE scores measured at postoperative day 7 and the 1-hour intraoperative cortisol measurements (r = -0.302; P = 0.022) and 3-hour postoperative cortisol measurements (r = -0.295; P = 0.026). LIMITATIONS: A limitation was the small number of patients. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that regional anesthesia results in better neurocognitive test scores than general anesthesia in patients undergoing TKA. Patients who received regional anesthesia showed lower cortisol, higher insulin, and lower glucose levels. We recommend that patients who undergo arthroplasty surgeries should receive regional anesthesia to avoid POCD at the early stages of the postoperative period.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: One-lung ventilation (OLV) may impair cerebral oxygen balance and induce postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). It is unclear whether the type of anesthetic influences the incidence of POCD in patients undergoing OLV. This prospective study compared the incidence of POCD and intraoperative cerebral oxygen desaturation in OLV patients anesthetized with propofol vs sevoflurane during lung surgery. METHODS: There were 148 participants enrolled in this study and randomized equally to either the propofol or the sevoflurane group. Anesthesia was maintained with either propofol or sevoflurane combined in both groups with fentanyl and epidural anesthesia. Regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2), jugular bulb venous oxygen saturation (SjO2), and the incidence of cerebral oxygen desaturation (rSO2 or SjO2 < 50{\%} or rSO2 < 80{\%} of baseline) were measured during anesthesia. Cognitive function was assessed using seven neurocognitive tests two days preoperatively, five days postoperatively (primary outcome), and three months postoperatively. Bivariable and multivariable regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with POCD. RESULTS: Rates of POCD did not differ statistically between groups five days postoperatively (propofol, 16/72 patients; sevoflurane, 24/72 patients; RR, 0.67; 95{\%} CI, 0.39 to 1.15; P = 0.14) or three months postoperatively (propofol, 9/60 patients; sevoflurane, 12/58 patients; RR, 0.73; 95{\%} CI, 0.33 to 1.59; P = 0.42). Only three subjects per group showed intraoperative cerebral oxygen desaturation. Multivariable regression analysis revealed older age as an independent predictor of POCD. CONCLUSIONS: No statistically significant difference in the incidence of POCD could be detected between the sevoflurane and propofol anesthesia groups. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction was relatively frequent following OLV in both groups. ( REGISTRATION NUMBER: UMIN 000002826).},

	abstract = {Background: delirium is a common complication after cardiac surgical procedures and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Postoperative delirium is associated with an increased length of stay in the intensive care unit, long hospital stay and high hospital charges. Aim of the Work: to investigate the effectiveness of melatonin as a preoperative sedative as well as the preventive and the curative effect of melatonin supplementation in elderly patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery on postoperative delirium. Patients and Methods: this prospective, randomized, controlled, double blind study was conducted on a total of 50 patients allocated into 2 equal groups. It was conducted in Ain Shams University hospitals, in the cardiothoracic surgery unit. Results: melatonin has superior sedative effect at 30 min preoperatively compared with placebo (P=0.022). Melatonin succeeded to treat about 56{\%} of delirious patients. The incidence of delirium was 8{\%} in the melatonin group vs. 28{\%} in the control group (P= 0.046). In univariate analysis, predictors of delirium in both groups were age (P= 0.049 in melatonin group, P=0.021 in control group), higher fentanyl dose (P= 0.021 in melatonin group, P=0.047 in control group), lower ejection fraction (P= 0.018 in melatonin group, P=0.008 in control group), longer cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) times (P= 0.026 in melatonin group, P=0.04 in control group) and longer aortic cross clamping (ACC) times (P= 0.04 in melatonin group, P=0.019 in control group). Conclusion: administration of melatonin significantly decreased the incidence of postoperative delirium (POD) after coronary artery bypass grafting in elderly patients and significantly increased preoperative sedation. Advanced age, higher total intraoperative fentanyl dose, lower ejection fraction and longer CPB and ACC times were independent predictors of POD with or without melatonin supplementation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: We evaluated the costs and benefits of total intravenous anaesthesia compared with a balanced anaesthesia regimen. METHODS: One-hundred and twenty-four patients undergoing cataract surgery were randomized to either a propofol/remifentanil or an isoflurane/fentanyl group. In the propofol/remifentanil group, both drugs were used for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia; in the isoflurane/fentanyl group, anaesthesia was induced with etomidate and fentanyl and maintained with isoflurane and fentanyl. All patients received mivacurium for muscle relaxation and the lungs were ventilated mechanically. The use of propofol and remifentanil resulted in a faster emergence and an overall savings per case of {$[$}symbol: see text{$]$} 12.25 due to a reduction in personnel costs which outweighs the higher drug acquisition costs. RESULTS: In the propofol and remifentanil group, more patients were satisfied and would accept the same anaesthetic again. CONCLUSION: We conclude that propofol and remifentanil is more cost-effective than isoflurane/fentanyl due to its better recovery profile, reduced total direct costs and higher patient satisfaction.},

@article{Ernst2014,
	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: The need for integrating palliative care into surgical services has been established within the surgical literature. The ability to effectively screen, obtain an appropriately timed consultation, and determine the effect of consultation remains problematic. OBJECTIVE: To examine surgical palliative care consultations over time and their relationship to the initiation and implementation of a systemwide frailty-screening program. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We reviewed all surgical palliative care consultations performed between January 1, 2006, and August 31, 2013, and abstracted the referring service (medicine/surgery), date of surgery (if any), date of death (if any), and all variables required to calculate a frailty score using the risk analysis index. We examined changes in mortality and referral patterns before and after implementation of the frailty-screening program using multivariable logistic regression. EXPOSURES: Surgical palliative care consultations, including frailty screening. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary study outcomes were 30-, 180-, and 360-day mortality. RESULTS: From 2006 to 2013, a total of 310 palliative care consultations were ordered for surgical patients: 160 before initiation of frailty screening (January 1, 2011) and 150 after initiation of the program. The groups had similar demographics, comorbidities, and frailty scores. After initiation, we observed dramatically decreased mortality at 30, 180, and 360 days (21.3{\%} vs 31.9{\%}, 44.0{\%} vs 70.6{\%}, and 66.0{\%} vs 78.8{\%}, respectively; all P < .05). This coincided with an increased rate of palliative care consultations from 32 per year to 56 per year. After initiation of the program, consultations were more likely to be requested by surgeons (56.7{\%} vs 24.4{\%}; P < .05) and were more likely to occur before the index operation (52.0{\%} vs 26.3{\%}; P < .05). Implementation of the screening program was associated with a 33{\%} reduction in 180-day mortality (odds ratio {$[$}OR{$]$}, 0.37; 95{\%} CI, 0.22-0.62; P < .001) even after controlling for age, frailty, and whether the patients had surgery. Modeled mortality was also reduced when the palliative care consultation was ordered by a surgeon (OR, 0.50; CI, 0.30-0.83; P = .007) or ordered before the operation (OR, 0.52; CI, 0.30-0.90; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our data suggest that a systematic frailty-screening program effectively identifies at-risk surgical patients and is associated with a significant reduction in mortality for patients undergoing palliative care consultation. Analysis also suggests that preoperative palliative care consultations ordered by surgeons are associated with reduced mortality rates.},

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate the effect of dexmedetomidine on the postoperative cognitive function of patients undergoing radical resection of esophageal cancer. Methods: A total of 76 patients undergoing radical resection of esophageal cancer were randomly and equally divided into observation and control groups. The patients in the two groups were then treated with continuous intravenous pumping of fentanyl to ease their pain. In the control group, the patients were initially treated with 0.05 mg/kg and then with 0.02-0.08 mg/kg*h-1 rhythim to remain anesthetized. In the observation group, the patients were intravenously infused with 1.0 µg/kg dexmedetomidine and then with 0.2-0.7 µg/kg*h-1 to retain their anesthetized conditions. The sedative effect and incidence of adverse reactions in these patients were compared. Results: The sedative effects did not significantly differ between the two groups (P>0.05). The recovery time after the drug was withdrawn from the patients in the observation group was significantly shorter than that in the control group (P<0.05). The incidence of adverse reactions in the observation group was 13.16{\%}, which was significantly lower than that in the control group (39.47{\%}; P<0.05). The postoperative SDS and SAS scores of the patients in the two groups were significantly higher than their preoperative scores (P<0.05). The postoperative SDS and SAS scores of the patients in the observation group were also significantly higher than those in the control group (P<0.05). Conclusion: The sedative effect of dexmedetomidine on patients subjected to general anesthesia and undergoing radical resection of esophageal cancer was good. Dexmedetomidine could improve the cognitive function of patients and reduce the incidence of adverse reactions. Therefore, this drug should be recommended for these patients.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether exogenous melatonin supplementation could ameliorate early postoperative cognitive decline (POCD) in aged patients undergoing hip arthroplasty with spinal anesthesia. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Department of Anesthesiology, Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China. PATIENTS: One hundred and thirty-nine patients with ASA I-III, older than 65yr of age (mean age: 74.5$\pm$5.5; gender: male 53 and female 86), scheduled for hip arthroplasty were included in the present study. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to receive 1mg oral melatonin or placebo daily 1h before bedtime one day before surgery and for another 5 consecutive days postoperatively. MEASUREMENTS: The subject assessment, including Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, subjective sleep quality, general well-being, postoperative fatigue, and visual analogue scale for pain were evaluated pre-operatively and at days 1, 3, 5, and 7 after surgery. MAIN RESULTS: The MMSE score in the control group decreased significantly after surgery when compared with its own preoperative value or the melatonin group at days 1, 3, and 5. However, the MMSE score in the melatonin group remained unchanged during the 7days of monitoring. In addition, significant postoperative impairments of subjective sleep quality, general well-being, and fatigue were found in the control group when compared with the melatonin group. CONCLUSION: Peroperative melatonin supplementation might improve early POCD, suggesting restoration of normal circadian function with good sleep quality may be one of the key factors in preventing or treating POCD.},

	abstract = {Background: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common complication after surgery. The present study compared the effects of sevoflurane and propofol on POCD in old patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery under general anesthesia. Methods: Sixty patients over 65-year-old candidates for elective laparotomy were randomly assigned into two groups of anesthesia with sevoflurane or propofol. Baseline assessment of cognitive function was done 12-24 hours before surgery and the second to fourth tests were done at 6-12, 18-24, and 42-48 hours after surgery, respectively. Results: The mean age, gender and the mean time of surgery were equal in two groups. Postoperative cognitive function in sevoflurane group was significantly better than propofol group in the 6-12 (p<0.03) and 12-24 (p<0.03) hours after surgery but the assessment of the two groups in 24-48 hours after surgery showed similar conditions. Discussion: The results of this study showed that anesthesia with sevoflurane creates less cognitive disorders than anesthesia with propofol in patients without cerebrovascular complications or surgical procedures that involve the brain's blood flow. {\copyright}2017, American University of Beirut.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Delirium is a serious medical condition with increased incidence in at-risk surgical populations. We sought to determine if melatonin use reduces the incidence of delirium in individuals undergoing major cardiac surgery. DESIGN: Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial (two arms, 1:1 allocation, parallel design). SETTING: The trial took place in two metropolitan hospitals (public tertiary and private) in Perth, Western Australia. PARTICIPANTS: We recruited 210 adults aged 50 years or older who were due to undergo coronary artery bypass grafting or valve replacement surgery. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to 7 days of treatment with melatonin 3 mg at night or matching placebo, starting 2 days before the surgery. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome of interest was incident delirium within 7 days of surgery as assessed via daily clinical assessment that included the Confusion Assessment Method. Secondary outcomes of interest included duration and severity of delirium, length of hospital stay, cognitive function, and mood and anxiety symptoms at discharge and 3 months after the surgery. RESULTS: The groups were well balanced for demographic and clinical parameters. Forty-two participants developed delirium, but it was evenly distributed between the groups (melatonin 21/98, 21.4{\%}; placebo 21/104, 20.2{\%}; adjusted odds ratio {$[$}OR{$]$} = .78; 95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$} = .35-1.75). The median duration of delirium was 3 (interquartile range {$[$}IQR{$]$} = 2-4) and 2 (IQR = 1-3) days for people treated with melatonin and placebo, respectively (z = -1.03; P = .304). A similar proportion of participants experienced severe episodes of delirium in each group (melatonin 9/21, 42.9{\%} vs placebo 6/21, 28.6{\%}; χ(2) = .93; P = .334; adjusted OR = 1.98; 95{\%} CI = .40-9.78). The groups did not differ in terms of length of stay, mood, anxiety, and cognitive performance. CONCLUSION: The findings of this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial do not support the prophylactic use of melatonin to prevent delirium after major cardiac surgery.

	abstract = {AIM: The aim of this randomized clinical trial was to compare patients treated using a multimodal approach {$[$}enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS){$]$}, with a special focus on counselling, to patients treated in a standard conventional care pathway, who underwent elective colorectal resection. METHOD: In a single-centre trial, adult patients eligible for open or laparoscopic colorectal resection were randomized to an ERAS programme or standard care. The primary end-point was postoperative total hospital stay. Identical discharge criteria were defined for both treatment groups. Secondary end-points included postoperative complications, postoperative C-reactive protein levels, postoperative hospital stay, readmission rate and mortality. All parameters were recorded before operation, on the day of surgery and daily thereafter until discharge. RESULTS: Total hospital stay was significantly shorter among patients randomized to ERAS than among the standard group {$[$}median 5 days (range 2-50 days) vs median 8 days (range 2-48 days); P = 0.001{$]$}. The two treatment groups exhibited similar outcomes regarding overall major and minor morbidity, reoperation rate, readmission rate and 30-day mortality. There were also no differences in tolerance of enteral nutrition or in the inflammatory response, as reflected by postoperative C-reactive protein levels. CONCLUSION: ERAS care was associated with a significantly shorter length of hospital stay. Without any difference in surgical or general complications, tolerance of enteral nutrition or postoperative C-reactive protein levels, peri-operative information and guidance for ensuring that patients comply with the ERAS approach appear to be important factors to reduce the length of hospital stay.},

	abstract = {PURPOSES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the early administration haloperidol in preventing the aggravation of postoperative delirium in elderly patients. METHODS: A total of 201 patients (age >/=75 years) who underwent elective surgery were enrolled. The patients were divided into two groups: the intervention group (n = 101) received prophylactic haloperidol (5 mg); the control group (n = 100) did not. Haloperidol was administered daily during postoperative days 0-5 to the patients who presented with NEECHAM scores of 20-24 when measured at 18:00. The primary endpoint was the incidence of severe postoperative delirium. RESULTS: The incidence of severe postoperative delirium in all patients was 25.1{\%}. The incidence of severe postoperative delirium in the intervention group (18.2{\%}) was significantly lower than that in the control group (32.0{\%}) (p = 0.02). The difference between the two groups was larger when the analysis was limited to the 70 patients who had NEECHAM scores of 20-24 for at least one day during postoperative days 0-5. No adverse effects of the haloperidol were observed. CONCLUSION: The prophylactic administration of haloperidol at the early stage of delirium significantly reduced the incidence of severe postoperative delirium in elderly patients.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Postoperative delirium is the most common postoperative complication in the elderly. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the preventive administration of low-dose haloperidol on the development of postoperative delirium after abdominal or orthopedic surgery in elderly patients. SUBJECTS: A total of 119 patients aged 75 years or older who underwent elective surgery for digestive or orthopedic disease were included in this study. METHODS: Patients were divided into those who did (intervention group, n = 59) and did not (control group, n = 60) receive 2.5 mg of haloperidol at 18:00 daily for 3 days after surgery; a randomized, open-label prospective study was performed on these groups. The primary endpoint was the incidence of postoperative delirium during the first 7 days after the operation. RESULTS: The incidence of postoperative delirium in all patients was 37.8{\%}. No side effects involving haloperidol were noted; however, the incidences of postoperative delirium were 42.4 and 33.3{\%} in the intervention and control groups, respectively, which were not significantly different (p = 0.309). No significant effect of the treatment was observed on the severity or persistence of postoperative delirium. CONCLUSIONS: The preventive administration of low-dose haloperidol did not induce any adverse events, but also did not significantly decrease the incidence or severity of postoperative delirium or shorten its persistence.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To study the effect of dexmedetomidine (Dex) on the expression of Neuroglobin (Ngb) and postoperative cognitive function in elderly patients undergoing minimally invasive coronary artery bypass surgery. METHODS: Forty patients, who underwent elective minimally invasive off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting in our hospital from January 2018 to December 2019, were randomly divided into the Dex group (N = 20) and control group (N = 20). Venous blood samples were taken to determine the expression level of Ngb in both groups. Mini mental status examination (MMSE) was used to detect the cognitive function of patients. RESULTS: The expression level of Ngb in the Dex group was significantly higher than that in the control group at 6h after one-lung ventilation and postoperative 24h (P < .01). The MMSE score of the Dex group was significantly higher than the control group at postoperative 7 days and postoperative 30 days (P < .01). Although with no statistical significance, the MMSE score of the Dex group was higher than the control group at postoperative 90 days (P > .05). The incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in the Dex group was significantly lower than that in the control group at postoperative 7 days and postoperative 30 days (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Dex used in elderly patients undergoing minimally invasive coronary artery bypass graft surgery can effectively increase the expression level of Ngb and reduce the incidence of POCD.},

	abstract = {The present study aimed to investigate the effects of dexmedetomidine (DEX) on cognition following a carotid endarterectomy (CEA). In addition, the neuroprotective effects of DEX against ischemia-reperfusion injury during CEA were analyzed. Patients due to undergo elective CEA under general anesthesia were randomly assigned to either the DEX-treated group (group D; n=25) or the control group (group C; n=25). Patients in group D were treated with 0.3 μg/kg DEX pre-CEA, followed by 0.3 μg/kg/h DEX intraoperatively up to 30 min prior to the completion of surgery, and the patients in group C received an equal volume of normal saline. Cognitive function was assessed prior to CEA (T0), and at 24, 48, and 72 h, 7 days and 1 month post-surgery (T1-5, respectively), using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Blood samples were drawn from the ipsilateral jugular bulb of all patients at 20 min prior to anesthesia (t0), and at 10 min following tracheal intubation, 15 min following clamping and unclamping of the carotid artery, and at 6 and 24 h postoperatively (t1-5, respectively). The protein expression levels of markers of cerebral ischemia and injury, namely S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and the concentration of the oxidative stress marker malondialdehyde (MDA), were analyzed. Patients in group D exhibited elevated MMSE scores at T2 and T3 post-CEA, as compared with group C. Furthermore, the protein expression level of S100B and the concentration of MDA in the jugular bulb of group D patients were markedly decreased compared with those in group C at t3-5 and t3, respectively. The results of the present study suggested that DEX was able to enhance the recovery of cognition following CEA, and this was associated with decreased cerebral damage and antioxidative effects.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in elderly surgical patients (>60years) receiving different anesthetics (propofol, sevoflurane, or isoflurane) and to identify potential biomarkers of POCD in this patient population. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial. SETTING: University-affiliated teaching hospital. PATIENTS: One hundred and fifty elderly patients scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. INTERVENTIONS: Elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomly assigned to receive propofol, sevoflurane, or isoflurane anesthesia. MEASUREMENTS: Cognitive function was assessed using neuropsychological tests at baseline (1day before surgery {$[$}D0{$]$}), and on postoperative day 1 (D1) and day 3 (D3). Plasma S-100beta and Abeta(1-40) protein, IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha concentrations were assessed before induction of anesthesia (T0), after extubation (T1), and 1h (T2) and 24h (T3) postoperatively. MAIN RESULTS: The incidence of POCD was significantly lower in the propofol group compared to the isoflurane group and the sevoflurane group at D1 and D3 (propofol vs. isoflurane: D1 and D3, P<0.001; propofol vs. sevoflurane: D1, P=0.012; D3, P=0.013). The incidence of POCD was significantly lower in the sevoflurane group compared to the isoflurane group at D1 (P=0.041), but not at D3. Postoperatively, plasma S-100beta and Abeta(1-40) protein, IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha concentrations were significantly decreased in the propofol group compared to the isoflurane group.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of geriatric comanagement on clinical outcomes of older patients undergoing surgery for gastrointestinal cancer. DESIGN: This was a single-center, nonrandomized, before-and-after study, which compared patient outcomes before and after the implementation of geriatric comanagement in an oncological surgery division. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The study included patients aged 70 or older, who were treated for a gastrointestinal cancer at the Oncological Surgery Division of the Policlinico San Martino Hospital (Genoa, Italy). Patients from the control group were treated between January 2015 and October 2018, and the patients who received geriatric comanagement during their stay in the surgical ward were treated between November 2018 and December 2019. METHODS: Patients from both groups received a preoperative comprehensive geriatric assessment in the preoperative phase and were followed according to the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery model in the perioperative period. In the geriatric comanagement group, targeted interventions during daily geriatrician-led ward rounds were performed. Inverse probability weighting was used to adjust estimates for potential baseline confounders. RESULTS: A total of 207 patients were included: 107 in the control group and 90 who received geriatric comanagement. Overall, patients from both groups had similar demographic and clinical characteristics with a median {$[$}interquartile range (IQR){$]$} age of 80.0 (77.0, 84.0) years and a pre-frail phenotype {$[$}median (IQR) 40-item Frailty Index 0.15 (0.10, 0.26){$]$}. In the geriatric comanagement group, a significant reduction in grade I-V complications (adjusted odds ratio 0.29; 95{\%} CI 0.21-0.40); P {$<$} .001) and in 1-year readmissions (adjusted hazard ratio 0.53; 95{\%} CI 0.28-0.98; P {$<$} .044) was observed. No difference between the 2 groups in terms of 1-year mortality was detected. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our study supports the implementation of geriatric comanagement in the care of older patients undergoing surgery for gastrointestinal cancer.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative cognitive decline (POCD), a very common complication after cardiac surgery, is characterised by impairment of both memory function and intellectual ability as well as being associated with increased use of healthcare resources. The investigators focused on the role of the inflammatory response to a surgical procedure as a potential factor involved in the pathogenesis of POCD. OBJECTIVE: The use of prophylactic dexamethasone to attenuate the inflammatory response was hypothesised to reduce the risk of POCD. DESIGN: Randomised controlled study. SETTING: Single university teaching hospital, from March 2015 to January 2016. PATIENTS: A total of 169 patients scheduled for elective cardiac surgery were enrolled, and 161 patients were included in the analyses. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomised to receive a single intravenous bolus of 0.1 mg kg dexamethasone (n = 85) or placebo (n = 84) 10 h before the surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure in both groups was the incidence of POCD on the 6th day after surgery. The investigators also evaluated the effect of dexamethasone on the incidence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, postoperative C-reactive protein levels and postoperative serum S100βprotein levels. RESULTS: Compared to the placebo group, the dexamethasone group showed statistically significant reductions in the incidence of POCD (relative risk, 0.43; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.21 to 0.89; P = 0.02), the incidence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (30.0 versus 58.0{\%}, P < 0.001) and postoperative C-reactive protein levels (P < 0.001). Postoperative S100βlevels were insignificantly lower (P = 0.56) in the dexamethasone group. CONCLUSION: Preoperative administration of dexamethasone reduced the inflammatory response and thereby decreased the risk of early POCD after cardiac surgery.

@article{Goins2018,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Investigate the effect of volatile anesthesia versus total intravenous anesthesia on the incidence of postoperative delirium and length of stay in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement under general anesthesia. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Single institution, academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement under general anesthesia between November 2014 and February 2017. INTERVENTIONS: This study was not an interventional study. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Electronic medical records were reviewed for intraoperative maintenance anesthetic technique, hospital and intensive care unit length of stay, 30-day mortality, and documentation of delirium. Delirium was defined as either 1) positive Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit score or 2) documentation of delirium or confusion by the care team within 2 days of surgery. Overall, 116 patients were included and 84 (72{\%}) received a total intravenous anesthesia technique. Twenty-three patients (20{\%}) had postoperative delirium. The odds of delirium were lower in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement with total intravenous anesthesia, compared with volatile anesthesia, even after adjusting for procedure approach (odds ratio 0.22, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.06, 0.79, p = 0.02). No significant difference in hospital or intensive care unit length of stay was seen after adjusting for procedural characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: While postoperative delirium is a complex and multifactorial problem, the type of general anesthetic maintenance may contribute to the incidence of postoperative delirium in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement, and total intravenous anesthesia may be an attractive alternative to volatile-based general anesthesia maintenance.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim was to compare the feasibility of ultrasound-guided multiple nerve blocks (fascia iliaca compartment block+sacral plexus block+superior cluneal nerve block) with general anesthesia in geriatric hip fracture patients. METHODS: Ninety-four patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: group N received ultrasound-guided multiple nerve blocks and group G received general anesthesia. Primary outcome measures included perioperative Pain Threshold Index (PTI) and Numerical Rating Scale. Secondary outcome measures comprised the following: (1) perioperative Delirium Index and Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire; (2) perioperative Comfort Index; (3) perioperative opioid consumption (within 72 hours postoperatively); and (4) postoperative side effects (within 72 h postoperatively). RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients completed the study. Baseline PTI was comparable between the groups. However, intraoperative PTI was significantly lower in group N than in group G. Preoperative and postoperative Comfort Index scores were comparable between the groups. Moderate delirium (24 to 72 h postoperatively) was significantly higher than the baseline in group G. Early moderate delirium (24 h postoperatively) was significantly higher in group G than in group N. Severe delirium was comparable between the groups and within each group. High intraoperative PTI was associated with high opioid consumption. The intravenous sufentanil dose in group G was twice of that in group N. Incidence of nausea and vomiting was similar between the groups. DISCUSSION: Ultrasound-guided multiple nerve blockade may be an alternative to the common anesthetic procedures used for geriatric hip fracture patients. It provided satisfactory intraoperative pain management and reduced early postoperative cognitive disorders.},

	abstract = {This study analyzed the preventive effects of low-dose dexmedetomidine on postoperative cognitive function and recovery quality in elderly oral cancer patients by observing the perioperative kinetics of inflammatory cytokines, cortisol and melatonin.A total of 149 elderly oral cancer patients who had undergone tumor resection surgery were selected and randomly divided into 2 groups, Group D and Group S. After surgery, Group D was assigned to take intravenous dexmedetomidine at a dose of 0.2 μg/kg/h for 12 h, while Group S was administered physiological saline in the same manner. On the day of surgery and for the first three postoperative days, the patients were assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and a 40-item quality of recovery score questionnaire (QoR40) at 7:00 am every morning. Venous blood was harvested at the same time. Then, IL-6, CRP, cortisol and melatonin levels were measured. There were no significant between-group differences in the baseline characteristics. After surgery, the MMSE and QoR40 scores in Group D were better than those in Group S. No between-group differences were observed in the incidences of severe hypotension and bradycardia. Moreover, respiratory depression was not observed in the 2 groups. The peaks of IL-6, CRP and cortisol concentrations in Group D were lower than those in Group S. However, the melatonin levels did not differ between the 2 groups. In elderly patients, intravenous dexmedetomidine administered postoperatively for 12 h at a dose of 0.2 ug/kg/h could improve postoperative cognitive function and recovery quality by decreasing excessive inflammation and stress levels.},

@article{Gupta2019,
	abstract = {Introduction: Delirium is known as an acute mental disturbance characterised by confused thinking and disrupted attention that is usually accompanied by disordered speech and hallucination. Delirium often is seen in patients post-surgery. Use of Melatonin pre-operatively decreases the incidence of post-operative delirium. Ramelteon is an agonist of melatonin having longer half-life than melatonin. Aim: To evaluate the efficacy of Ramelteon for the prevention of post-operative delirium in elderly patients. Materials and Methods: In this randomised controlled double-blind (all places) study, 50 patients with ASA I and II were selected and randomly assigned to each group. Group I received one tablet of Ramelteon (8 mg) 12 hours before surgery and 1 tablet of Ramelteon (8 mg) 1 hour before surgery and Group II received placebo one tablet 12 hours before surgery and 1 tablet 1 hour before surgery. Incidence of delirium was assessed by Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) at 1st, 2nd and 3rd day. The SPSS Version 21.0 was used for the statistical analyses and p-value <0.05 was considered as significant. The Chi-square test was used to compare the categorical variables between the groups. Unpaired t-test was used to compare the continuous variables between the groups. Results: Only two patients developed delirium in Ramelteon group, one patient at Day 2 and one patient at Day 3; but in control group, six patients develop delirium, three patients at day two and three patients at Day 3. The incidence of delirium in Ramelteon group was lower in comparison with placebo group but it was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Thus, it was observed that Ramelteon administration in pre-operative period decreases (non-significantly) the incidence of post-operative delirium with higher sedation scores. So Ramelteon can be recommended in the patients having high risk of developing post-operative delirium.},

Methods: In this randomized double blind trial 100 patients (50 patients in each group) older than 60 years under hip surgery were randomized in general anesthesia with sevoflurane and spinal anesthesia with lidocaine 5{\%}. Hemodynamic changes including mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate, blood loss, pain severity, nausea and vomiting and opioids consumption were compared in two groups. Results: During surgery, difference between two groups regarding changes in mean arterial pressure was not significant, but the changes in heart rate were significantly different. Mean arterial pressure changes during recovery between two groups were significantly different. But there was no significant difference in heart rate changes. Bleeding in the sevoflurane group was significantly more than spinal group (513.ml vs. 365 ml). Moreover, AS Score, opioid consumption, and the nausea and vomiting in spinal anesthesia group was significantly lower than the sevoflurane group. Conclusion: We showed that general anesthesia with sevoflurane and spinal anesthesia with low dose lidocaine 5{\%} have comparable effects on hemodynamics changes in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. However postoperative pain score, vomiting and morphine consumption in patients with spinal anesthesia were lower than general anesthesia.},

@article{Hakim2012,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this randomized, parallel-arm trial was to study the effect of treating subsyndromal delirium with risperidone on the incidence of clinical delirium in elderly patients who underwent on-pump cardiac surgery. METHODS: One hundred one patients aged 65 yr or older who experienced subsyndromal delirium after on-pump cardiac surgery were randomized using a computer-generated list to receive 0.5 mg risperidone (n = 51) or placebo (n = 50) every 12 h by mouth. Patients were assessed at 8 h by a blinded observer using the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist, and those scoring more than 3 were evaluated by a blinded psychiatrist to confirm delirium. Patients in either group who experienced delirium were treated according to the same algorithm. Initially, risperidone was administered and if symptoms were not controlled, haloperidol was administered. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who experienced delirium in either group. RESULTS: Seven (13.7{\%}) patients in the risperidone group experienced delirium versus 17 (34{\%}) in the placebo group (P = 0.031) Competing-risks regression analysis showed that failure to treat subsyndromal delirium with risperidone was an independent risk factor for delirium (subhazard ratio, 3.83; 95{\%} CI, 1.63-8.98; P = 0.002). Two (3.9{\%}) patients in the risperidone group experienced extrapyramidal manifestations versus one (2{\%}) in the placebo group (P = 1.0). CONCLUSION: Administration of risperidone to elderly patients who experienced subsyndromal delirium after on-pump cardiac surgery was associated with significantly lower incidence of delirium. Larger studies are required to determine whether early administration of risperidone during the subsyndromal phase of delirium would influence the clinical course of such patients.},

@article{Hall2017,
	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: As the US population ages, the number of operations performed on elderly patients will likely increase. Frailty predicts postoperative mortality and morbidity more than age alone, thus presenting opportunities to identify the highest-risk surgical patients and improve their outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of the Frailty Screening Initiative (FSI) on mortality and complications by comparing the surgical outcomes of a cohort of surgical patients treated before and after implementation of the FSI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This single-site, facility-wide, prospective cohort quality improvement project studied all 9153 patients from a level 1b Veterans Affairs medical center who presented for major, elective, noncardiac surgery from October 1, 2007, to July 1, 2014. INTERVENTIONS: Assessment of preoperative frailty in all patients scheduled for elective surgery began in July 2011. Frailty was assessed with the Risk Analysis Index (RAI), and the records of all frail patients (RAI score, ≥21) were flagged for administrative review by the chief of surgery (or designee) before the scheduled operation. On the basis of this review, clinicians from surgery, anesthesia, critical care, and palliative care were notified of the patient's frailty and associated surgical risks; if indicated, perioperative plans were modified based on team input. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Postoperative mortality at 30, 180, and 365 days. RESULTS: From October 1, 2007, to July 1, 2014, a total of 9153 patients underwent surgery (mean {$[$}SD{$]$} age, 60.3 {$[$}13.5{$]$} years; female, 653 {$[$}7.1{\%}{$]$}; and white, 7096 {$[$}79.8{\%}{$]$}). Overall 30-day mortality decreased from 1.6{\%} (84 of 5275 patients) to 0.7{\%} (26 of 3878 patients, P < .001) after FSI implementation. Improvement was greatest among frail patients (12.2{\%} {$[$}24 of 197 patients{$]$} to 3.8{\%} {$[$}16 of 424 patients{$]$}, P < .001), although mortality rates also decreased among the robust patients (1.2{\%} {$[$}60 of 5078 patients{$]$} to 0.3{\%} {$[$}10 of 3454 patients{$]$}, P < .001). The magnitude of improvement among frail patients increased at 180 (23.9{\%} {$[$}47 of 197 patients{$]$} to 7.7{\%} {$[$}30 of 389 patients{$]$}, P < .001) and 365 days (34.5{\%} {$[$}68 of 197 patients{$]$} to 11.7{\%} {$[$}36 of 309 patients{$]$}, P < .001). Multivariable models revealed improved survival after FSI implementation, controlling for age, frailty, and predicted mortality (adjusted odds ratio for 180-day survival, 2.87; 95{\%} CI, 1.98-4.16). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Implementation of the FSI was associated with reduced mortality, suggesting the feasibility of widespread screening of patients preoperatively to identify frailty and the efficacy of system-level initiatives aimed at improving their surgical outcomes. Additional investigation is required to establish a causal connection.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The choice of anaesthetic technique for patients undergoing joint arthroplasty is debatable. The hypothesis of this study was that general anaesthesia would generate a more favourable recovery profile than spinal anaesthesia. METHODS: We randomly allocated 120 patients to either intrathecal bupivacaine or general anaesthesia with target-controlled infusion of remifentanil and propofol. Length of hospital stay assessed as meeting discharge criteria was the primary outcome parameter. Other outcome parameters were actual time of discharge, pain, use of rescue pain medication, blood loss, length of stay in the post-operative care unit, dizziness, post-operative nausea, need of urinary catheterisation and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: General anaesthesia resulted in slightly reduced length of hospital stay (26 vs. 30 h, P = 0.004), less nausea (P = 0.043) and dizziness (P < 0.001). General anaesthesia patients had higher pain scores during the first two post-operative hours (P < 0.001) but lower after 6 h compared with the spinal anaesthesia group (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05). General anaesthesia patients had better orthostatic function compared with spinal anaesthesia patients (P = 0.008). Patients in the spinal anaesthesia group fulfilled the discharge criteria from the post-operative care unit earlier compared with the general anaesthesia patients (P = 0.004). General anaesthesia patients requested a change in the method of anaesthesia for a subsequent operation less often than the spinal anaesthesia patients (5 vs. 13, P = 0.022). CONCLUSION: General anaesthesia resulted in a more favourable recovery profile compared with spinal anaesthesia.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study was undertaken to compare the effects of general anaesthesia (GA) and spinal anaesthesia (SA) on the need for postoperative hospitalization and early postoperative comfort in patients undergoing fast-track total knee arthroplasty (TKA). METHODS: One hundred and twenty subjects were randomly allocated to receive either intrathecal bupivacaine (SA group) or GA with target controlled infusion of propofol and remifentanil (GA group). Primary outcome was length of hospital stay (LOS) defined as time from end of surgery until the subject met the hospital discharge criteria. Secondary outcome parameters included actual time of discharge, postoperative pain, intraoperative blood loss, length of stay in the Post Anaesthesia Care Unit, dizziness, postoperative nausea and vomiting, need for urinary catheterization and subject satisfaction. RESULTS: GA resulted in shorter LOS (46 vs 52 h, P<0.001), and less nausea and vomiting (4 vs 15, P<0.05) and dizziness (VAS 0 mm vs 20 mm, P<0.05) compared with SA. During the first 2 postoperative hours, GA patients had higher pain scores (P<0.001), but after 6 h the SA group had significantly higher pain scores (P<0.001). Subjects in the GA group used fewer patient-controlled analgesia doses and less morphine (P<0.01), and were able to walk earlier compared with the SA group (P<0.001). Subjects receiving SA would request a change in the method of anaesthesia in the event of a subsequent operation more often than the GA subjects (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: GA had more favourable recovery effects after TKA compared with SA.},

	abstract = {Objective: To study the preventive effect of dexmedetomidine (DEX) on the postoperative delirium (POD) in elderly patients aged over 75 years old after vertebral fracture operation, and its regulating effect on the depth of anesthesia during operation. Methods: A total of 90 patients aged 75-90 years old with vertebral fractures surgically treated under general anesthesia in Nanxiang Hospital of Shanghai Jiading District from January 2015 to December 2017 were enrolled in this study. They were randomly divided into the DEX group (group A, n=30), the midazolam group (group B, n=30) and the control group (group C, n=30). Group A was injected with DEX (0.5 μg/kg) through a pump for 10 min before anesthesia induction, and then the drug was maintained at 0.4 μg/(kg·h) until the end of operation; group B received intravenous injection of 0.03 mg/kg midazolam; group C was given the same dose of normal saline. During operation, the bispectral index (BIS) was used to monitor the depth of anesthesia, which was maintained by adjusting the inspired concentration of sevoflurane (BIS value: 55-60). The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, extubation time, Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale at extubation, intraoperative sevoflurane dosage, statuses of postoperative nausea, vomiting, dizziness and other adverse reactions, and delirium assessment at 1-5 days after operation (confusion assessment method) were recorded and compared. Results: There were no significant differences in general condition, operation time, intraoperative blood loss and fracture site among the three groups of patients (all P>0.05). Extubation time in group B was longer than those in group A and C (P<0.05), and there was no significant difference in extubation time between group A and C (P>0.05). The agitation rates at extubation of patients in group B and C were significantly higher than that in group A (P<0.05). The intraoperative dosage of sevoflurane in group A was obviously less than those in group B and C (P<0.05). There were no significant differences in the incidence rate of postoperative adverse reactions among the three groups of patients (P>0.05). The incidence rate of POD in group A was apparently lower than those in group B and C (P<0.05); the incidence rate of POD at 1-2 days after operation in group B was higher than that in group C (P<0.05); there was no significant difference in the incidence rate of POD at 3-5 days after operation between group B and C (P>0.05). Conclusion: DEX not only had a good sedative effect, but also could be used in combination with sevoflurane to control the depth of anesthesia, reduce the dosage of sevoflurane, and lower the incidence rate of POD in elderly patients after vertebral fracture operation and the agitation rate at extubation under general anesthesia.},

@article{Heilmann2016,
	abstract = {AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate an intervention with individualised information and emotional support before coronary artery bypass grafting in a controlled randomised trial. BACKGROUND: Anxiety is a typical phenomenon in patients who are to undergo cardiac surgery. Preoperative anxiety has been shown to correlate to adverse postoperative outcomes. Emotional support could be an effective measure to reduce preoperative anxiety. DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with planned first coronary artery bypass grafting were randomised into an intervention group (n = 139) and a control group (n = 114). The patients of the control group were routinely informed as usual. The patients of the intervention group received a dialogue with individualised information and emotional support one day before surgery in addition to standard care. This intervention of \~{}30 minutes was based on a supportive psychotherapy model and was delivered by trained nurses. The primary outcome was the change in anxiety before operation. The secondary outcomes consisted of changes in postoperative anxiety, time on intensive care unit and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Significantly reduced anxiety was found in the intervention group patients compared to control patients before coronary artery bypass grafting (p < 0.001) and five days after surgery (p < 0.001). Both groups did not differ in in-hospital mortality and duration of stay in the intensive care unit. CONCLUSIONS: Our short-term psychosocial intervention in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting had a beneficial effect on reducing pre- and postoperative anxiety that was better than routine information alone. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: These results advocate training for nurses and physicians to provide emotional support to patients before coronary artery bypass grafting.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delirium is a serious and common postoperative complication, especially in frail elderly patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a geriatric liaison intervention in comparison with standard care on the incidence of postoperative delirium in frail elderly cancer patients treated with an elective surgical procedure for a solid tumour. METHODS: Patients over 65 years of age who were undergoing elective surgery for a solid tumour were recruited to a multicentre, prospective, randomized, controlled trial. The patients were randomized to standard treatment versus a geriatric liaison intervention. The intervention consisted of a preoperative geriatric consultation, an individual treatment plan targeted at risk factors for delirium, daily visits by a geriatric nurse during the hospital stay and advice on managing any problems encountered. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative delirium. The secondary outcome measures were the severity of delirium, length of hospital stay, complications, mortality, care dependency, quality of life, return to an independent preoperative living situation and additional care at home. RESULTS: In total, the data of 260 patients were analysed. Delirium occurred in 31 patients (11.9{\%}), and there was no significant difference between the incidence of delirium in the intervention group and the usual-care group (9.4{\%} vs. 14.3{\%}, OR: 0.63, 95{\%} CI: 0.29-1.35). CONCLUSIONS: Within this study, a geriatric liaison intervention based on frailty for the prevention of postoperative delirium in frail elderly cancer patients undergoing elective surgery for a solid tumour has not proven to be effective.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the long term effects after discharge of a hospital-based geriatric liaison intervention to prevent postoperative delirium in frail elderly cancer patients treated with an elective surgical procedure for a solid tumour. In addition, the effect of a postoperative delirium on long term outcomes was examined. METHODS: A three month follow-up was performed in participants of the Liaison Intervention in Frail Elderly study, a multicentre, prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Patients were randomized to standard treatment or a geriatric liaison intervention. The intervention consisted of a preoperative geriatric consultation, an individual treatment plan targeted at risk factors for delirium and daily visits by a geriatric nurse during the hospital stay. The long term outcomes included: mortality, rehospitalisation, Activities of Daily Living (ADL) functioning, return to the independent pre-operative living situation, use of supportive care, cognitive functioning and health related quality of life. RESULTS: Data of 260 patients (intervention n = 127, Control n = 133) were analysed. There were no differences between the intervention group and usual-care group for any of the outcomes three months after discharge. The presence of postoperative delirium was associated with: an increased risk of decline in ADL functioning (OR: 2.65, 95{\%} CI: 1.02-6.88), an increased use of supportive assistance (OR: 2.45, 95{\%} CI: 1.02-5.87) and a decreased chance to return to the independent preoperative living situation (OR: 0.18, 95{\%} CI: 0.07-0.49). CONCLUSIONS: A hospital-based geriatric liaison intervention for the prevention of postoperative delirium in frail elderly cancer patients undergoing elective surgery for a solid tumour did not improve outcomes 3 months after discharge from hospital. The negative effect of a postoperative delirium on late outcome was confirmed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Nederlands Trial Register, Trial ID NTR 823.},

	abstract = {General or regional anaesthesia can be used for chronic subdural haematoma evacuation, but no study has compared these types of anaesthesia in terms of peri-operative outcomes. This single-centre, prospective, randomised study included adult patients (age >/= 18 years) undergoing surgical chronic subdural haematoma evacuation. Patients were randomly allocated to general (target-controlled total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol and remifentanil) or regional anaesthesia (bilateral scalp block with remifentanil sedation if required). The primary outcome measure was duration of hospital stay, based on the day patients were judged by an investigator blinded from the allocation group to be medically fit for discharge. Secondary outcomes included: rate of regional anaesthesia failure; rate of intra-operative and postoperative adverse events at 24 hours; and pain scores at 24 hours. Data from 60 patients were analysed (30 general anaesthesia and 30 regional anaesthesia). Median (IQR {$[$}range{$]$}) time until patients were judged medically fit for discharge was 3 (3-3 {$[$}2-10{$]$}) days and 3 (2-5 {$[$}2-15{$]$}) days for general and regional anaesthesia, respectively (p = 0.700). Regional anaesthesia failed in two patients. There were more intra-operative adverse events in patients who received general anaesthesia (25 vs. 11, respectively; p = 0.001). The occurrence of postoperative adverse events was similar for general and regional anaesthesia (16 vs. 13 patients, respectively; p = 0.605). In patients requiring chronic subdural haematoma evacuation, general and regional anaesthesia are comparable in terms of duration of time until medically fit for discharge and occurrence of postoperative complications. The rate of intra-operative adverse events (mainly arterial hypotension) is greater with general anaesthesia.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium was reported to be associated with increased postoperative mortality after liver resection. Therefore, it is crucial to prevent postoperative delirium in such cases. Ramelteon, an agonist of melatonin receptor has been suggested to be useful for preventing delirium. The aim of this study was to examine whether ramelteon is effective at preventing delirium after elective liver resection. METHODS: The cases of patients who underwent liver resection at Nara Medical University (Nara, Japan) between January 2014 and August 2018 were analyzed. During the period from January 2017 to August 2018, ramelteon was prospectively administered to patients who underwent liver resection {$[$}8 mg/day on the day before surgery and on postoperative days 1 to 3{$]$} (ramelteon group), whereas ramelteon was not administered during the period from January 2014 to December 2016 (control group). The perioperative outcomes of the two groups were compared. RESULTS: There were 120 patients in the ramelteon group and 186 patients in the control group. No significant intergroup differences in background factors, including age, gender, and preoperative serological laboratory data, were detected. The incidence of postoperative delirium was significantly lower in the ramelteon group (5.8{\%} vs. 15.1{\%}, P = 0.035). Multivariate analysis revealed that being aged ≥75 (P = 0.002), being male (P = 0.020), cardiovascular disease (P = 0.023), blood loss ≥1000ml (P = 0.001) and the absence of ramelteon treatment (P = 0.046) were independent risk factors for postoperative delirium. CONCLUSION: The administration of ramelteon might reduce the risk of postoperative delirium after elective liver resection.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: Delirium is frequently observed in the postoperative and intensive care unit (ICU) population. Due to the multifactorial origin of delirium and according to international guidelines (e.g., American Geriatrics Society; Prevention and Management of Pain, Agitation/Sedation, Delirium, Immobility, and Sleep Disruption (PADIS) guideline), there are several but no incontestable options for prevention and symptomatic treatment. The purpose of the Baden PRIDe (Prevention and Reduction of Incidence of postoperative Delirium) trial was to determine whether postoperative cognitive dysfunction and delirium could be prevented by the combination of possible preventive agents such as haloperidol and ketamine. In addition, pre- and postoperative levels of the biomarkers cortisol, neuron specific enolase (NSE) and S100βwere measured to investigate their dynamics in delirious and non-delirious patients after surgery. DESIGN: The Baden PRIDe Trial was an investigator-initiated, phase IV, two-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial. SETTING: Perioperative care. PATIENTS: 182 adult patients that underwent elective or emergency surgery under general or combined (i.e., general and regional) anaesthesia. INTERVENTIONS: Pre-anaesthetic, pharmacologic prevention of postoperative brain dysfunction with haloperidol, ketamine, and the combination of both vs. placebo. MEASUREMENTS: Assessment of cognitive performance pre- and postoperatively with the MMSE, the DOS, the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (Nu-DESC) or the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) during ICU stay. MAIN RESULTS: None of the three study arms - haloperidol, ketamine, or both drugs combined - was significantly superior to placebo for prevention of postoperative brain dysfunction and delirium (P = 0.39). Measured levels of postoperative cortisol were significantly higher in delirious patients. S-100βlevels were significantly higher in all postoperative outcome groups (cognitive impairment, delirium, no cognitive decline), whereas postoperative NSE levels declined in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: The study results offer no possibility for a novel recommendation for prevention of postoperative cognitive decline including delirium. Perioperative S-100βtrajectories in patients with cognitive deterioration suggest affection of glial cells in particular.

	abstract = {Delirium occurs in up to 65{\%} of older hip fracture patients. Developing delirium in hospital has been associated with a variety of adverse outcomes. Trials have shown that multi-component preventive interventions can lower delirium rates. The objective of this study was to implement and evaluate the effectiveness of an evidence-based electronic care pathway, which incorporates multi-component delirium strategies, among older hip fracture patients. We conducted a pragmatic study using an interrupted time series design in order to evaluate the use and impact of the intervention. The target population was all consenting patients aged 65 years or older admitted with an acute hip fracture to the orthopedic units at two Calgary, Alberta hospitals. The primary outcome was delirium rates. Secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay, in-hospital falls, in-hospital mortality, new discharges to long-term care, and readmissions. A Durbin Watson test was conducted to test for serial correlation and, because no correlation was found, Chi-square statistics, Wilcoxon test and logistic regression analyses were conducted as appropriate. At study completion, focus groups were conducted at each hospital to explore issues around the use of the order set. During the 40-week study period, 134 patients were enrolled. The intervention had no effect on the overall delirium rate (33{\%} pre versus 31{\%} post; p = 0.84). However, there was a significant interaction between study phase and hospital (p = 0.03). Although one hospital did not experience a decline in delirium rate, the delirium rate at the other hospital declined from 42{\%} to 19{\%} (p = 0.08). This difference by hospital was mirrored in focus group feedback. The hospital that experienced a decline in delirium rates was more supportive of the intervention. Overall, post-intervention there were no significant differences in mean length of stay (12 days post versus 14 days pre; p = 0.74), falls (6{\%} post versus 10{\%} pre; p = 0.43) or discharges to long-term care (6{\%} post versus 13{\%} pre; p = 0.20). Translation of evidence-based multi-component delirium prevention strategies into everyday clinical care, using the electronic medical record, was not found to be effective at decreasing delirium rates among hip facture patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dexmedetomidine promotes normal sleep architecture; the drug also improves analgesia. We therefore tested the hypothesis that supplementing intravenous analgesia with dexmedetomidine reduces delirium in older patients recovering from orthopedic surgery. METHODS: In this double-blinded randomized controlled trial, we enrolled 712 older (aged 65-90 years) patients scheduled for major orthopedic surgery. Postoperative analgesia was provided by patient-controlled intravenous sufentanil, supplemented by randomly assigned dexmedetomidine (1.25 μg/mL) or placebo, for up to three days. The primary outcome was the incidence of delirium assessed twice daily with the Confusion Assessment Method. Among secondary outcomes, pain severity was assessed twice daily and sleep quality once daily, each with an 11-point scale where 0 = no pain/the best possible sleep and 10 = the worst pain/the worst possible sleep. RESULTS: The incidence of postoperative delirium was 7.3{\%} (26 of 354) with placebo and 4.8{\%} (17 of 356) with dexmedetomidine; relative risk 0.65, 95{\%} CI 0.36 to 1.18; P = 0.151. Dexmedetomidine reduced pain both at rest (median difference -1 to 0 points, P ≤0.001) and with movement (-1 points, P < 0.001) throughout the first 5 postoperative days; it also improved subjective sleep quality during the first 3 postoperative days: day one median difference -1 point (95{\%} CI -1 to 0), P = 0.007; day two 0 point (-1 to 0), P = 0.010; and day three 0 point (-1 to 0), P = 0.003. The incidence of adverse events was similar in each group. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementing sufentanil intravenous analgesia with low-dose dexmedetomidine did not significantly reduce delirium, but improved analgesia and sleep quality without provoking adverse events.

	abstract = {There are many drugs that affect postoperative cognitive function in patients under general anesthesia. Pentanethaquine hydrochloride (PHC), as a new type of anti-cholinergic drug, has been widely used. In clinical practice, many patients, especially elderly patients, have suffered from obvious postoperative cognitive dysfunction, but the incidence of pulmonary infection, reduced probably due to the decease of secretion production. Therefore, the effect of PHC on postoperative cognitive functions and inflammatory factors in elderly lung cancer patients under general anesthesia were mainly discussed to determine the clinical advantages and disadvantages. Ninety elderly patients undergoing thoracoscopic surgery for lung cancer under general anesthesia were selected and divided into PHC group (group A, n = 30), atropine group (group B, n = 30) and normal saline control group (group C, n = 30). The incidence of postoperative blurred vision was higher in group A compared to group B and C (both p < 0.05). The incidence of other adverse reactions was higher in group A compared to group C (all p < 0.05), but there was no difference between group A and group B (all p > 0.05). There was no significant difference in preoperative and day 1 post-surgery mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores among the three groups (both p > 0.05), but the day 1 post-surgery MMSE scores of three groups were lower (all p < 0.05). PHC increased the incidence of postoperative cognitive impairment and postoperative delirium in elderly lung cancer patients undergoing thoracoscopic surgery under general anesthesia, but reduced the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications possibly by reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines.},

@article{Hu2021,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dexmedetomidine is known to be a sedative. Recent studies suggest that administration of dexmedetomidine can prevent postoperative delirium (POD) which has been confirmed as a common complication after major surgery. However, its effects in patients undergoing oesophagectomy are scarce. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine in reducing POD in elderly patients after transthoracic oesophagectomy with total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA). DESIGN: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Single-centre, tertiary care hospital, November 2016 to September 2018. PATIENTS: Eligible patients (n = 177) undergoing transthoracic oesophagectomy were randomly assigned to receive total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA, n = 87) or dexmedetomidine with TIVA (DEX-TIVA, n = 90). INTERVENTIONS: Patients receiving DEX-TIVA received a loading dose of dexmedetomidine (0.4 μg kg-1), over 15 min, followed by a continuous infusion at a rate of 0.1 μg kg-1 h-1 until 1 h before the end of surgery. Patients receiving TIVA received physiological saline with a similar infusion rate protocol. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the incidence of POD. The secondary endpoints were the incidence of emergence agitation, serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels and haemodynamic profile. RESULTS: All randomised patients were included with planned intention-to-treat analyses for POD. Delirium occurred in 15 (16.7{\%}) of 90 cases given dexmedetomidine, and in 32 (36.8{\%}) of 87 cases given saline (P = 0.0036). The DEX-TIVA group showed less frequent emergence agitation than the TIVA group (22.1 vs. 48.0{\%}, P = 0.0058). The incremental change in surgery-induced IL-6 levels was greater in the TIVA group than DEX-TIVA group (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Adding peri-operative dexmedetomidine to a total intravenous anaesthetic safely reduces POD and emergence agitation in elderly patients undergoing open transthoracic oesophagectomy. These benefits were associated with a postoperative reduction in circulating levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and stabilisation of the haemodynamic profile.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) commonly occurs after cardiac surgery. Ketamine exerts neuroprotective effects after cerebral ischemia by anti-excitotoxic and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. We hypothesized that ketamine attenuates POCD in patients undergoing cardiac surgery concomitant with an anti-inflammatory effect. METHODS: Patients randomly received placebo (0.9{\%} saline; n=26) or an i.v. bolus of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg; n=26) during anesthetic induction. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane and fentanyl. A nonsurgical group (n=26) was also included as control. Recent verbal and nonverbal memory and executive functions were assessed before and 1 week after surgery or a 1-week waiting period for the nonsurgical controls. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations were determined before surgery and on the first post-operative day. RESULTS: Baseline neurocognitive and depression scores were similar in the placebo, ketamine, and nonsurgical control groups. Cognitive performance after surgery decreased by at least 2 SDs (z-score of 1.96) in 21 patients in the placebo group and only in seven patients in the ketamine group compared with the nonsurgical controls (P<0.001, Fisher's exact test). Cognitive performance was also significantly different between the placebo- and the ketamine-treated groups based on all z-scores (P<0.001, Mann-Whitney U-test). Pre-operative CRP concentrations were similar (P<0.33, Mann-Whitney U-test) in the placebo- and ketamine-treated groups. The post-operative CRP concentration was significantly (P<0.01, Mann-Whitney U-test) lower in the ketamine-treated than in the placebo-treated group. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine attenuates POCD 1 week after cardiac surgery and this effect may be related to the anti-inflammatory action of the drug.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine if ketamine attenuates postoperative delirium concomitant with an anti-inflammatory effect in patients undergoing cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass. DESIGN: A prospective randomized study. SETTING: A Veterans Affairs medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Cardiac surgical patients. INTERVENTIONS: Patients at least 55 years of age randomly received placebo (0.9{\%} saline, n = 29) or an intravenous bolus of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg intravenously, n = 29) during anesthetic induction in the presence of fentanyl and etomidate. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Delirium was assessed by using the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist before and after surgery. Serum C-reactive protein concentrations were determined before and 1 day after surgery. The incidence of postoperative delirium was lower (p = 0.01, Fisher exact test) in patients receiving ketamine (3{\%}) compared with placebo (31{\%}). Postoperative C-reactive protein concentration was also lower (p < 0.05) in the ketamine-treated patients compared with the placebo-treated patients. The odds of developing postoperative delirium were greater for patients receiving placebo compared with ketamine treatment (odds ratio = 12.6; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.5-107.5; logistic regression).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delirium, which is one of the most disturbing postoperative complications in elderly patients, shows high morbidity in patients undergoing lung cancer surgery. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is considered a potential prophylactic agent for preventing patients' delirium after lung cancer surgery. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Medical records of lung cancer patients over 65 years old with radical pulmonary resection at Henan Provincial People's Hospital from January 2015 to December 2017, China, were evaluated. Patients, care-providers, and investigators were all blinded to group assignment. DEX was administered in the preoperative and intraoperative periods. The incidence of delirium was calculated based on the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC). Scores of ≥4 and 1-3 points represent the diagnoses of delirium and a pre-delirious state, respectively. RESULTS: During postoperative day 1 (POD 1) to POD 7, delirium occurs in both groups. During postoperative POD 1 to POD 7, the incidence of delirium is lower in the DEX group than that in the control group. Furthermore, there are more mild delirium patients but fewer moderate and severe delirium patients in the DEX group compared with the control group. Finally, patients in the DEX group have a shorter duration of delirium, lower numeric pain rating scale during movement and better sleep quality. CONCLUSION: Preoperative and intraoperative application of DEX can reduce the incidence and intensity of delirium after pulmonary resection in elderly patients with lung cancer.},

@article{Indrakusuma2015,
	abstract = {AIMS: Elderly patients with colorectal carcinoma are screened with the Identification of Seniors at Risk (ISAR) questionnaire to identify frail patients. These patients are more at risk for mortality and morbidity and are referred to the geriatric specialist for assessment (Dutch acronym: DOG). The DOG assessment aims to preoperatively optimize the patient in order to improve postoperative outcomes. This study evaluates if the DOG assessment influences postoperative outcome after colorectal surgery. METHODS: Retrospective cohort and match-control study. Elderly patients who underwent elective resection between 01-01-2008 and 01-08-2013 in the Medical Centre Alkmaar were included. Patients with a positive ISAR score were referred to the geriatric specialists for DOG assessment (DOG patients). DOG assessment encompassed comprehensive geriatric assessment and interventions. PRIMARY OUTCOMES: Mortality, delirium and length of hospital stay. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: postoperative complications. COHORT COMPARISON: Cohort ISAR- (2008-2010, no ISAR questionnaire) is compared with cohort ISAR+ (2011-2013, ISAR questionnaire). Match-control comparison: DOG patients are compared with matched controls from cohort ISAR-. RESULTS: Compared to their matched controls, DOG patients were older and had a higher prevalence of certain risk factors for postoperative delirium. In both comparisons, no statistical significant differences were found between the groups in mortality and postoperative delirium. Length of stay was significantly shorter in cohort ISAR+. CONCLUSIONS: While the DOG patients were significantly more at risk for postoperative complications, the DOG patients had comparable postoperative outcomes as their matched controls. We therefore conclude that the DOG assessment has a positive influence on the postoperative outcomes after colorectal surgery.},

DESIGN: Parallel-arm, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Academic medical center in La Jolla, California. PATIENTS: Patients greater than or equal to 18 years undergoing elective pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. INTERVENTIONS: Ramelteon 8 mg or matching placebo starting the night prior to surgery and for a maximum of six nights while in the ICU.

@article{Jakobsen2007,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the possible cardioprotective effect of sevoflurane versus propofol anesthesia in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. METHODS: Ten thousand five hundred thirty-five consecutive single cardiac surgical procedures from 3 cardiac centers were reported to a common registry from 1999 to 2005. The registry was established by the National Board of Health, and reporting was obligatory for all public heart centers in Denmark. The patients were stratified according to preoperative risk factors (EuroSCORE parameters). The outcome parameters were 30-day mortality, the incidence of postoperative myocardial infarction, and the incidence of postoperative arrhythmias. RESULTS: Overall, the 30-day mortality was lower after sevoflurane (2.84{\%}) versus propofol (3.30{\%}), although not significantly so (p = 0.18). No difference was found in the incidence of postoperative myocardial infarction (sevoflurane, 7.76{\%}/propofol, 7.47{\%}). Patients with preoperative unstable angina and/or recent myocardial infarction, and thus already "preconditioned," did not show any difference in mortality between anesthetic groups, whereas patients without these predictors showed a lower postoperative mortality after sevoflurane (2.28{\%} v 3.14{\%}, p = 0.015), which can at least partly be explained by a preconditioning-like effect. The data suggest that patients suffering relatively severe preoperative ischemic stress benefited from propofol anesthesia, which can be related to the antioxidant effects of propofol. Patients in the sevoflurane group had a higher incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation (28.75{\%} v 24.87{\%}, p < 0.001), whereas patients in the propofol group showed a higher incidence of all other arrhythmias. CONCLUSION: Sevoflurane and propofol both possess some, although different, cardioprotective properties. Sevoflurane appears to be superior to propofol in patients with little or no ischemic heart disease, such as noncoronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and CABG surgery without severe preoperative ischemia, whereas propofol seems superior in patients with severe ischemia, cardiovascular instability, or in acute/urgent surgery.},

	abstract = {Background: Patients undergoing cardiac surgery are particularly prone to delirium. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of melatonin administration on the inhibition of postoperative delirium in patients undergoing open-heart surgery. Methods: This study was conducted as a double-blind randomized clinical trial in Golestan Hospital. Ahvaz, Iran, (September 2018 to March 2019). Sixty patients undergoing elective on-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery were enrolled in the study, and they were randomly divided into a group receiving 3 mg of melatonin and a group receiving a placebo. The main outcomes were delirium occurrence and delirium intensity up to 48 hours after extubation. The data were analyzed using SPSS, version 22, (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Group comparisons were performed using the t test and the Chi-square test. Statistical significance was defined as a P value of less than 0.05. Results: On the first postoperative day, delirium developed in four (13.3{\%}) patients in the melatonin group and 11 (36.6{\%}) patients in the control group; the difference between the groups was statistically significant (P=0.037). On the second postoperative day, delirium developed in three (10{\%}) patients in the melatonin group and 14 (46.6{\%}) patients in the control group, with the difference in the incidence of delirium between the groups constituting statistical significance (P=0.029). The severity of delirium between group was significant on the first and second postoperative days (P=0.003). Conclusion: Melatonin may be effective in reducing the severity of delirium after cardiac surgery. The effect of melatonin as a delirium prevention agent should be considered in patients admitted in the cardiovascular intensive care. Trial Registration Number IRCT20180909040979N3.},

	abstract = {This study compares remifentanil/propofol (remi/prop) with isoflurane/fentanyl (iso/fen) anesthesia to determine which provides the greater hemodynamic stability, lesser myocardial ischemia, and morbidity with better postoperative outcomes after carotid endarterectomy. Sixty patients undergoing unilateral carotid endarterectomy were randomized to receive either a remi/prop or iso/fen anesthetic. Hemodynamic variables were recorded during the surgical procedure. In addition, transesophageal echocardiography was used to assess evidence of intraoperative regional wall motion abnormalities suggestive of cardiac ischemia. Emergence and extubation times, recovery from anesthesia, hemodynamic instability, nausea, vomiting, and pain in post anesthesia recovery, discharge delays, ICU admittance, hospital discharge, and preoperative and postoperative troponin levels were compared using appropriate statistical methods with P < 0.05 considered significant. The groups were demographically alike. Hemodynamic variables were similar during intubation and throughout surgery. Twenty-two percent of patients receiving iso/fen developed intraoperative regional wall motion abnormalities suggestive of ischemia, whereas no remi/prop patients had changes (P < 0.05). There was no difference in ST-T wave changes after surgery, and no patient had an elevation in troponin I levels. Postoperative variables were similar except that patients who received iso/fen had lower Stewart recovery scores during the first 15 minutes after post anesthesia care unit admission and a higher incidence of nausea and vomiting the day after surgery, whereas patients receiving remi/prop had discharge delays secondary to hypertension. ICU admittance, time to first void, oral intake, and time to hospital discharge were similar between the groups. At 9 times the cost of an iso/fen anesthesia technique, remi/prop offers little advantage over inhalational anesthesia for carotid endarterectomy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Older patients undergoing surgery tend to have a higher frequency of delirium. Delirium is strongly associated with poor surgical outcomes. This study evaluated the association between pre-operative medication use and post-operative delirium (POD) in surgical oncology patients receiving comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA). METHODS: A total of 475 patients who were scheduled for cancer surgery and received CGA from January 2014 to June 2015 were included. Pre-operative medication review through CGA was conducted on polypharmacy (≥5 medications), delirium-inducing medications (DIMs), fall-inducing medications (FIMs), and potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs). POD was confirmed by psychiatric consultation, and DSM-V criteria were used for diagnosing delirium. The model fit of the prediction model was assessed by computing the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. Effect size was measured using the Nagelkerke R(2). Discrimination of the model was assessed by an analysis of the area under receiver operating curve (AUROC). RESULTS: Two models were constructed for multivariate analysis based on univariate analysis; model I included dementia and DIM in addition to age and sex, and model II included PIM instead of DIM of model I. Every one year increase of age increased the risk of POD by about 1.1-fold. DIM was a significant factor for POD after adjusting for confounders (AOR 12.78, 95 {\%} CI 2.83-57.74). PIM was also a significant factor for POD (AOR 5.53, 95 {\%} CI 2.03-15.05). The Hosmer-Lemeshow test results revealed good fits for both models (χ(2) = 3.842, p = 0.871 for model I and χ(2) = 8.130, p = 0.421 for model II). The Nagelkerke R(2) effect size and AUROC for model I was 0.215 and 0.833, respectively. Model II had the Nagelkerke R(2)effect size of 0.174 and AUROC of 0.819. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that pharmacists' comprehensive review for pre-operative medication use is critical for the post-operative outcomes like delirium in older patients.},

@article{Jia2014,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the role of fast-track surgery in preventing the development of postoperative delirium and other complications in elderly patients with colorectal carcinoma. METHODS: A total of 240 elderly patients with colorectal carcinoma (aged ≥70 years) undergoing open colorectal surgery was randomly assigned into two groups, in which the patients were managed perioperatively either with traditional or fast-track approaches. The length of hospital stay (LOS) and time to pass flatus were compared. The incidence of postoperative delirium and other complications were evaluated. Serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were determined before and after surgery. RESULTS: The LOS was significantly shorter in the fast-track surgery (FTS) group than that in the traditional group. The recovery of bowel movement (as indicated by the time to pass flatus) was faster in the FTS group. The postoperative complications including pulmonary infection, urinary infection and heart failure were significantly less frequent in the FTS group. Notably, the incidence of postoperative delirium was significantly lower in patients with the fast track therapy (4/117, 3.4 {\%}) than with the traditional therapy (15/116, 12.9 {\%}; p = 0.008). The serum IL-6 levels on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3 in patients with the fast-track therapy were significantly lower than those with the traditional therapy (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to traditional perioperative management, fast-track surgery decreases the LOS, facilitates the recovery of bowel movement, and reduces occurrence of postoperative delirium and other complications in elderly patients with colorectal carcinoma. The lower incidence of delirium is at least partly attributable to the reduced systemic inflammatory response mediated by IL-6.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES/BACKGROUND: The Geriatric Surgery Verification (GSV) Program promotes clinical standards aimed to optimize the quality of surgical care delivered to older adults. The purpose of this study was to determine if preliminary implementation of the GSV Program standards improves surgical outcomes. DESIGN: Prospective study with cohort matching. SETTING: Data from a single institution compared with a national data set cohort. PARTICIPANTS: All patients aged ≥75 years undergoing inpatient operations between January 2018 and December 2019 were included. Cohort matching by age and procedure code was performed using a national data set. MEASUREMENTS: Baseline pre- and intraoperative characteristics prospectively recorded using Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP) variable definitions. Postoperative outcomes were recorded including complications as defined by VASQIP, 30-day mortality, and length of stay. RESULTS: A total of 162 patients participated in the GSV program, and 308 patients comprised the matched comparison group. There was no difference in postoperative occurrence of one or more complications (p = 0.81) or 30-day mortality (p = 0.61). Patients cared for by the GSV Program had a reduced postoperative length of stay (median 4 days {$[$}range 1,31{$]$} vs. 5 days {$[$}range 1,86{$]$}; p < 0.01; and mean 5.4 $\pm$4.8 vs. 8.8 $\pm$11.8 days; p < 0.01) compared with the matched cohort. In a multivariable regression model, the GSV Program's reduced length of stay was independent of other associated covariates including age, operative time, and comorbidities (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Preliminary implementation of the GSV Program standards reduces length of stay in older adults undergoing inpatient operations. This finding demonstrates both the clinical and financial value of the GSV Program.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To study the effectiveness of haloperidol prophylaxis on incidence, severity, and duration of postoperative delirium in elderly hip-surgery patients at risk for delirium. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Large medical school-affiliated general hospital in Alkmaar, The Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 430 hip-surgery patients aged 70 and older at risk for postoperative delirium. INTERVENTION: Haloperidol 1.5 mg/d or placebo was started preoperatively and continued for up to 3 days postoperatively. Proactive geriatric consultation was provided for all randomized patients. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative delirium (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, and Confusion Assessment Method criteria). Secondary outcomes were the severity of delirium (Delirium Rating Scale, revised version-98 (DRS-R-98)), the duration of delirium, and the length of hospital stay. RESULTS: The overall incidence of postoperative delirium was 15.8{\%}. The percentage of patients with postoperative delirium in the haloperidol and placebo treatment condition was 15.1{\%} and 16.5{\%}, respectively (relative risk=0.91, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI)=0.6-1.3); the mean highest DRS-R-98 score+/-standard deviation was 14.4+/-3.4 and 18.4+/-4.3, respectively (mean difference 4.0, 95{\%} CI=2.0-5.8; P<.001); delirium duration was 5.4 versus 11.8 days, respectively (mean difference 6.4 days, 95{\%} CI=4.0-8.0; P<.001); and the mean number of days in the hospital was 17.1+/-11.1 and 22.6+/-16.7, respectively (mean difference 5.5 days, 95{\%} CI=1.4-2.3; P<.001). No haloperidol-related side effects were noted. CONCLUSION: Low-dose haloperidol prophylactic treatment demonstrated no efficacy in reducing the incidence of postoperative delirium. It did have a positive effect on the severity and duration of delirium. Moreover, haloperidol reduced the number of days patients stayed in the hospital, and the therapy was well tolerated.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To evaluate the influence of anesthetic technique on perioperative neurological and cardiopulmonary complication rates in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 186 patients with symptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis > 70{\%} or asymptomatic ICA stenosis > 80{\%} were prospectively randomized for either locoregional (LA) or general anesthesia (GA). RESULTS: Neurological complication rates were similar in both groups (GA 2{\%} vs. LA 2{\%}). Cardiopulmonary complication rates were not significantly different (GA 4{\%} vs LA 1{\%}). There were no stroke-related deaths, but one patient from the GA group died from severe postoperative pneumonia. Thus, a significant difference in combined stroke/cardiopulmonary related death between the two groups (GA 1{\%} vs LA 0{\%}) could not be found. However, perioperative cardiopulmonary monitoring showed that significantly more patients operated under general anesthesia had hypertensive events, with systolic blood pressure values greater than 180 mmHg on postoperative day one. There were no differences in the number of postoperatively hypotensive episodes (systolic blood pressure values < 100 mmHg) between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences in the perioperative neurological and cardiopulmonary complication rates between general and locoregional anesthesia in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy could not be observed.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Periprosthetic joint infection is a serious complication of total knee arthroplasty. Though there are many factors that might increase its risk, the use of propofol for maintaining general anesthesia could theoretically increase the incidence of infection because of its lipid component that supports bacterial growth. Nevertheless, the relationship between anesthetic maintenance agents and the occurrence of periprosthetic joint infection remains uncertain. The purpose of this study was to compare the incidence of suspected early-onset periprosthetic joint infection between patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty under propofol vs sevoflurane anesthesia. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients in the national inpatient Diagnosis Procedure Combination database in Japan who underwent total knee arthroplasty. Suspected periprosthetic joint infection was surrogately defined as the need for arthrocentesis or debridement within 30 days of surgery. Propensity score matching was performed between patients who received either propofol or sevoflurane for anesthetic maintenance to determine the proportion of those with infection. RESULTS: Eligible patients (n = 21,899) were categorized into either the propofol (n = 7,439) or sevoflurane (n = 14,460) groups. In the 5,140 propensity-matched patient pairs, there was no significant difference in the proportion of arthrocentesis or debridement {$[$}1.3{\%} propofol vs 1.7{\%} sevoflurane; respectively (relative risk, 0.76; 95{\%} CI, 0.55 to 1.04; P = 0.10){$]$} between the groups. The mean (SD) length of stay in the propofol group was significantly longer than in the sevoflurane group {$[$}32.5 (18.4) days vs 31.4 (14.4) days, respectively; mean difference, 1.1; 95{\%} CI, 0.5 to 1.8; P < 0.001{$]$}. CONCLUSION: Propensity score analysis suggested no significant association between the choice of anesthetic maintenance agent and the occurrence of suspected early-onset periprosthetic joint infection in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.},

	abstract = {It is unknown if the type of general anaesthetic used for maintenance of anaesthesia affects the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of POCD in patients administered either sevoflurane or propofol for maintenance of anaesthesia during total hip replacement surgery. Following administration of a spinal anaesthetic, patients received either sevoflurane (n=121) or propofol (n=171) at the discretion of the anaesthetist for maintenance of general anaesthesia to maintain the processed electroencephalogram (bispectral index, BIS) under 60. POCD was assessed postoperatively at day 7, three months, and 12 months using a neurocognitive test battery. There was no statistically significant difference between the incidence of POCD at any timepoint with sevoflurane compared to propofol. The mean BIS was significantly lower in the sevoflurane group than in the propofol group (mean BIS 44.3 {$[$}standard deviation, SD 7.5{$]$} in the sevoflurane group versus 53.7 {$[$}SD 8.1{$]$} in the propofol group, <i>P</i>=0.0001). However, there was no statistically significant association between intraoperative BIS level and the incidence of POCD at any timepoint. Our results suggest that the incidence of POCD is not strongly influenced by the type of anaesthesia used in elderly patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anesthetic agents used for general anesthesia are emerging possible influential factors for surgical site infection (SSI). In this retrospective study, we evaluated the incidence of SSI after colorectal surgery according to the main anesthetic agents: volatile anesthetics vs. propofol. METHODS: A total 1,934 adult patients, who underwent elective colorectal surgery under general anesthesia between January 2011 and December 2013, were surveyed to evaluate the incidence of SSI: 1,519 using volatile anesthetics and 415 using propofol for main anesthetic agents. Patient, surgery, and anesthesia-related factors were investigated from all patients. Propensity-score matching was performed to reduce the risk of confounding and produced 390 patients in each group. RESULTS: Within the propensity-score matched groups, the incidence of SSI was higher in the volatile group compared with the propofol group (10 {$[$}2.6{\%}{$]$} vs. 2 {$[$}0.5{\%}{$]$}, OR = 5.0 {$[$}95{\%} CI = 1.1-2.8{$]$}). C-reactive protein was higher in the volatile group than in the propofol group (8.4 +/- 5.6 vs. 7.1 +/- 5.3 mg/dl, P = 0.001), and postoperative white blood cells count was higher in the volatile group than in the propofol group (9.2 +/- 3.2 x 10(3)/microl vs. 8.6 +/- 3.4 x 10(3)/microl, P = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that intravenous anesthesia may have beneficial effects for reducing SSI in colorectal surgery compared to volatile anesthesia.},

@article{Kratz2015,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common complication in elderly hospitalized patients. It prolongs the length of hospital stay, raises costs, increases the workload of the nursing staff, and may necessitate transfer of the patient to a nursing home. The risk of postoperative delirium is particularly high in elderly patients with pre-existing cognitive deficits. METHODS: In an open study, we systematically assessed the frequency of postoperative delirium in patients over age 70 on two surgical wards of a general hospital. In a six-month "prevalence phase," from March to August 2011, we counted the number of patients with postoperative delirium, but did not initiate any intervention. Thereafter, in a ten-month "intervention phase" from September 2011 to June 2012, a nurse with special training in the management of delirium carried out an intervention involving component measures of the Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP) on one of the two wards, with the aim of preventing postoperative delirium. The patients on the other ward served as a control group. RESULTS: In the prevalence phase, 20.2{\%} of all patients developed postoperative delirium (95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$}, 14.6-26.4). In the intervention phase, postoperative delirium arose in 20.8{\%} (95{\%} CI, 11.3-32.1) of the patients on the ward with no specific interventions, but in only 4.9{\%} (95{\%} CI, 0.0-11.5) of those on the ward where the intervention was carried out. The difference was presumably due to the measures initiated by the specially trained nurse, including validation, improvement of sleep, cognitive activation, early mobilization, improved sensory stimulation, and improved nutritional and fluid intake. Important predictors of postoperative delirium included a low score on the Mini-Mental State Examination, advanced age, and preoperative infection. CONCLUSION: The frequency of postoperative delirium in elderly patients with cognitive deficits can be lowered with nursing measures carried out by a specially trained nurse, close postoperative supervision, and cognitive activation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delirium is a serious postoperative condition for which few pharmacologic prevention trials have been conducted. OBJECTIVE: The authors tested the efficacy of perioperative olanzapine administration to prevent postoperative delirium in elderly patients after joint-replacement surgery. METHOD: The authors conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prophylaxis trial at an orthopedic teaching hospital, enrolling 495 elderly patients age >/=65 years, who were undergoing elective knee- or hip-replacement surgery; 400 patients received either 5 mg of orally-disintegrating olanzapine or placebo just before and after surgery. The primary efficacy outcome was the incidence of (DSM-III-R) delirium. RESULTS: The incidence of delirium was significantly lower in the olanzapine group than in the placebo group; this held true for both knee- and hip-replacement surgery. However, delirium lasted longer and was more severe in the olanzapine group. Advanced age, a high level of medical comorbidity, an abnormal albumin level, and having knee-replacement surgery were independent risk factors for postoperative delirium (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT000699946). CONCLUSION: Administration of 10 mg of oral olanzapine perioperatively, versus placebo, was associated with a significantly lower incidence of delirium. These findings suggest that olanzapine prophylaxis of postoperative delirium may be an effective strategy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A geriatric hip fracture clinical pathway, led by an orthopedic surgeon, was developed in 2007. This clinical pathway team is multidisciplinary and consists of surgeons, physicians, anesthetists, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, medical social workers, dieticians as well as voluntary support groups. METHODS: From early 2007 onward, all patients older than 65 years with acute isolated hip fractures were included. During the whole inpatient treatment, all relevant data were captured prospectively. The data in 2006, before the implementation of the clinical pathway, were collected retrospectively through computer record system. A study of the length of stay in acute and rehabilitation hospital and also the short-term mortality rate was carried out to compare the difference before and after the implementation of the pathway. RESULTS: From 2007 onward, more than 1300 hip fractures were treated. After the implementation of the pathway, the preoperative length of stay was markedly shortened by 4 days, from an average of 6.1 days in 2006 to 1.5 days in 2011 (P < .05). The postoperative length of stay and the overall acute hospital length of stay also improved significantly. The length of stay in rehabilitation hospital was also significantly shorter in the 4-year period. Although the number of hip fractures increased annually with increased age and number of comorbidities each year, the inpatient mortality rate showed a gradual decrease from 2.7{\%} in 2006 to 1.25{\%} in 2010. The 30 days mortality rate also showed a decrease from 3.65{\%} in 2006 to 2.75{\%} in 2010. CONCLUSION: Geriatric hip fracture clinical pathway is an excellent approach to the geriatric hip fracture service. The most significant improvement is the dramatic shortening of the length of hospital stay. Our success in the past 5 years has proven its value and sustainability.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: There were few clinical data dosing and timing regimen for preventing postoperative delirium. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of the timing and dose of dexmedetomidine on postoperative delirium in elderly patients after laparoscopic major non-cardiac surgery. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: A total of 354 patients >65 years of age undergoing laparoscopic major non-cardiac surgery under general anesthesia received a dexmedetomidine 1 μg/kg bolus followed by 0.2-0.7 μg/kg/h infusion from induction of anesthesia to the end of surgery {$[$}group D1{$]$}); a dexmedetomidine (1 μg/kg bolus {$[$}group D2{$]$}); or saline (group S) 15 min before the end of surgery. MEASUREMENTS: The incidence and duration of delirium for 5 days after surgery and the cytokine (tumor necrosis factor-alpha TNFα, interleukin {$[$}IL{$]$}-1 β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10) and cortisol levels were measured 1 h and 24 h after surgery. MAIN RESULTS: Group D1 reduced incidence and duration of delirium and group D2 decreased its duration in patients with delirium compared to group S. IL-6 levels were significantly lower at 1 h and 24 h after surgery in group D1 than in group S, and lower at 24 h after surgery than in group D2. IL-6 levels in group D2 were significantly lower only at 1 h after surgery than in group S. However, IL-6 levels in delirious patients in group D2 were significantly lower at 1 h and 24 h after surgery than those in group S. Cortisol levels 1 h after surgery were significantly lower in groups D1 and D2 than in group S. CONCLUSIONS: The dose and timing of dexmedetomidine appeared to be important in preventing delirium. The reduced incidence and duration of delirium by dexmedetomidine was associated with reduced levels of IL-6 24 h after surgery.},

This study evaluated the effect of the 2 drugs combined on pain in patients undergoing total knee or hip arthroplasty. A total of 124 patients undergoing total knee or hip arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia were randomly assigned to either group C (n=31, placebo), group P (n=33, pregabalin), group PD (n=29, pregabalin and dexmedetomidine), or group D (n=31, dexmedetomidine). One hour before spinal anesthesia, patients received 150 mg of pregabalin or placebo orally, and a bolus dose of 0.5 µg/ kg of intravenous dexmedetomidine was given over 10 minutes before induction of spinal anesthesia. This was followed by a continuous infusion of 0.5 µg/kg/h or the same calculated volume of normal saline until completion of the surgery. Clinically relevant pain for 24 hours postoperatively, including time to first analgesic request, visual analog scale score, ketorolac dose, and volume of patient-controlled analgesia consumed, was recorded. Group C had significantly longer time to first analgesic request, higher visual analog scale scores at rest and on movement, higher ketorolac dose, and higher volume of patient-controlled analgesia for the first 24 hours postoperatively compared with the other groups. Although group PD and group D had less clinically relevant pain than group P, group PD and group D were not significantly different. Dexmedetomidine was more effective than pregabalin for clinically relevant pain. Pregabalin and dexmedetomidine combined had no synergic effect compared with dexmedetomidine alone. {$[$}Orthopedics. 2018; 41(6):365-370.{$]$}.},

@article{Lee2015,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a serious and frequent complication after surgery, especially in elderly patients. Ketamine is an N-methyl D-aspartic acid receptor antagonist with demonstrated neuroprotective effects. An intravenous bolus of a sub-anesthetic dose (0.5 mg/kg) of ketamine can reduce postoperative delirium (POD) and POCD after cardiac surgery. But, the influence of ketamine on early POCD after non-cardiac surgery is unclear. OBJECTIVES: The current study aimed to evaluate the influence of ketamine on early postoperative cognitive function after orthopedic surgery in elderly patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty six elderly patients (> 60-years-old), scheduled for elective orthopedic surgery during general anesthesia (duration of anesthesia > two hours) were enrolled. Patients received intravenous bolus, a total of 3 mL mixed with 0.9{\%} normal saline and 0.5 mg/kg ketamine (K group) or 3 mL of 0.9{\%} normal saline (N group). Three neurocognitive function tests (mini-mental status examination, trail-making test, digit substitution test), and c-reactive protein (CRP) concentration were determined before surgery and on postoperative day one (POD 1) and postoperative day six (POD 6). RESULTS: The two groups had similar demographic characteristics except for the gender. Surgical and anesthetic data were not significantly different. A statistically significant difference was observed in comparison of trail-making test score. Trail-making test score increased more in the N group (52.5 points) than the K group (13 points) at POD 1 (P = 0.047) compared with baseline scores. There were no significant differences in the mini-mental status examination, digit substitution test and CRP concentration at POD 1 and POD 6 between the two groups. POCD (the two Z-scores in more than two tests or the combined Z-score was 1.96 or more) was present in one patient (4{\%}) in the K group at POD 6 (P = 0.98). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of POCD was not significantly influenced by a bolus dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) after orthopedic surgery in elderly patients. There were no negative effects of ketamine on early POCD.},

@article{Lester2022,
	abstract = {As the population ages, more older adults will undergo surgical procedures, and common physiologic changes can raise the risk for surgical complications while increasing morbidity and mortality. In conjunction with the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, we piloted a comprehensive and interdisciplinary assessment and intervention protocol for perioperative care for patients aged >/=75 years undergoing elective general, gynecology-oncologic, and orthopedic surgery. The intervention included screening tools for cognitive, functional, and nutritional deficits, a Geriatric Nurse Champion on each inpatient surgical unit, and an interdisciplinary Geriatric Surgery Quality Committee. Our intervention group was compared to surgical patients during the same time period 1 year prior to the intervention, and the groups were well matched in demographics and comorbidities. The intervention group had significantly higher rates of advance care plan documentation in analysis of all patients (P < .001) and in subgroup analysis of those 85 and older (P = .006). The preintervention group had less postoperative delirium compared to the postintervention group but it was not significant and there was no difference in length of stay between groups. Various explanations for the minimal impact of the protocol exist: small sample size, presence of other hospital initiatives to reduce pressure ulcer and delirium, and clinician's awareness of project planning that led to incorporating ideas prior to official implementation. Future research implementing this protocol in naive and/or underperforming institutions may demonstrate a greater effect. Larger sample size as well as implementation in other surgical fields may reveal a significant impact. However, if additional study does not reveal a meaningful impact of a comprehensive geriatric assessment for surgical patients, then consideration must be made regarding unrecognized factors in surgical care for older adults or perhaps that factors cannot be mitigated in older adults because they are intrinsically a higher surgical risk.},

@article{Lewis2008,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The effect of carotid endarterectomy in lowering the risk of stroke ipsilateral to severe atherosclerotic carotid-artery stenosis is offset by complications during or soon after surgery. We compared surgery under general anaesthesia with that under local anaesthesia because prediction and avoidance of perioperative strokes might be easier under local anaesthesia than under general anaesthesia. METHODS: We undertook a parallel group, multicentre, randomised controlled trial of 3526 patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid stenosis from 95 centres in 24 countries. Participants were randomly assigned to surgery under general (n=1753) or local (n=1773) anaesthesia between June, 1999 and October, 2007. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with stroke (including retinal infarction), myocardial infarction, or death between randomisation and 30 days after surgery. Analysis was by intention to treat. The trial is registered with Current Control Trials number ISRCTN00525237. FINDINGS: A primary outcome occurred in 84 (4.8{\%}) patients assigned to surgery under general anaesthesia and 80 (4.5{\%}) of those assigned to surgery under local anaesthesia; three events per 1000 treated were prevented with local anaesthesia (95{\%} CI -11 to 17; risk ratio {$[$}RR{$]$} 0.94 {$[$}95{\%} CI 0.70 to 1.27{$]$}). The two groups did not significantly differ for quality of life, length of hospital stay, or the primary outcome in the prespecified subgroups of age, contralateral carotid occlusion, and baseline surgical risk. INTERPRETATION: We have not shown a definite difference in outcomes between general and local anaesthesia for carotid surgery. The anaesthetist and surgeon, in consultation with the patient, should decide which anaesthetic technique to use on an individual basis.

	abstract = {Importance: In adults undergoing hip fracture surgery, regional anesthesia may reduce postoperative delirium, but there is uncertainty about its effectiveness. Objective: To investigate, in older adults undergoing surgical repair for hip fracture, the effects of regional anesthesia on the incidence of postoperative delirium compared with general anesthesia. Design, Setting, and Participants: A randomized, allocation-concealed, open-label, multicenter clinical trial of 950 patients, aged 65 years and older, with or without preexisting dementia, and a fragility hip fracture requiring surgical repair from 9 university teaching hospitals in Southeastern China. Participants were enrolled between October 2014 and September 2018; 30-day follow-up ended November 2018. Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive either regional anesthesia (spinal, epidural, or both techniques combined with no sedation; n = 476) or general anesthesia (intravenous, inhalational, or combined anesthetic agents; n = 474). Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was incidence of delirium during the first 7 postoperative days. Secondary outcomes analyzed in this article include delirium severity, duration, and subtype; postoperative pain score; length of hospitalization; 30-day all-cause mortality; and complications. Results: Among 950 randomized patients (mean age, 76.5 years; 247 {$[$}26.8{\%}{$]$} male), 941 were evaluable for the primary outcome (6 canceled surgery and 3 withdrew consent). Postoperative delirium occurred in 29 (6.2{\%}) in the regional anesthesia group vs 24 (5.1{\%}) in the general anesthesia group (unadjusted risk difference {$[$}RD{$]$}, 1.1{\%}; 95{\%} CI, -1.7{\%} to 3.8{\%}; P = .48; unadjusted relative risk {$[$}RR{$]$}, 1.2 {$[$}95{\%} CI, 0.7 to 2.0{$]$}; P = .57{$]$}). Mean severity score of delirium was 23.0 vs 24.1, respectively (unadjusted difference, -1.1; 95{\%} CI, -4.6 to 3.1). A single delirium episode occurred in 16 (3.4{\%}) vs 10 (2.1{\%}) (unadjusted RD, 1.1{\%}; 95{\%} CI, -1.7{\%} to 3.9{\%}; RR, 1.6 {$[$}95{\%} CI, 0.7 to 3.5{$]$}). Hypoactive subtype in 11 (37.9{\%}) vs 5 (20.8{\%}) (RD, 11.5; 95{\%} CI, -11.0{\%} to 35.7{\%}; RR, 2.2 {$[$}95{\%} CI, 0.8 to 6.3{$]$}). Median worst pain score was 0 (IQR, 0 to 20) vs 0 (IQR, 0 to 10) (difference 0; 95{\%} CI, 0 to 0). Median length of hospitalization was 7 days (IQR, 5 to 10) vs 7 days (IQR, 6 to 10) (difference 0; 95{\%} CI, 0 to 0). Death occurred in 8 (1.7{\%}) vs 4 (0.9{\%}) (unadjusted RD, -0.8{\%}; 95{\%} CI, -2.2{\%} to 0.7{\%}; RR, 2.0 {$[$}95{\%} CI, 0.6 to 6.5{$]$}). Adverse events were reported in 106 episodes in the regional anesthesia group and 102 in the general anesthesia group; the most frequently reported adverse events were nausea and vomiting (47 {$[$}44.3{\%}{$]$} vs 34 {$[$}33.3{\%}{$]$}) and postoperative hypotension (13 {$[$}12.3{\%}{$]$} vs 10 {$[$}9.8{\%}{$]$}). Conclusions and Relevance: In patients aged 65 years and older undergoing hip fracture surgery, regional anesthesia without sedation did not significantly reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium compared with general anesthesia.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a serious complication after surgery, especially in elderly patients. The anesthesia technique is a potentially modifiable risk factor for POCD. This study assessed the effects of dexmedetomidine, propofol or midazolam sedation on POCD in elderly patients who underwent hip or knee replacement under spinal anesthesia. METHODS: The present study was a prospective randomized controlled preliminary trial. From July 2013 and December 2014, a total of 164 patients aged 65 years or older who underwent hip or knee arthroplasty at China-Japan Friendship Hospital and 41 non-surgical controls were included in this study. Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 3 sedative groups. All the patients received combined spinal-epidural anesthesia (CSEA) with midazolam, dexmedetomidine or propofol sedation. The sedative dose was adjusted to achieve light sedation (bispectral index{$[$}BIS{$]$} score between 70 and 85). All study participants and controls completed a battery of 5 neuropsychological tests before and 7 days after surgery. One year postoperatively, the patients and controls were interviewed over the telephone using the Montreal cognitive assessment 5-minute protocol. RESULTS: In all, 60 of 164 patients (36.6{\%}) were diagnosed with POCD 7 days postoperatively, POCD incidence in propofol group was significantly lower than that in dexmedetomidine and midazolam groups (18.2{\%} vs. 40.0{\%}, 51.9{\%}, χ= 6.342 and 13.603, P = 0.012 and < 0.001). When the patients were re-tested 1 year postoperatively, the incidence of POCD was not significantly different among the 3 groups (14.0{\%}, 10.6{\%} vs. 14.9{\%}, χ= 0.016 and 0.382, P = 0.899 and 0.536). CONCLUSION: Among dexmedetomidine, propofol and midazolam sedation in elderly patients, propofol sedation shows a significant advantage in term of short-term POCD incidence.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delirium is a frequent complication after cardiac surgery and its occurrence is associated with poor outcomes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of perioperative dexmedetomidine administration on the incidence of delirium in elderly patients after cardiac surgery. METHODS: This randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled trial was conducted in two tertiary hospitals in Beijing between December 1, 2014 and July 19, 2015. Eligible patients were randomized into two groups. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) was administered during anesthesia and early postoperative period for patients in the DEX group, whereas normal saline was administered in the same rate for the same duration for patients in the control (CTRL) group. The primary endpoint was the incidence of delirium during the first five days after surgery. Secondary endpoints included the cognitive function assessed on postoperative days 6 and 30, the overall incidence of non-delirium complications within 30 days after surgery, and the all-cause 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-five patients were enrolled and randomized. Dexmedetomidine did not decrease the incidence of delirium (4.9{\%} {$[$}7/142{$]$} in the DEX group vs 7.7{\%} {$[$}11/143{$]$} in the CTRL group; OR 0.62, 95{\%} CI 0.23 to 1.65, p = 0.341). Secondary endpoints were similar between the two groups; however, the incidence of pulmonary complications was slightly decreased (OR 0.51, 95{\%} CI 0.26 to 1.00, p = 0.050) and the percentage of early extubation was significantly increased (OR 3.32, 95{\%} CI 1.36 to 8.08, p = 0.008) in the DEX group. Dexmedetomidine decreased the required treatment for intraoperative tachycardia (21.1{\%} {$[$}30/142{$]$} in the DEX group vs 33.6{\%} {$[$}48/143{$]$} in the CTRL group, p = 0.019), but increased the required treatment for postoperative hypotension (84.5{\%} {$[$}120/142{$]$} in the DEX group vs 69.9{\%} {$[$}100/143{$]$} in the CTRL group, p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Dexmedetomidine administered during anesthesia and early postoperative period did not decrease the incidence of postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. However, considering the low delirium incidence, the trial might have been underpowered. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02267538.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delayed neurocognitive recovery after surgery is associated with poor outcome. Most surgeries require general anesthesia, of which sevoflurane and propofol are the most commonly used inhalational and intravenous anesthetics. The authors tested the primary hypothesis that patients with laparoscopic abdominal surgery under propofol-based anesthesia have a lower incidence of delayed neurocognitive recovery than patients under sevoflurane-based anesthesia. A second hypothesis is that there were blood biomarkers for predicting delayed neurocognitive recovery to occur. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, parallel, controlled study was performed at four hospitals in China. Elderly patients (60 yr and older) undergoing laparoscopic abdominal surgery that was likely longer than 2 h were randomized to a propofol- or sevoflurane-based regimen to maintain general anesthesia. A minimum of 221 patients was planned for each group to detect a one-third decrease in delayed neurocognitive recovery incidence in propofol group compared with sevoflurane group. The primary outcome was delayed neurocognitive recovery incidence 5 to 7 days after surgery. RESULTS: A total of 544 patients were enrolled, with 272 patients in each group. Of these patients, 226 in the propofol group and 221 in the sevoflurane group completed the needed neuropsychological tests for diagnosing delayed neurocognitive recovery, and 46 (20.8{\%}) in the sevoflurane group and 38 (16.8{\%}) in the propofol group met the criteria for delayed neurocognitive recovery (odds ratio, 0.77; 95{\%} CI, 0.48 to 1.24; P = 0.279). A high blood interleukin-6 concentration at 1 h after skin incision was associated with an increased likelihood of delayed neurocognitive recovery (odds ratio, 1.04; 95{\%} CI, 1.01 to 1.07; P = 0.007). Adverse event incidences were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Anesthetic choice between propofol and sevoflurane did not appear to affect the incidence of delayed neurocognitive recovery 5 to 7 days after laparoscopic abdominal surgery. A high blood interleukin-6 concentration after surgical incision may be an independent risk factor for delayed neurocognitive recovery.},

	abstract = {The use of intravenous dexmedetomidine during surgery has been shown to suppress inflammatory cytokines peri-operatively. It has also been demonstrated that dexmedetomidine may benefit cognitive function in elderly patients following surgery; however, it is not clear whether dexmedetomidine reduces postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) via the suppression of inflammatory cytokines. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of dexmedetomidine on early POCD and inflammatory cytokines in elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). The study comprised 120 elderly patients undergoing selective LC, who were randomly allocated to receive either dexmedetomidine intravenously (DEX group, n=60) or the same volume of normal saline (control group, n=60). Cognitive function was assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores 1 day prior to surgery, 6 h following surgery and postoperatively on days 1 and 2. Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were also measured at these time-points. On the basis of whether the patients had POCD on the first day after surgery, patients were divided into a POCD group and a non-POCD group. Blood cytokine levels were compared between the patients with and without POCD. A total of 100 patients completed both pre- and postoperative MMSE tests. At 1 day following surgery, POCD occurred in 10/50 (20{\%}) patients in the DEX group and in 21/50 (42{\%}) patients in the control group (P=0.017). At 6 h following surgery, IL-1β, IL-6 and CRP levels showed significant increases (P<0.01) compared with the baseline levels in the two groups. Furthermore, in the control group, CRP levels showed a significant increase on day 1 (P<0.001) and day 2 (P=0.017) postoperatively. In the DEX group compared with the control group, IL-1β, IL-6 and CRP levels were markedly decreased at 6 h and 1 day after surgery (P<0.01). Concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6 and CRP were significantly higher in patients who developed POCD on day 1 following surgery than in the patients who did not develop POCD (P<0.05). The findings of the current study support the hypothesis that dexmedetomidine administration during anesthesia decreases the incidence of early POCD, most likely by the mechanism of reduction of the inflammatory response level.},

	abstract = {Effect of dexmedetomidine on the brain function and hemodynamics in patients undergoing lung cancer resection were explored. Eighty-seven patients with lung cancer undergoing lung cancer resection in Weifang People's Hospital from January 2014 to June 2018 were enrolled in this study. Patients conventionally anesthetized by propofol, midazolam, sufentanil, or cisatracurium besilate (41 cases) were assigned to the control group and those anesthetized by conventional anesthetic and dexmedetomidine (46 cases) were assigned to the research group. The hemodynamic parameters, neuron‑specific enolase (NSE), and astrocyte S-100p protein (S-100β) were compared between the two groups before induction (T0), 5 min after induction (T1), at the end of surgery (T2), time of extubation (T3), and 5 min after extubation (T4). The cognitive function of patients was graded by the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) after patients recovered from anesthesia. In both the control group and the research group, the levels of mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and central venous pressure (CVP). were statistically higher at T2 and T3 than those at T0 (all P<0.05). The levels of MAP, HR, and CVP were statistically lower in the research group than those in the control group at T2 and T3 (P<0.05). The levels of serum NSE and S100βprotein in the research group and the control group increased at T2, T3, and T4, the control group was higher than the research group at each time point, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Comparison of the MMSE score and the total case number of adverse reactions between the two groups showed no statistical difference (both P>0.05). The MMSE score was positively correlated with the serum levels of NSE and S100βin the two groups (r-values were 0.661 and 0.585, P<0.05). Dexmedetomidine can effectively protect patients' perioperative brain function with small impacts on perioperative hemodynamics, so it is worthy of clinical application.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS We allocated 198 patients preparing to undertake THA into 3 groups: general anesthesia group (GA group, n=66), caudal epidural anesthesia group (CEA group, n=66), and spinal-epidural anesthesia group (SEA group, n=66). We compared postoperative adverse effects occurring in patients of the 3 anesthesia groups. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score, Minimum Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, and β-amyloid (Aβ) expression were calculated to determine the effects of different anesthesia on the postoperative pain and cognitive dysfunction of patients. RESULTS The CEA and SEA groups had lower rates of perioperative adverse effects than in the GA group. Patients in the GA group required significantly higher administration of analgesics after the surgery than those in CEA and SEA groups. Higher Aβexpression levels and VAS scores, as well as lower MMSE scores, were also seen in the GA group compared with the other 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS CEA and SEA were more effective than GA in THA, and CEA seemed to be a better anesthesia technique than SEA.},

	abstract = {Objective: Preoperative levels of cognition-related biomarkers and intraoperative cerebral ischemia and hypoxia might cause postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction (PND). The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive ability of preoperative plasma biomarkers along with cerebral oxygen saturation (SctO(2)) for the incidence of PND in elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: A total of 210 patients aged 65-80 years undergoing spinal surgery were randomly assigned to three groups (n = 70 each): propofol, sevoflurane, and propofol/sevoflurane as anesthesia maintenance protocols. Propofol was administrated target-controlled infusion of 4 μg/ml (group P), the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of inhalation anesthetic sevoflurane was 1.3 (group S), and propofol was injected with a target-controlled plasma concentration of 1.2 μg/ml, accompanied by sevoflurane inhalation 0.7 MAC (group PS). Cognitive function was evaluated 1 day preoperatively and on the 7th day postoperatively. Preoperative levels of amyloidβ-40 (Aβ-40), Aβ-42, total tau protein (T-tau), phosphorylated tau protein (P-tau), and triggering receptors on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2) were investigated. SctO(2) was monitored intraoperatively. Results: Aβ-42 had the strongest significant correlation with preoperative MoCA score. The value of Aβ-42 associated with a high risk of PND was 28.34 pg/ml, and the area under the curve (AUC) was predicted to be 0.711. When the preoperative level of Aβ-42 was 28.34 pg/ml, SctO(2max){\%} was 9.92{\%}. The AUC was predicted to be 0.872, and the sensitivity and specificity were 0.833 and 0.841, respectively. Conclusion: Under the conditions of preoperative Aβ-42 less than 28.34 pg/ml, the intraoperative fluctuation range of cerebral oxygen saturation should be maintained within 9.92{\%} to reduce the occurrence of PND in geriatric patients with MCI.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: On the basis of data indicating that volatile anesthetics induce cardioprotection in cardiac surgery, current guidelines recommend volatile anesthetics for maintenance of general anesthesia during noncardiac surgery in hemodynamic stable patients at risk for perioperative myocardial ischemia. The aim of the current study was to compare increased troponin T (TnT) values in patients receiving sevoflurane-based anesthesia or total intravenous anesthesia in elective abdominal aortic surgery. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, open, parallel-group trial comparing sevoflurane-based anesthesia (group S) and total intravenous anesthesia (group T) with regard to cardioprotection in 193 patients scheduled for elective abdominal aortic surgery. Increased TnT level on the first postoperative day was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints were postoperative complications, nonfatal coronary events and mortality. RESULTS: On the first postoperative day increased TnT values (>13 ng/l) were found in 43 (44{\%}) patients in group S versus 41 (43{\%}) in group T (P = 0.999), with no significant differences in TnT levels between the groups at any time point. Although underpowered, the authors found no differences in postoperative complications, nonfatal coronary events or mortality between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: In elective abdominal aortic surgery sevoflurane-based anesthesia did not reduce myocardial injury, evaluated by TnT release, compared with total intravenous anesthesia. These data indicate that potential cardioprotective effects of volatile anesthetics found in cardiac surgery are less obvious in major vascular surgery.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of dexmedetomidine anesthesia on postoperative cognitive function after pulmonary surgery. METHODS: A blinded, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study was performed on 60 patients (age range 65-74 years) undergoing lobectomy by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (29 in the dexmedetomidine group; 31 in the placebo group). Dexmedetomidine group patients received dexmedetomidine, and placebo group patients received an equal volume of physiological saline 20 minutes before anesthesia induction. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment 1 day before surgery and on postoperative day (POD)1, POD3, and POD7. The regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO(2)) was monitored continuously by near-infrared spectroscopy before anesthesia. RESULTS: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was significantly different between the two groups on POD1 (dexmedetomidine 26.4  $\pm$0.73 vs. placebo 25.5 $\pm$0.96) and POD3 (dexmedetomidine 27.1 $\pm$0.79 vs. placebo 26.6 $\pm$0.80). Specifically, attention and orientation scores were increased in the dexmedetomidine group on POD1 and POD3. The rSO(2) was not significantly different between the dexmedetomidine and placebo groups. CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine given before induction of anesthesia could reduce the risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction and might not decrease rSO(2). Hence, dexmedetomidine could be employed in pulmonary surgical procedures, especially for older patients with a high risk of cognitive dysfunction.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to determine whether perioperative dexmedetomidine administration can improve postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing oral and maxillofacial surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial conducted in Cangzhou Central Hospital from December 2021 to March 2022. Patients aged 65 and older underwent oral and maxillofacial surgery under general anesthesia. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to dexmedetomidine or control group. Dexmedetomidine was injected intravenously from 10 min before induction of anesthesia to 30 min before the end of surgery in dexmedetomidine group, while patients in the control group were given normal saline at the same rate during the same time period. The primary measurement indicators were the incidence and duration of delirium in the first five days after surgery. The secondary measurement indicators were Visual Analogue Score (VAS) for the first 24 hours following surgery, subjective sleep quality score within 24 hours postoperatively and intraoperative adverse reactions. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty patients were randomly assigned. Baseline characteristics were similar between two groups. The incidence and duration of postoperative delirium did not differ statistically between two groups (all P > 0.05). Compared with control group, VAS scores in dexmedetomidine group were significantly lower at 6, 12, and 24 hours after surgery (all P < 0.05); moreover, Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ) results were significantly improved 1 day after surgery in dexmedetomidine group (P < 0.05). Dexmedetomidine-related adverse reactions were similar in both groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine 10 min before induction of anesthesia to half an hour before the end of surgery did not improve postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing oral and maxillofacial surgery; however, dexmedetomidine may be associated with decreased postoperative pain and improved postoperative sleep quality.},

@article{Liu2016,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common and serious surgical complication among the elderly, especially in those with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is neuroprotective for delirium. In this study, we determined the effect of intravenously administered DEX during general anesthesia on POD in elderly aMCI patients undergoing elective hip joint or knee joint or shoulder joint replacement surgery. METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized parallel-group study of aMCI (n = 80) and normal elderly patients (n = 120). Prior to surgery, all subjects underwent neuropsychological assessment and were assigned to one of four groups: the aMCI DEX group (MD group, n = 40), the aMCI normal saline group (MN group, n = 40), the control DEX group (CD group, n = 60), and the control normal saline group (CN group, n = 60). The confusion assessment method was used to screen POD on postoperative days 1, 3, and 7. RESULTS: We found patients age was positively correlated with POD incidence in the MN group (p < 0.05) but not in the CN group (p < 0.05). DEX treatment significantly decreased POD incidence in both control and aMCI groups relative to their respective placebo groups (all p < 0.05). The fraction of patients whose normal cognitive function was not restored by day 7 after surgery was significantly higher in the MN group than the MD and CN groups (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggested that DEX treatment during surgery significantly reduced POD incidence in both normal and aMCI elderly patients, suggesting that it may be an effective option for the prevention of POD.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate effect of parecoxib sodium pretreatment combined with dexmedetomidine on early postoperative cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients after shoulder arthroscopy. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind study. SETTING: University-affiliated teaching hospital. PATIENTS: One hundred and fifty-two elderly patients scheduled for shoulder arthroscopy. INTERVENTIONS: At 15min before the induction of anesthesia, 152 patients received intravenously parecoxib sodium 40mg and dexmedetomidine at a dose of 0.5μg/kg over 15min, followed by a continuous infusion at a rate of 0.5μg/kg/h until the end of surgery. Then all patients who received postoperative patient-controlled intravenous analgesia were divided 2 groups: sufentanil(0.04μg/kg/h, S group), sufentanil (0.04μg/kg/h) plus dexmedetomidine(0.06μg/kg/h) (SD group). MEASUREMENTS: The mini-mental status examination score in SD group was significantly higher than S group at 1, 2 and 7days after surgery. The incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction during 7days after surgery in S and SD groups was respectively 17.1{\%} and 6.7{\%}. Compared with the S group, the visual analogue scale scores at rest and upon movement were significantly lower at 6, 14, 24, 36 and 48h after surgery in SD group; analgesia pump liquid amount during 24h after surgery and number of rescue analgesia during 48h after surgery were significantly lower in SD group. Jugular venous oxygen partial pressure and jugular venous oxygen saturation values in SD group were significantly higher than S group at postoperative 24h. The occurrence of nausea and vomiting within 48h after surgery in SD group were significantly lower than S group. We found no complications including respiratory depression and sinus bradycardia within 48h after surgery in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Parecoxib sodium pretreatment combined with dexmedetomidine could reduce the incidence of early postoperative cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients. This might be related to the improvement of postoperative analgesia effect and cerebral oxygen metabolism in patients.},

@article{Lu2021,
	abstract = {Importance: Postoperative ileus is common after abdominal surgery, and small clinical studies have reported that intraoperative administration of dexmedetomidine may be associated with improvements in postoperative gastrointestinal function. However, findings have been inconsistent and study samples have been small. Further examination of the effects of intraoperative dexmedetomidine on postoperative gastrointestinal function is needed. Objective: To evaluate the effects of intraoperative intravenous dexmedetomidine vs placebo on postoperative gastrointestinal function among older patients undergoing abdominal surgery. Design, Setting, and Participants: This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial was conducted at the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University in Hefei, China (lead site), and 12 other tertiary hospitals in Anhui Province, China. A total of 808 participants aged 60 years or older who were scheduled to receive abdominal surgery with an expected surgical duration of 1 to 6 hours were enrolled. The study was conducted from August 21, 2018, to December 9, 2019. Interventions: Dexmedetomidine infusion (a loading dose of 0.5 mug/kg over 15 minutes followed by a maintenance dose of 0.2 mug/kg per hour) or placebo infusion (normal saline) during surgery. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was time to first flatus. Secondary outcomes were postoperative gastrointestinal function measured by the I-FEED (intake, feeling nauseated, emesis, physical examination, and duration of symptoms) scoring system, time to first feces, time to first oral feeding, incidence of delirium, pain scores, sleep quality, postoperative nausea and vomiting, hospital costs, and hospital length of stay. Results: Among 808 patients enrolled, 404 were randomized to receive intraoperative dexmedetomidine, and 404 were randomized to receive placebo. In total, 133 patients (60 in the dexmedetomidine group and 73 in the placebo group) were excluded because of protocol deviations, and 675 patients (344 in the dexmedetomidine group and 331 in the placebo group; mean {$[$}SD{$]$} age, 70.2 {$[$}6.1{$]$} years; 445 men {$[$}65.9{\%}{$]$}) were included in the per-protocol analysis. The dexmedetomidine group had a significantly shorter time to first flatus (median, 65 hours {$[$}IQR, 48-78 hours{$]$} vs 78 hours {$[$}62-93 hours{$]$}, respectively; P < .001), time to first feces (median, 85 hours {$[$}IQR, 68-115 hours{$]$} vs 98 hours {$[$}IQR, 74-121 hours{$]$}; P = .001), and hospital length of stay (median, 13 days {$[$}IQR, 10-17 days{$]$} vs 15 days {$[$}IQR, 11-18 days{$]$}; P = .005) than the control group. Postoperative gastrointestinal function (as measured by the I-FEED score) and delirium incidence were similar in the dexmedetomidine and control groups (eg, 248 patients {$[$}72.1{\%}{$]$} vs 254 patients {$[$}76.7{\%}{$]$}, respectively, had I-FEED scores indicating normal postoperative gastrointestinal function; 18 patients {$[$}5.2{\%}{$]$} vs 12 patients {$[$}3.6{\%}{$]$} had delirium on postoperative day 3). Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, the administration of intraoperative dexmedetomidine reduced the time to first flatus, time to first feces, and length of stay after abdominal surgery. These results suggest that this therapy may be a viable strategy to enhance postoperative recovery of gastrointestinal function among older adults.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The use of propofol compared with isoflurane is associated with improved patient comfort and decreased costs. However, as the cost saving, the quicker recovery time and patient comfort may not be evident if sevoflurane is substituted for isoflurane; these two anaesthetic agents were analysed in elderly patients. METHODS: In a prospective randomized study, 96 patients undergoing elective ophthalmic surgery received either total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol (Group P), propofol for induction and sevoflurane for maintenance (Group P/S) or sevoflurane for inhalation induction and maintenance (Group S). Analyses focussed on haemodynamics, the quality of recovery, and the costs for the anaesthetic and the entire procedure. RESULTS: Bradycardia or hypotension, mainly registered in Groups P and P/S, did not influence patients' recovery. In Group S, postoperative nausea and vomiting occurred frequently, and 50{\%} of patients complained of discomfort during induction. In Group P/S, the costs for anaesthetics and total costs were lower than those in Groups P and S. CONCLUSIONS: Propofol- and sevoflurane-based maintenance of anaesthesia were similar with regard to patient comfort and recovery in the elderly. Cost analysis revealed that it was less expensive to use propofol for induction and sevoflurane for maintenance than to use either propofol or sevoflurane as sole agents for anaesthesia.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of dexmedetomidine in reducing the occurrence of postoperative delirium in elderly patients after total hip joint replacement. METHODS: Patients who have undergone total hip joint replacement and who were admitted to the hospital from August 1, 2017, to August 1, 2020, were included in this study. After initial screening, 327 out of 385 patients were selected and randomly assigned to either dexmedetomidine (0.1 μg/kg/h, n=163) or placebo (n=164) groups. The occurrence of delirium was examined twice a day for one week by using the Confusion Assessment Method. Furthermore, 30-day all-cause mortality, hospitalization duration and costs, and the presence of any postoperative complications were also evaluated. RESULTS: The postoperative delirium incidence was significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group compared to that in the placebo group (13.8 vs. 29.3{\%}, p<0.01). The hospitalization duration (17.2$\pm$6.3 vs. 15.6$\pm$4.2, p=0.006) and cost (4.5$\pm$0.9 vs. 4.9$\pm$1.1, p=0.001) in the dexmedetomidine group were also lower than those in the placebo group. Meanwhile, no significant difference between the 30-day all-cause mortality of the two groups was observed (p=0.60). In terms of safety, no significant differences between the occurrence of hypotension and bradycardia were also observed. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that the dexmedetomidine medication can reduce the postoperative delirium incidence in older total hip joint replacement patients and can subsequently decrease the related hospitalization duration and cost of these patients.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Postoperative delirium is a common complication of cardiac surgery. This study aimed to assess the effect of supplementing dexmedetomidine infusion with oral melatonin in prevention of postoperative delirium after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Methods: 110 patients of both sexes above 60 years of age were included. Anesthetic management was standardized. Patients were randomly allocated into one of the two study groups, dexmedetomidine/melatonin (DM) group or dexmedetomidine (D) group. Patients in the DM group received oral Melatonin tablet 5 mg the night before surgery and same dose was repeated every 24 hours for 3 postoperative days. After completion of surgery and upon ICU arrival, patients in both groups received a bolus of 0.4 µg/kg dexmedetomidine followed by 0.2--0.7 µg/kg/h infusion, for 24 maximum hours. Delirium was assessed for 5 days postoperatively at 12 hr intervals using confusion assessment method (CAM) for ICU and after discharge from ICU to surgical ward using CAM. Delirious patients were treated with IV haloperidol. Results: No significant differences between studied groups regarding baseline, preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative characteristics. Incidence of delirium was significantly lower, onset significantly more delayed, and duration was significantly shorter in group-DM as compared to group-D. No significant differences between all cases, cases who had delirium, and cases who did not have delirium in the two groups as regards extubation time, ICU stay, and hospital stay. Conclusion: supplementing dexmedetomidine with melatonin decreases incidence, delays onset, and shortens duration of postoperative delirium in patients above 60 years of age undergoing CABG surgery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Post-operative cognitive dysfunction is the subtle cerebral complication temporally seen following surgery. The aim of this study was to compare the influence of either general anesthesia (GA) or epidural anesthesia (EA) on the early post-operative neurocognitive outcome in elderly (>59 years) subjects undergoing hip and knee surgery. METHODS: A total of 60 patients were recruited in a prospective, randomized, parallel-group study, comparable by age and sex. They were enrolled and randomized to receive either EA (n = 30) or GA (n = 30). All of them were screened using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), with components of the Kolkata Cognitive Screening Battery. The operated patients were re-evaluated 1 week after surgery using the same scale. The data collected were analyzed to assess statistical significance. RESULTS: We observed no statistical difference in cognitive behavior in either group pre-operatively, which were comparable with respect to age, sex and type of surgery. Grossly, a significant difference was seen between the two groups with respect to the perioperative changes in verbal fluency for categories and MMSE scores. However, these differences were not significant after the application of the Bonferroni correction for multiple analyses, except the significant differences observed only in the MMSE scores. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a difference in cognitive outcome with GA compared with EA. Certain aspects of the cognition were affected to a greater extent in this group of patients undergoing hip and knee surgery.},

@article{Mangusan2015,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delirium after surgery is a common condition that leads to poor outcomes. Few studies have examined the effect of postoperative delirium on outcomes after cardiac surgery. OBJECTIVES: To assess the relationship between delirium after cardiac surgery and the following outcomes: length of stay after surgery, prevalence of falls, discharge to a nursing facility, discharge to home with home health services, and use of inpatient physical therapy. METHODS: Electronic medical records of 656 cardiac surgery patients were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: Postoperative delirium occurred in 161 patients (24.5{\%}). Patients with postoperative delirium had significantly longer stays (P < .001) and greater prevalence of falls (P < .001) than did patients without delirium. Patients with delirium also had a significantly greater likelihood for discharge to a nursing facility (P < .001) and need for home health services if discharged to home (P < .001) and a significantly higher need for inpatient physical therapy (P < .001). Compared with patients without postoperative delirium, patients who had this complication were more likely to have received zolpidem and benzodiazepines postoperatively and to have a history of arrhythmias, renal disease, and congestive heart failure. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who have delirium after cardiac surgery have poorer outcomes than do similar patients without this complication. Development and implementation of an extensive care plan to address postoperative delirium is necessary for cardiac surgery patients who are at risk for or have delirium after the surgery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study aimed to compare the effects of preoperative administration of midazolam and dexmedetomidine on cognitive dysfunction prevention after cataract surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This research was a double-blind controlled clinical trial. In this study, 150 candidates for cataract surgery under general anesthesia, over 65 years, and similar to American Society of Anesthesiologists I and II characteristics were selected as the sample and randomly assigned to three groups. Participants of these three groups were treated with 0.1 mg/kg of midazolam, 1 μg/kg of dexmedetomidine, and the same volume of normal saline (control), respectively. Hemodynamic parameters and cognitive dysfunction score of the participants were measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) before the surgery, 24 h and 1 week after the surgery. RESULTS: An evaluation of hemodynamic parameters before anesthesia up to 24 h after the surgery showed no significant difference between the midazolam, dexmedetomidine, and control groups in terms of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and blood oxygen saturation (P > 0.05). In addition, there was no statistically significant difference between the midazolam and dexmedetomidine groups in the MMSE score before the surgery and 24 h and 1 week after that (P > 0.05). However, there was a significant difference between these two groups and control (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference between midazolam and dexmedetomidine in reducing postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). However, there is a significant difference between these two groups and control. Hence, either midazolam or dexmedetomidine can be prescribed to reduce POCD in cataract surgeries.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Delirium (or acute confusional state) affects 35{\%} to 65{\%} of patients after hip-fracture repair, and has been independently associated with poor functional recovery. We performed a randomized trial in an orthopedic surgery service at an academic hospital to determine whether proactive geriatrics consultation can reduce delirium after hip fracture. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, blinded. SETTING: Inpatient academic tertiary medical center. PARTICIPANTS: 126 consenting patients 65 and older (mean age 79 +/- 8 years, 79{\%} women) admitted emergently for surgical repair of hip fracture. MEASUREMENTS: Detailed assessment through interviews with patients and designated proxies and review of medical records was performed at enrollment to ascertain prefracture status. Subjects were then randomized to proactive geriatrics consultation, which began preoperatively or within 24 hours of surgery, or "usual care." A geriatrician made daily visits for the duration of the hospitalization and made targeted recommendations based on a structured protocol. To ascertain study outcomes, all subjects underwent daily, blinded interviews for the duration of their hospitalization, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Delirium Symptom Interview (DSI), and the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS). Delirium was diagnosed using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) algorithm. RESULTS: The 62 patients randomized to geriatrics consultation were not significantly different (P>.1) from the 64 usual-care patients in terms of age, gender, prefracture dementia, comorbidity, type of hip fracture, or type of surgical repair. Sixty-one percent of geriatrics consultation patients were seen preoperatively and all were seen within 24 hours postoperatively. A mean of 10 recommendations were made throughout the duration of the hospitalization, with 77{\%} adherence by the orthopedics team. Delirium occurred in 20 /62 (32{\%}) intervention patients, versus 32 / 64 (50{\%}) usual-care patients (P =.04), representing a relative risk of 0.64 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI) = 0.37-0.98) for the consultation group. One case of delirium was prevented for every 5.6 patients in the geriatrics consultation group. There was an even greater reduction in cases of severe delirium, occurring in 7/ 60 (12{\%}) of intervention patients and 18 / 62 (29{\%}) of usual-care patients, with a relative risk of 0.40 (95{\%} CI = 0.18-0.89). Despite this reduction in delirium, length of stay did not significantly differ between intervention and usual-care groups (median +/- interquartile range = 5 +/- 2 days in both groups), likely because protocols and pathways predetermined length of stay. In subgroup analyses, geriatrics consultation was most effective in reducing delirium in patients without prefracture dementia or activities of daily living (ADL) functional impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Proactive geriatrics consultation was successfully implemented with good adherence after hip-fracture repair. Geriatrics consultation reduced delirium by over one-third, and reduced severe delirium by over one-half. Our trial provides strong preliminary evidence that proactive geriatrics consultation may play an important role in the acute hospital management of hip-fracture patients.},

	abstract = {Background: Coronary artery bypass graft is one of common cardiac surgeries which unfortunately accompany with some adverse events such as delirium. Proinflammatory processes play an important role in pathogenesis of post-operative delirium. Therefore, the effect of dexamethasone (DEX) on post-operative delirium after cardiac surgery was evaluated. Materials and Methods: This randomized clinical trial study was conducted with objective of evaluation of DEX effects on post-operative deliriums and complications after cardiac surgery. Ninety three eligible patients who undergone coronary arteries bypass graft was divided into two groups of DEX with 43patients and placebo (PCB) with 50patients. DEX group taken 8mg DEX intra-venous before induction of anesthesia followed by 8mg every 8h for 3day and other group received PCB in same way. Results: All patients assessed by Mini-mental status questionnaire and psychiatric interviewing with aim of diagnosing delirium. Extubation time of DEX group was significantly reduced. The first post-operative day deliriums, extubation time, hospital, and intensive-care unit length of stay significantly reduced in DEX group without increasing serious complications such as infectious disease. After administration of DEX only hyperglycemia as an adverse event was increased in DEX group. Other complications of renal, cardiac, cerebrovascular and respiratory system did not show any significant differences between groups. Conclusion: Pre-operative administration of DEX might safely protect brain of the patients who undergone cardiac surgery against post-operative delirium.},

The influence of the type of anesthesia and shunting on early postoperative neurocognitive function remains unclear. Therefore, we analyzed the cognitive function after CEA using a battery of psychometric tests before surgery and on the first postoperative day. METHODS: Twenty nine patients under regional and 28 under general anesthesia were included in the study. Regional anesthesia was administered inducing a superficial cervical block, and the general anesthesia was induced using a standardized manner. Then cognitive function was tested using a battery of psychometric tests before and 24 hours after surgery. S 100 beta was determined at the same time points. RESULTS: A statistical difference was found between the results of the testing before and after CEA: decline in digit symbol test (9{\%}), perceptual speed (6{\%}), and spatial working memory (44{\%}) and improvement in verbal fluency (6{\%}) and attention (5{\%}). The only intraoperative factor that correlated with the cognitive dysfunction was shunt insertion; patients with a shunt had a lower perceptual speed (P=0.005) and worse spatial working memory (P=0.004). No correlation was found between the type of anesthesia or S 100 beta level and any psychometric test, but these results might be influenced by the small sample size in our study. CONCLUSIONS: Shunt insertion was the only parameter correlated with cognitive decline on the first day after CEA. Regional anesthesia might offer indirect benefit because of a reduced need of shunting in wakeful patients. Larger studies are required to clarify the role of shunting and type of anesthesia in early neurocognitive deficit after CEA and its impact on the quality of life.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Older adults undergoing elective surgery experience higher rates of preventable postoperative complications than younger patients. OBJECTIVE: To assess clinical outcomes for older adults undergoing elective abdominal surgery via a collaborative intervention by surgery, geriatrics, and anesthesia focused on perioperative health optimization. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Perioperative Optimization of Senior Health (POSH) is a quality improvement initiative with prospective data collection. Participants in an existing geriatrics-based clinic within a single-site academic health center were included if they were at high risk for complications (ie, older than 85 years or older than 65 years with cognitive impairment, recent weight loss, multimorbidity, or polypharmacy) undergoing elective abdominal surgery. Outcomes were compared with a control group of patients older than 65 years who underwent similar surgeries by the same group of general surgeons immediately before implementation of POSH. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes included length of stay, 7- and 30-day readmissions, and level of care at discharge. Secondary outcomes were delirium and other major postoperative complications. Outcomes data were derived from institutional databases linked with electronic health records and billing data sets. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-three POSH patients were compared with 143 patients in the control group. On average, patients in the POSH group were older compared with those in the control group (75.6 vs 71.9 years; P < .001; 95{\%} CI, 2.27 to 5.19) and had more chronic conditions (10.6 vs 8.5; P = .001; 95{\%} CI, 0.86 to 3.35). Median length of stay was shorter among POSH patients (4 days vs 6 days; P < .001; 95{\%} CI, -1.06 to -4.21). Patients in the POSH group had lower readmission rates at 7 days (5 of 180 {$[$}2.8{\%}{$]$} vs 14 of 142 {$[$}9.9{\%}{$]$}; P = .007; 95{\%} CI, 0.09 to 0.74) and 30 days (14 of 180 {$[$}7.8{\%}{$]$} vs 26 of 142 {$[$}18.3{\%}{$]$}; P = .004; 95{\%} CI, 0.19 to 0.75) and were more likely to be discharged home with self-care (114 of 183 {$[$}62.3{\%}{$]$} vs 73 of 143 {$[$}51.1{\%}{$]$}; P = .04; 95{\%} CI, 1.02 to 2.47). Patients in the POSH group experienced fewer mean number of complications (0.9 vs 1.4; P < .001; 95{\%} CI, -0.13 to -0.89) despite higher rates of documented delirium (52 of 183 {$[$}28.4{\%}{$]$} vs 8 of 143 {$[$}5.6{\%}{$]$}; P < .001; 95{\%} CI, 3.06 to 14.65). A greater proportion of POSH patients underwent laparoscopic procedures (92 of 183 {$[$}50{\%}{$]$} vs 55 of 143 {$[$}38.5{\%}{$]$}; P = .001; 95{\%} CI, 1.04 to 2.52). Tests for interactions between POSH patients and procedure type were insignificant for all outcomes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Despite higher mean age and morbidity burden, older adults who participated in an interdisciplinary perioperative care intervention had fewer complications, shorter hospitalizations, more frequent discharge to home, and fewer readmissions than a comparison group.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Peripheral nerve block is a preferable method for elderly patients receiving hip arthroplasty. Sedation with dexmedetomidine may reduce postoperative delirium (POD). The aim of this study was to investigate whether intraoperative sedation with dexmedetomidine, as a supplementary to peripheral nerve block for elderly patients receiving total hip arthroplasty, can decrease the prevalence of POD. METHODS: A prospective, randomized controlled study was conducted with patients 65 years of age or older who underwent total hip arthroplasty between June 2016 and June 2017. The patients were randomly assigned to receive a lumbosacral plexus plus T12 paravertebral block supplemented with propofol or dexmedetomidine for sedation. Incidence of POD was the primary endpoint and was determined with the confusion assessment method, and incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) was assessed with the mini-mental state examination. The time of ambulation, discharge time, and complications over a 30-day postsurgery period were also recorded. RESULTS: A total of 296 patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups. The patients sedated with dexmedetomidine had lower incidences of POD and POCD and were out of bed and discharged sooner than the patients sedated with propofol. There was no difference in complications between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: As a supplementary to peripheral nerve block, intraoperative sedation with dexmedetomidine could be associated with a lower incidence of POD, which may have benefits on reducing the incidence of early POCD and offering a better short-term recovery for elderly patients receiving hip arthroplasty.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dexmedetomidine potentially confers an advantage to reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium (POD) in surgical patients. Anti-inflammation is important effect of this sedative drug. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether the effect of dexmedetomidine on the postoperative cognitive function is via inhibiting peripheral inflammation. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, controlled study was conducted with patients 65 years of age or above who received total knee arthroplasty from January 2019 to May 2019. The patients were randomly assigned to receive spinal anesthesia supplemented with propofol or dexmedetomidine for sedation. The incidence of POD was the primary endpoint and was evaluated with the Confusion Assessment Method, and incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction was assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination. Blood samples were collected postoperatively to test the plasma concentrations of interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and S100β. RESULTS: A total of 366 patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups. Patients who received dexmedetomidine sedation had lower incidences of POD and better postoperative cognitive function than patients sedated with propofol. There was no difference in postoperative plasma concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-αand interleukin-6 between the 2 groups. The concentration of S100β48 hours after surgery was higher in patients sedated with propofol than in patients who received dexmedetomidine sedation. CONCLUSION: Intraoperative sedation with dexmedetomidine conferred better postoperative neurocognitive function for elderly patients who received total knee arthroplasty. This effect was unrelated to the modulation of dexmedetomidine on peripheral inflammation.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Intraoperative hypotension during hip fracture surgery is frequent in the elderly. No study has compared the haemodynamic effect of hypobaric unilateral spinal anaesthesia (HUSA) and standardised general anaesthesia (GA) in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgical repair. METHODS: We performed a prospective, randomised open study, including 40 patients aged over 75 years, comparing the haemodynamic effects of HUSA (5 mg isobaric bupivacaine with 5 μg sufentanil and 1 mL sterile water) and GA (induction with etomidate/remifentanil and maintenance with desflurane/remifentanil). An incidence of severe hypotension, defined by a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >40{\%} from baseline, was the primary endpoint. RESULTS: The incidence of severe hypotension was lower in the HUSA group compared with that in the GA group (32{\%} vs. 71{\%}, respectively, p=0.03). The median {$[$}IQR{$]$} ephedrine consumption was lower (p=0.001) in the HUSA group (6 mg, 0-17 mg) compared with that in the GA group (36 mg, 21-57 mg). Intraoperative muscle relaxation and patients' and surgeons' satisfaction were similar between groups. No difference was observed in 5-day complications or 30-day mortality. CONCLUSION: This study shows that HUSA provides better haemodynamic stability than GA, with lower consumption of ephedrine and similar operating conditions. This new approach of spinal anaesthesia seems to be safe and effective in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgery.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate the feasibility of Ramelteon for the prevention of delirium after lung cancer surgery in elderly patients. METHODS: Medical records of patients over 70 years old, who underwent anatomical pulmonary resection for lung cancer at our institution from January 2013 to December 2015, were reviewed. Patients treated in 2013 and 2014 were used as a control group. Ramelteon was administered daily for 7 days after surgery. The incidence of delirium was determined based on the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC). Scores of ≥4 and 1-3 points were used for the diagnoses of delirium and a pre-delirious state, respectively. RESULTS: There were 24 patients in the Ramelteon group and 58 patients in the control group. ICDSC scores of ≥4 points were found for no patients in the Ramelteon group and 5 (9{\%}) in the control group, whereas 21 (88{\%}) and 49 (85{\%}) patients, in the respective groups, had ICDSC scores of 0 points. The average incidence of events, associated with delirium, showed a trend of being lower in the Ramelteon group (0.25 $\pm$0.74 vs 1.58 $\pm$4.93, P = 0.061), and all events in the Ramelteon group occurred on the day of surgery. Thus, only one day was required for complete recovery from delirium in the Ramelteon group, whereas 8 days were needed in the control group. The peak delirious state occurred after 5 days in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Ramelteon is likely to reduce the incidence and intensity of delirium after surgery for lung cancer in elderly patients.},

	abstract = {Background: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in elderly patients is a common complaint after prolonged surgeries. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of intraoperative infusion of Dexmedetomidine on POCD. Methods: 50 patients aged more than 60 years old undergoing elective abdominal surgery expected to last more than 2 hours were randomized into 2 groups of 25 patients each: Those receiving Dexmedetomidine at a dose of 0.4 lg/kg/h, group (A) and those receiving 0.9{\%} normal saline as placebo group (B). All patients underwent neuropsychometric tests (Montreal cognitive assessment and Stroop color word interference tests) the day before the surgery and 24 h after the surgery, and one week postoperatively. Results: The use of Dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant during Sevoflurane anesthesia did not have significant effect on protection against POCD in one day and one week postoperatively. The anesthetic and analgesic sparing effect of Dexmedetomidine was significantly proved by lower Sevoflurane need and significant lesser amount of total 24 hours postoperative Fentanyl requirements, but with significant prolonged extubation and orientation times in Dexmedetomidine group than placebo group. Conclusions: The findings of this pilot study suggest that intraoperative use of Dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant in major surgery in elderly patients was not associated with significant protection against POCD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a frequent complication in older patients. Dexmedetomidine might be effective in decreasing the incidence of POD. We hypothesised that adding low-dose rate dexmedetomidine infusion to a propofol sedation regimen would have fewer side-effects and would counteract the possible delirium producing properties of propofol, resulting in a lower risk of POD than propofol with placebo. METHODS: In this double-blind placebo-controlled trial, patients ≥60 yr old undergoing on-pump cardiac surgery were randomised 1:1 to the following postoperative sedative regimens: a propofol infusion and dexmedetomidine (0.4 μg kg(-1) h(-1)) or a propofol infusion and saline 0.9{\%} (placebo group). The study drug was started at chest closure and continued for 10 h. The primary endpoint was in-hospital POD, assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method and chart review method. RESULTS: POD over the course of hospital stay occurred in 31/177 (18{\%}) and 33/172 (19{\%}) patients in the dexmedetomidine and placebo arm, respectively (P=0.687; odds ratio=0.89; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.52-1.54). The incidence of POD in the intensive care alone, or on the ward alone, was also not significantly different between the groups. Subjects in the dexmedetomidine group spent less median time in a delirious state (P=0.026). Median administered postoperative norepinephrine was significantly higher in the dexmedetomidine group (P<0.001). One patient in the dexmedetomidine group and 10 patients in the placebo group died in the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Adding low-dose rate dexmedetomidine to a sedative regimen based on propofol did not result in a different risk of in-hospital delirium in older patients undergoing cardiac surgery. With a suggestion of both harm and benefit in secondary outcomes, supplementing postoperative propofol with dexmedetomidine cannot be recommended based on this study.

	abstract = {Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) patients are at increased risk of post-operative delirium (POD) given their demographics and functional impairment. Certain pharmacologic agents are known to cause delirium, but those that cause delirium following TJA are unknown. Our aim was to explore if specific anesthetic agents, opiate pain medications, or benzodiazepines are associated with POD following TJA. A matched case (n=98)-control (n=365) design and conditional logistic regression model were used to examine risk factors for POD among TJA patients at our institution from 2006 to 2010. The model was adjusted for gender, pre-operative alcohol use, and pre-operative depression. Our data suggest that isoflurane and benzodiazepines are associated with an increased risk of delirium in TJA patients and should be used with caution. Hydromorphone and morphine did not increase the risk of delirium in TJA patients and may be considered for post-operative pain control.},

@article{Nesek-Adam2012,
	abstract = {The optimal anesthetic technique for peripheral vascular surgery remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of spinal versus general anesthesia on postoperative pain, analgesic requirements and postoperative comfort in patients undergoing peripheral vascular surgery. A total of 40 patients scheduled for peripheral vascular surgery were randomly assigned to two groups of 20 patients each to receive general anesthesia (GA) or spinal anesthesia (SA). In GA group, anesthesia was induced using thiopental and fentanyl. Vecuronium was used for muscle relaxation. Anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane and nitrous oxide. In the SA group, hyperbaric 0.5{\%} bupivacaine was injected into the subarachnoid space. Postoperative pain was assessed for 24 hours by a visual analog scale during three assessment periods: 0-4, 4-12 and 12-24 h as well as analgesic requirements. Patients were also asked to assess their postoperative state as satisfactory or unsatisfactory with regard to the pain, side effects and postoperative nausea and vomiting. Visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score was significantly lower in the group SA compared with group GA. This effect was mainly due to the lower pain score during the first study period. The patients received general anesthesia also reported a significantly higher rate of unsatisfactory postoperative comfort than those receiving spinal anesthesia. We conclude that spinal anesthesia is superior to general anesthesia when considering patients' satisfaction, side effects and early postoperative analgesic management.},

@article{Neuman2021,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The effects of spinal anesthesia as compared with general anesthesia on the ability to walk in older adults undergoing surgery for hip fracture have not been well studied. METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic, randomized superiority trial to evaluate spinal anesthesia as compared with general anesthesia in previously ambulatory patients 50 years of age or older who were undergoing surgery for hip fracture at 46 U.S. and Canadian hospitals. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive spinal or general anesthesia. The primary outcome was a composite of death or an inability to walk approximately 10 ft (3 m) independently or with a walker or cane at 60 days after randomization. Secondary outcomes included death within 60 days, delirium, time to discharge, and ambulation at 60 days. RESULTS: A total of 1600 patients were enrolled; 795 were assigned to receive spinal anesthesia and 805 to receive general anesthesia. The mean age was 78 years, and 67.0{\%} of the patients were women. A total of 666 patients (83.8{\%}) assigned to spinal anesthesia and 769 patients (95.5{\%}) assigned to general anesthesia received their assigned anesthesia. Among patients in the modified intention-to-treat population for whom data were available, the composite primary outcome occurred in 132 of 712 patients (18.5{\%}) in the spinal anesthesia group and 132 of 733 (18.0{\%}) in the general anesthesia group (relative risk, 1.03; 95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$}, 0.84 to 1.27; P = 0.83). An inability to walk independently at 60 days was reported in 104 of 684 patients (15.2{\%}) and 101 of 702 patients (14.4{\%}), respectively (relative risk, 1.06; 95{\%} CI, 0.82 to 1.36), and death within 60 days occurred in 30 of 768 (3.9{\%}) and 32 of 784 (4.1{\%}), respectively (relative risk, 0.97; 95{\%} CI, 0.59 to 1.57). Delirium occurred in 130 of 633 patients (20.5{\%}) in the spinal anesthesia group and in 124 of 629 (19.7{\%}) in the general anesthesia group (relative risk, 1.04; 95{\%} CI, 0.84 to 1.30). CONCLUSIONS: Spinal anesthesia for hip-fracture surgery in older adults was not superior to general anesthesia with respect to survival and recovery of ambulation at 60 days. The incidence of postoperative delirium was similar with the two types of anesthesia. (Funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute; REGAIN ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02507505.).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The REGAIN (Regional versus General Anesthesia for Promoting Independence after Hip Fracture) trial found similar ambulation and survival at 60 days with spinal versus general anesthesia for hip fracture surgery. Trial outcomes evaluating pain, prescription analgesic use, and patient satisfaction have not yet been reported. OBJECTIVE: To compare pain, analgesic use, and satisfaction after hip fracture surgery with spinal versus general anesthesia. DESIGN: Preplanned secondary analysis of a pragmatic randomized trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02507505). SETTING: 46 U.S. and Canadian hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 50 years or older undergoing hip fracture surgery. INTERVENTION: Spinal or general anesthesia. MEASUREMENTS: Pain on postoperative days 1 through 3; 60-, 180-, and 365-day pain and prescription analgesic use; and satisfaction with care. RESULTS: A total of 1600 patients were enrolled. The average age was 78 years, and 77{\%} were women. A total of 73.5{\%} (1050 of 1428) of patients reported severe pain during the first 24 hours after surgery. Worst pain over the first 24 hours after surgery was greater with spinal anesthesia (rated from 0 {$[$}no pain{$]$} to 10 {$[$}worst pain imaginable{$]$}; mean difference, 0.40 {$[$}95{\%} CI, 0.12 to 0.68{$]$}). Pain did not differ across groups at other time points. Prescription analgesic use at 60 days occurred in 25{\%} (141 of 563) and 18.8{\%} (108 of 574) of patients assigned to spinal and general anesthesia, respectively (relative risk, 1.33 {$[$}CI, 1.06 to 1.65{$]$}). Satisfaction was similar across groups. LIMITATION: Missing outcome data and multiple outcomes assessed. CONCLUSION: Severe pain is common after hip fracture. Spinal anesthesia was associated with more pain in the first 24 hours after surgery and more prescription analgesic use at 60 days compared with general anesthesia.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: We wished to compare the effectiveness of intravenous-based (IV) and epidural-based (EPI) techniques for anesthesia and postoperative analgesia in elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Effectiveness was compared in terms of reduction of postoperative pain and adverse events, and achieving a high level of patient satisfaction. METHODS: Thirty American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I-II patients aged more than 65 years, scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, were enrolled in this study. The patients in the IV group (n = 15) received modified neurolept anesthesia with droperidol 0.2 mgxkg(-1) and pentazocine 0.15-0.3 mgxkg(-1) (maximum dose of 1.0 mgxkg(-1)) and 60{\%} nitrous oxide in oxygen, followed by postoperative intravenous infusion of 20 microgxml(-1) buprenorphine, provided with a patient-controlled analgesia pump programmed to deliver a bolus of 0.5 ml with a lockout interval of 15 min and a background infusion of 0.5 mlxh(-1). The patients in the EPI group (n = 15) had combined epidural analgesia and general anesthesia with sevoflurane and 60{\%} nitrous oxide in oxygen, followed by the epidural infusion of a 0.125{\%} bupivacaine and 5 microg x ml(-1) buprenorphine mixture by means of an on-demand analgesic system (bolus of 2 ml, lockout interval of 60 min, and background infusion of 2 mlxh(-1)). RESULTS: The quality of postoperative analgesia was similar in the two groups. The incidences of intraoperative hypotension and bradycardia and postoperative hypotension were significantly lower in the IV group than in the EPI group (P < 0.05). A significantly higher level of patient satisfaction was found in the IV group compared with that in the EPI group (P < 0.05). The major contributor to dissatisfaction in the EPI group was anxiety or discomfort associated with the epidural procedures. CONCLUSION: Modified neurolept anesthesia with pentazocine and postoperative i.v. analgesia with buprenorphine were superior to epidural-based techniques, in terms of hemodynamic stability and patient satisfaction, in elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Post-operative mental dysfunction may be an important problem in elderly patients. This study was designed to compare the effects of propofol and sevoflurane anesthesia on recovery characteristics and the incidence of post-operative delirium (POD) in long-duration laparoscopic surgery for elderly patients. METHODS: Fifty ASA physical status I-II patients over the age of 65 scheduled for laparoscopic surgery lasting 3 h or more randomly received propofol (group P, n = 25) or sevoflurane (group S, n = 25) for both induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. Both groups were combined with continuous perioperative epidural analgesia. The level of primary anesthetics was adjusted to maintain changes in mean arterial pressure within 20{\%} of the pre-anesthetic values. The emergence times from anesthesia (eye opening, extubation, response to command, and orientation) were recorded, and the occurrence of POD was assessed by the delirium rating scale (DRS) during the first 3 days after surgery. All patients received oxygen and continuous epidural analgesia postoperatively. RESULTS: Immediate emergence, i.e. eye opening and extubation was significantly faster after sevoflurane (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the incidences of POD in the two groups during the first 3 days after surgery. The scores for DRS on day 2 and 3 after surgery, however, were significantly higher in group P than in group S (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Sevoflurane may be preferable to propofol for general anesthesia in combination with epidural analgesia with respect to less effect on mental function during the early postoperative period for long-duration laparoscopic surgery in elderly patients.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare operating conditions, intraoperative adverse events, recovery profiles, postoperative adverse effects, patient satisfaction, and costs of small-dose lidocaine spinal anesthesia with those of general anesthesia using fentanyl and propofol for elderly outpatient prostate biopsy. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, blind study. SETTING: Outpatient anesthesia unit at a municipal hospital. PATIENTS: 80 ASA physical status I and II patients, aged 65 to 80 years, scheduled for outpatient prostate biopsy. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were assigned to receive either spinal anesthesia with 10 mg of hyperbaric 1{\%} lidocaine (L group, n=40) or anesthetic induction with fentanyl 1 microg.kg-1 IV and 1.0 mg.kg-1 propofol injected at 90 mg.kg-1.h-1, followed by continuous infusion at 6 mg.kg-1.h-1 (F/P group, n=40). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Both anesthetic techniques provided acceptable operating conditions for the surgeon. However, a significantly higher frequency of intraoperative hypotension was found in the F/P group than in the L group (P<0.05). Time to home readiness was shorter in the F/P group (P<0.05). Both techniques had no major postoperative adverse effects and resulted in a high rate of patient satisfaction. Total costs were significantly lower in the L group than in the F/P group (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Spinal anesthesia with 10 mg of hyperbaric 1{\%} lidocaine may be a more suitable alternative to general anesthesia with fentanyl and propofol for ambulatory elderly prostate biopsy in terms of safety and costs.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Postoperative delirium, associated with negative consequences including longer hospital stays and worse cognitive and physical outcomes, is frequently accompanied by sleep-wake disturbance. Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy and short-term safety of ramelteon, a melatonin receptor agonist, for the prevention of postoperative delirium in older patients undergoing orthopedic surgery. DESIGN: A quadruple-masked randomized placebo-controlled trial (Clinical Trials.gov NCT02324153) conducted from March 2017 to June 2019. SETTING: Tertiary academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 65 years or older, undergoing elective primary or revision hip or knee replacement. INTERVENTION: Ramelteon (8 mg) or placebo MEASUREMENTS: Eighty participants were randomized to an oral gel cap of ramelteon or placebo for 3 consecutive nights starting the night before surgery. Trained research staff conducted delirium assessments for 3 consecutive days starting on postoperative day (POD) 0, after recovery from anesthesia, and on to POD2. A delirium diagnosis was based upon DSM-5 criteria determined by expert panel consensus. RESULTS: Of 80 participants, five withdrew consent (one placebo, four ramelteon) and four were excluded (four ramelteon) after randomization. Delirium incidence during the 2 days following surgery was 7{\%} (5 of 71) with no difference between the ramelteon versus placebo: 9{\%} (3 of 33) and 5{\%} (2 of 38), respectively. The adjusted odds ratio for postoperative delirium as a function of assignment to the ramelteon treatment arm was 1.28 (95{\%} confidence interval: 0.21-7.93; z-value 0.27; p-value = 0.79). Adverse events were similar between the two groups. CONCLUSION: In older patients undergoing elective primary or revision hip or knee replacement, ramelteon was not efficacious in preventing postoperative delirium.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Propofol may help to protect against ischaemic acute kidney injury (AKI); however, research on this topic is sparse. OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to investigate whether there were differences in the incidence of postoperative AKI after lung resection surgery between patients who received propofol-based total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) and those who received sevoflurane-based inhalational anaesthesia. DESIGN: A retrospective observational study. SETTING: A single tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS: Medical records of patients aged 19 years or older who underwent curative lung resection surgery for nonsmall cell lung cancer between January 2005 and February 2018 were examined. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: After propensity score matching, the incidence of AKI in the first 3 postoperative days was compared between patients who received propofol and those who received sevoflurane. Logistic regression analyses were also used to investigate whether propofol-based TIVA lowered the risk of postoperative AKI. RESULTS: The analysis included 2872 patients (1477 in the sevoflurane group and 1395 in the propofol group). After propensity score matching, 661 patients were included in each group; 24 (3.6{\%}) of the 661 patients in the sevoflurane group developed AKI compared with 23 (3.5{\%}) of the 661 patients in the propofol group (95{\%} confidence intervals of difference in incidence -0.019 to 0.022, P = 0.882). The logistic regression analyses revealed that the incidence of AKI was not different in the two groups (odds ratio 0.96, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.53 to 1.71, P = 0.882). CONCLUSION: In this retrospective study, no significant difference was found in the incidence of postoperative AKI after lung resection surgery between patients who received propofol-based TIVA and those who received sevoflurane-based inhalational anaesthesia. Considering the methodological limitation of this retrospective study, further studies are required to confirm these results.},

@article{Olsson2014,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A common approach to decrease length of stay has been to standardize patient care, for example, by implementing clinical care pathways or creating fast-track organizations. In a recent national report, it was found that Sweden's healthcare system often fails to anticipate and respond to patients as individuals with particular needs, values and preferences. We compared a standardized care approach to one of person-centred care for patients undergoing total hip replacement surgery. METHODS: A control group (n =138) was consecutively recruited between 20th September 2010 and 1st March 2011 and an intervention group (n =128) between 12th December 2011 and 12th November 2012, both scheduled for total hip replacement. The primary outcome measures were length of stay and physical function at both discharge and 3 months later. RESULTS: The mean length of stay in the control group was 7 days (SD 5.0) compared to 5.3 days in the intervention group (SD 2.2). Physical functional performance, as assessed using activities of daily living, was similar at baseline for both groups. At discharge, 84{\%} in the control group had regained activities of daily living level A vs. 72{\%} in the intervention group. At 3 months after surgery, 88{\%} in the control group had regained their independence vs. 92.5{\%} in the person-centred care group. CONCLUSIONS: Focusing attention on patients as people and including them as partners in healthcare decision-making can result in shorter length of stay. The present study shows that the patients should be the focus and they should be involved as partners.},

@article{Ommundsen2018,
	abstract = {AIM: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is prevalent in the older population, and surgery is the mainstay of curative treatment. A preoperative geriatric assessment (GA) can identify frail older patients at risk for developing postoperative complications. In this randomized controlled trial we wanted to investigate whether tailored interventions based on a preoperative GA could reduce the frequency of postoperative complications in frail patients operated on for CRC. METHOD: Patients > 65 years scheduled for elective CRC surgery and fulfilling predefined criteria for frailty were randomized to either a preoperative GA followed by a tailored intervention or care as usual. The primary end-point was Clavien-Dindo Grade II-V postoperative complications. Secondary end-points included complications of any grade, reoperation, length of stay, readmission and survival. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-two patients with a mean age of 78.6 years were randomized. We found no statistically significant differences between the intervention group and the control group for Grade II-V complications (68{\%} vs 75{\%}, P = 0.43), reoperation (19{\%} vs 11{\%}, P = 0.24), length of stay (8 days in both groups), readmission (16{\%} vs 6{\%}, P = 0.12) or 30-day survival (4{\%} vs 5{\%}, P = 0.79). Grade I-V complications occurred in 76{\%} of patients in the intervention group compared with 87{\%} in the control group (P = 0.10). In secondary analyses adjusting for prespecified prognostic factors, there was a statistically significant difference in favour of the intervention for reducing the total number of Grade I-V complications (P = 0.05). CONCLUSION: A preoperative GA and tailored interventions did not reduce the rate of Grade II-V complications, reoperations, readmission or mortality in frail older patients electively operated on for CRC.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We aim to compare selective spinal anesthesia and general anesthesia with regard to postoperative recovery and fast-track eligibility in day surgeries. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Sixty geriatric outpatient cases, with ASA II-III physical status and requiring short-duration transurethral intervention, were enrolled in the study. The cases were split into 2 groups: as general anesthesia (Group GA) and selective spinal anesthesia (Group SSA). Group GA (n = 30) received propofol 2 mg kg⁻¹(until loss of eyelash reflex), remifentanil induction 0.5-1 µg kg⁻¹, and laryngeal mask. Maintenance was achieved by 4-6{\%} desflurane in 60{\%} N₂O and 40{\%} O₂along with remifentanil infusion at 0.05 µg /kg⁻¹/min⁻¹. Drugs were discontinued after the withdrawal of the ureteroscope, and extubation was carried out with 100{\%} O₂. Group SSA (n = 30) received 0.5{\%} spinal anesthesia via L4-5 space by 0.5{\%} hyperbaric bupivacaine 5 mg. Anesthesia preparation time, time to surgical anesthesia level, postoperative fast-tracking, and time to White-Song recovery score of 12, were noted. In the operating room, we evaluated hemodynamics, nausea/vomiting, surgeon and patient satisfaction with anesthesia, perioperative midazolam-fentanyl administration, postoperative pain, and discharge time. RESULTS: Anesthesia preparation time, length of surgery, anesthesia-related time in the operating room, time to sit, and time to walk were significantly low in Group GA (p < 0.05), whereas time to fast-track eligibility, length of stay in the PACU, discharge time, and other parameters were similar in both of the groups. CONCLUSION: While anesthesia preparation time, length of surgery, start time of surgery, time to sit, and time to walk were shorter in the General Anesthesia group, time to fast-track eligibility, phase 1 recovery time, and discharge time were similar among patients subjected to selective spinal anesthesia.},

@article{Ottens2014,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiac surgery can be complicated by postoperative cognitive decline (POCD), which is characterized by impaired memory function and intellectual ability. The systemic inflammatory response that is induced by major surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass may play an important role in the etiology of POCD. Prophylactic corticosteroids to attenuate the inflammatory response may therefore reduce the risk of POCD. The authors investigated the effect of intraoperative high-dose dexamethasone on the incidence of POCD at 1 month and 12 months after cardiac surgery. METHODS: This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is a preplanned substudy of the DExamethasone for Cardiac Surgery trial. A total of 291 adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were recruited in three hospitals and randomized to receive dexamethasone 1 mg/kg (n = 145) or placebo (n = 146). The main outcome measures were incidence of POCD at 1- and 12-month follow-up, defined as a decline in neuropsychological test performance beyond natural variability, as measured in a control group. RESULTS: At 1-month follow-up, 19 of 140 patients in the dexamethasone group (13.6{\%}) and 10 of 138 patients in the placebo group (7.2{\%}) fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for POCD (relative risk, 1.87; 95{\%} CI, 0.90 to 3.88; P = 0.09). At 12-month follow-up, 8 of 115 patients in the dexamethasone group (7.0{\%}) and 4 of 114 patients (3.5{\%}) in the placebo group had POCD (relative risk, 1.98; 95{\%} CI, 0.61 to 6.40; P = 0.24). CONCLUSION: Intraoperative high-dose dexamethasone did not reduce the risk of POCD after cardiac surgery.},

Patients undergoing off-pump CABG surgery performed by a surgeon were randomly assigned into two groups, including total intravenous anesthesia (group TIVA, n=40; mean age 66$\pm$4) or inhalational anesthesia (group IA, n=40; mean age 69$\pm$3). The effect of off-pump CABG surgery on mental outcome was assessed with S100 protein, a neurochemical marker of brain injury under ischemic conditions. Comparison of mental function before and after off-pump CABG surgery, hemodynamic stability and time to discharge were the main outcomes of the study. Results: Hemodynamic values were stable in both groups. None of the patients showed marked increase in serum concentrations of S100 postoperatively (p<0.001). The mean total off-pump CABG time was 48$\pm$15 minutes in both groups. There was no difference between the groups in terms of time to discharge. Conclusion: We believe that well-performed hemodynamic stability with either intravenous or general anesthesia may offer a well-controlled mental function in elderly patients undergoing offpump CABG surgery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Postoperative confusion and delirium is a common complication in the elderly with a poorly understood pathophysiology. The aim of this study was to examine whether the type of anaesthesia (general or regional) plays a role in the development of cognitive impairment in elderly patients during the immediate postoperative period. METHODS: Forty-seven patients > 60 yr of age and undergoing major surgery were randomly allocated to receive either regional or general anaesthesia. The mental status of the patients was assessed preoperatively and during the first three postoperative days with the Mini Mental State Examination. The incidence of delirium was also examined during the same period with the use of DSM III criteria. RESULTS: Overall, during the first three postoperative days, the mean Mini Mental State Examination score decreased significantly (P < 0.001). However, this decline was very significant only in patients assigned to receive general anaesthesia (P < 0.001) compared to regional anaesthesia. Nine patients developed delirium but the type of anaesthesia did not affect its incidence. The only important factor for the development of delirium was preexisting cardiovascular disease irrespective of anaesthesia type (P < 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients subjected to general anaesthesia displayed more frequent cognitive impairment during the immediate postoperative period in comparison to those who received a regional technique.},

	abstract = {We evaluated whether volatile anesthetics can improve the postoperative outcomes of non-cardiac surgery in patients with preoperative myocardial injury defined by the cardiac troponin elevation. From January 2010 to June 2018, 1254 adult patients with preoperative myocardial injury underwent non-cardiac surgery under general anesthesia and were enrolled in this study. Patients were stratified into following two groups according to anesthetic agents; 115 (9.2{\%}) patients whose anesthesia was induced and maintained with continuous infusion of propofol and remifentanil (TIVA group) and 1139 (90.8{\%}) patients whose anesthesia was maintainted with volatile anesthetics (VOLATILE group). The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. To diminish the remifentanil effect, a further analysis was conducted after excluding the patients who received only volatile anesthetics without remifentanil infusion. In a propensity-score matched analysis, 30-day mortality was higher in the TIVA group than the VOLATILE group (17.0{\%} vs. 9.1{\%}; hazard ratio {$[$}HR{$]$} 2.60; 95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$}, 1.14-5.93; p = 0.02). In addition, the TIVA group showed higher 30-day mortality than the VOLATILE group, even after eliminating the effect of remifentanil infusion (15.8{\%} vs. 8.3{\%}; HR 4.62; 95{\%} CI, 1.82-11.74; p = 0.001). In our study, the use of volatile anesthetics showed the significant survival improvement after non-cardiac surgery in patients with preoperative myocardial injury, which appears to be irrelevant to the remifentanil use. Further studies are needed to confirm this beneficial effect of volatile anesthetics. Clinical trial number and registry URL: KCT0004349 (www.cris.nih.go.kr).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increasing numbers of older patients are undergoing vascular surgery. Inadequate preoperative assessment and optimization may contribute to increased postoperative morbidity and mortality. METHODS: Patients aged at least 65 years scheduled for elective aortic aneurysm repair or lower-limb arterial surgery were enrolled in an RCT of standard preoperative assessment or preoperative comprehensive geriatric assessment and optimization. Randomization was stratified by sex and surgical site (aorta/lower limb). Primary outcome was length of hospital stay. Secondary outcome measures included new medical co-morbidities, postoperative medical or surgical complications, discharge to a higher level of dependency and 30-day readmission rate. RESULTS: A total of 176 patients were included in the final analysis (control 91, intervention 85). Geometric mean length of stay was 5.53 days in the control group and 3.32 days in the intervention group (ratio of geometric means 0.60, 95 per cent c.i. 0.46 to 0.79; P < 0.001). There was a lower incidence of delirium (11 versus 24 per cent; P = 0.018), cardiac complications (8 versus 27 per cent; P = 0.001) and bladder/bowel complications (33 versus 55 per cent; P = 0.003) in the intervention group compared with the control group. Patients in the intervention group were less likely to require discharge to a higher level of dependency (4 of 85 versus 12 of 91; P = 0.051). CONCLUSION: In this study of patients aged 65 years or older undergoing vascular surgery, preoperative comprehensive geriatric assessment was associated with a shorter length of hospital stay. Patients undergoing assessment and optimization had a lower incidence of complications and were less likely to be discharged to a higher level of dependency.

	abstract = {This randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study was primarily aimed to evaluate the potential of risperidone to prevent postoperative delirium following cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass and the secondary objective was to explore clinical factors associated with postoperative delirium. One-hundred-and-twenty-six adult patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were randomly assigned to receive either 1 mg of risperidone or placebo sublingually when they regained consciousness. Delirium and other outcomes were assessed. The confusion assessment method for intensive care unit was used to assess postoperative delirium. The incidence of postoperative delirium in the risperidone group was lower than the placebo group (11.1{\%} vs. 31.7{\%} respectively, P=0.009, relative risk = 0.35, 95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$} = 0.16-0.77). Other postoperative outcomes were not statistically different between the groups. In exploring the factors associated with delirium, univariate analysis showed many factors were associated with postoperative delirium. However multiple logistic regression analysis showed a lapse of 70 minutes from the time of opening eyes to following commands and postoperative respiratory failure were independent risk factors (P=0.003, odds ratio {$[$}OR{$]$} = 4.57, 95{\%} CI = 1.66-12.59 and P=0.038, OR = 13.78, 95{\%} CI = 1.15-165.18 respectively). A single dose of risperidone administered soon after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass reduces the incidence of postoperative delirium. Multiple factors tended to be associated with postoperative delirium, but only the time from opening eyes to following commands and postoperative respiratory failure were independent risk factors in this study.},

@article{Prestmo2015,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most patients with hip fractures are characterised by older age (>70 years), frailty, and functional deterioration, and their long-term outcomes are poor with increased costs. We compared the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of giving these patients comprehensive geriatric care in a dedicated geriatric ward versus the usual orthopaedic care. METHODS: We did a prospective, single-centre, randomised, parallel-group, controlled trial. Between April 18, 2008, and Dec 30, 2010, we randomly assigned home-dwelling patients with hip-fractures aged 70 years or older who were able to walk 10 m before their fracture, to either comprehensive geriatric care or orthopaedic care in the emergency department, to achieve the required sample of 400 patients. Randomisation was achieved via a web-based, computer-generated, block method with unknown block sizes. The primary outcome, analysed by intention to treat, was mobility measured with the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) 4 months after surgery for the fracture. The type of treatment was not concealed from the patients or staff delivering the care, and assessors were only partly masked to the treatment during follow-up. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00667914. FINDINGS: We assessed 1077 patients for eligibility, and excluded 680, mainly for not meeting the inclusion criteria such as living in a nursing home or being aged less than 70 years. Of the remaining patients, we randomly assigned 198 to comprehensive geriatric care and 199 to orthopaedic care. At 4 months, 174 patients remained in the comprehensive geriatric care group and 170 in the orthopaedic care group; the main reason for dropout was death. Mean SPPB scores at 4 months were 5·12 (SE 0·20) for comprehensive geriatric care and 4·38 (SE 0·20) for orthopaedic care (between-group difference 0·74, 95{\%} CI 0·18-1·30, p=0·010). INTERPRETATION: Immediate admission of patients aged 70 years or more with a hip fracture to comprehensive geriatric care in a dedicated ward improved mobility at 4 months, compared with the usual orthopaedic care. The results suggest that the treatment of older patients with hip fractures should be organised as orthogeriatric care.

@article{Purwar2015,
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Spinal anaesthesia (SA) and general anaesthesia (GA) are widely used techniques for vaginal surgery for pelvic floor disorders with inconclusive evidence of the superiority of either. We conducted a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to assess the feasibility of a full scale RCT aiming to examine the effect of anaesthetic mode for vaginal surgery on operative, patient reported and length of hospital stay (LOHS) outcomes. METHODS: Patients undergoing vaginal surgery, recruited through a urogynaecology service in a University teaching hospital, were randomised to receive either GA or SA. Patients were followed up for 12 weeks postoperatively. Pain was measured on a visual analogue scale; nausea was assessed with a four-point verbal rating scale. Patient's subjective perception of treatment outcome, quality of life (QoL) and functional outcomes were assessed using the International Consultation on Incontinence Modular Questionnaire (ICIQ) on vaginal symptoms and the SF-36 questionnaire. RESULTS: Sixty women were randomised, 29 to GA and 31 to SA. The groups were similar in terms of age and type of vaginal surgery performed. No statistically significant differences were noted between the groups with regard to pain, nausea, quality of life (QoL), functional outcomes as well as length of stay in the postoperative recovery room, use of analgesia postoperatively and LOHS. CONCLUSION: This study has demonstrated that a full RCT is feasible and should focus on the length of hospital stay in a subgroup of patients undergoing vaginal surgery where SA may help to facilitate enhanced recovery or day surgery.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The effects of general anesthetics on cognitive impairment are unclear and complicated. Laser laryngeal surgery (LLS) requires the administration of low levels of oxygen, which may increase the risk of desaturation and brain function impairment. This prospective randomized trial aimed to compare the effects of desflurane and propofol-based general anesthesia on the occurrence of early postoperative cognitive decline in elderly patients undergoing LLS. METHODS: Seventy-three patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists grade I or II and at least 65 years of age were randomly allocated to receive either desflurane-based (Group D) or propofol-based (Group P) anesthesia during LLS. The standard anesthesia protocol was performed, with a bispectral index between 40 and 60 and a mean arterial pressure within 20{\%} of baseline values. Intraoperative regional oxygen saturation values were recorded. Each patient was assessed using the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) test during the preoperative period (baseline), 30 min after extubation in the postanesthesia care unit, and 1, 3, and 24 h after surgery. RESULTS: MMSE scores improved slightly in both groups compared to baseline during the early postoperative period, but these increases were not statistically significant. No significant differences were identified in MMSE scores between groups. Only three patients (9.6{\%}) in group D and one patient (3.1{\%}) in group P developed cognitive impairment (p = 0.583). CONCLUSION: Low intraoperative inspired oxygen concentration during short-duration LLS did not reduce early postoperative cognitive function in elderly patients. Desflurane or propofol-based anesthesia had similar effects on early neurocognition after LLS. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2 Laryngoscope, 133:640-646, 2023.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Elderly patients are reportedly at higher risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) after inhalational anesthesia with sevoflurane. We hypothesized that the incidence of POCD would be higher in elderly patients undergoing major surgery under inhalational rather than intravenous anesthesia. We also measured plasma S-100βprotein concentration as a biomarker of central nervous system injury, and plasma interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-αconcentrations to judge the contribution of systemic inflammation to POCD. METHODS: Ninety patients aged 65-75 years scheduled for resection of an esophageal carcinoma were randomly assigned to one of three groups (n = 30) as follows: a group receiving sevoflurane anesthesia (Group S); a group receiving preoperative methylprednisolone before sevoflurane anesthesia (Group S + MP); and a control group maintained with intravenous propofol (Group C). The mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) were used to measure patients' cognitive function the day before surgery, and on the first, third and seventh postoperative days. The plasma concentrations of TNF-α, IL-6 and S-100βprotein were measured 10 min before anesthesia, and on the first, third and seventh postoperative days. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the demographic or clinical characteristics, or perioperative hemodynamic status, of the three groups. The MMSE and MoCA scores were significantly lower in Group S than in the propofol control (Group C) and Group S + MP on the first, third and seventh postoperative days (P <0.05). Throughout the first postoperative week the plasma concentrations of TNF-α, IL-6, and S-100βprotein were significantly elevated in Group S compared with Group C (P <0.05), but were significantly lower in Group S + MP than Group S (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of POCD was higher in elderly patients undergoing major surgery under inhalational anesthesia with sevoflurane than those maintained on intravenous propofol, and lower in elderly patients pro-treating with methylprednisolone. Furthermore, we found elevated plasma concentrations of S-100βprotein, TNF-αand IL-6 in those receiving sevoflurane anesthesia. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ChiCTR-IOR-15007007 (02-09-2015).},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of sustained inhalation of sevoflurane on cognitive function and the expression of oxidative stress response proteins such as NADPH oxidase subunits NOX2 and NOX4 in elderly patients undergoing radical surgery for lung cancer. STUDY DESIGN: An experimental study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Anesthesiology, Suzhou Kowloon Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, China, from February 2016 to October 2017. METHODOLOGY: Elderly patients who underwent radical surgery for lung cancer were divided into the sevoflurane group and the propofol group, with 52 cases in each group. Sustained inhalation of sevoflurane and propofol was administered to maintain anesthesia in the respective groups. Cognitive function and lung function parameters were compared between the two groups. Serum S100 {$\beta$} levels and expression of NOX2 and NOX4 proteins in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the two groups were determined. RESULTS: At 24 hours after surgery, the lung function indices of the sevoflurane group such as FEV1, FVC and VC were higher than those of the propofol group (p<0.001, p=0.008 and p=0.002, respectively). At the end of the surgery and at 24 hours after surgery, the MMSE scores of the sevoflurane group were higher than the propofol group (all p<0.001). S100levels were lower than the propofol group (p=0.003 and p<0.001, respectively). Levels of NADPH oxidase subunits NOX2 and NOX4 proteins in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the sevoflurane group were lower than the propofol group (p=0.033, p<0.001, p<0.001and p<0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Compared with intravenous anesthesia with propofol, general anesthesia with sevoflurane inhalation has little effect on the short-term cognitive function in elderly patients undergoing radical surgery for lung cancer, and can effectively improve lung function. The mechanism may be related to the reduction of the expression of NOX2 and NOX4 proteins.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The delirium-sparing effect of nighttime dexmedetomidine has not been studied after surgery. We hypothesised that a nighttime dose of dexmedetomidine would reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium as compared to placebo. METHODS: This single-centre, parallel-arm, randomised, placebo-controlled superiority trial evaluated whether a short nighttime dose of intravenous dexmedetomidine (1 μg/kg over 40 min) would reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium in patients 60 years of age or older undergoing elective cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients were randomised to receive dexmedetomidine or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome was delirium on postoperative day one. Secondary outcomes included delirium within three days of surgery, 30-, 90-, and 180-day abbreviated Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores, Patient Reported Outcome Measures Information System quality of life scores, and all-cause mortality. The study was registered as NCT02856594 on ClinicalTrials.gov on August 5, 2016, before the enrolment of any participants. FINDINGS: Of 469 patients that underwent randomisation to placebo (n = 235) or dexmedetomidine (n = 234), 75 met a prespecified drop criterion before the study intervention. Thus, 394 participants (188 dexmedetomidine; 206 placebo) were analysed in the modified intention-to-treat cohort (median age 69 {$[$}IQR 64, 74{$]$} years; 73.1{\%} male {$[$}n = 288{$]$}; 26·9{\%} female {$[$}n = 106{$]$}). Postoperative delirium status on day one was missing for 30 (7.6{\%}) patients. Among those in whom it could be assessed, the primary outcome occurred in 5 of 175 patients (2.9{\%}) in the dexmedetomidine group and 16 of 189 patients (8.5{\%}) in the placebo group (OR 0.32, 95{\%} CI: 0.10-0.83; P = 0.029). A non-significant but higher proportion of participants experienced delirium within three days postoperatively in the placebo group (25/177; 14.1{\%}) compared to the dexmedetomidine group (14/160; 8.8{\%}; OR 0.58; 95{\%} CI, 0.28-1.15). No significant differences between groups were observed in secondary outcomes or safety. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggested that in elderly cardiac surgery patients with a low baseline risk of postoperative delirium and extubated within 12 h of ICU admission, a short nighttime dose of dexmedetomidine decreased the incidence of delirium on postoperative day one. Although non-statistically significant, our findings also suggested a clinical meaningful difference in the three-day incidence of postoperative delirium.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute postoperative cognitive dysfunction is characterized by neurocognitive dysfunction and confusion. In this study, we compared the cognitive status of a geriatric population undergoing ophthalmic surgery, as assessed by the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) before and after ketamine administration. METHODS: Eighty patients were enrolled and randomly assigned in a double-blind study to receive either ketamine (0.3 mg/kg dose) or physiologic solution (control group). Sixty-five (control, n = 32; ketamine, n = 33) patients completed the trial. Cognitive performance was assessed with an abbreviated version of the SPMSQ. Measurements of analgesia, sedation, intraocular pressure, and hemodynamic variables were recorded. RESULTS: With respect to cognitive performance, the baseline evaluation was similar for the control and ketamine groups. Postoperative evaluation showed an improvement only in the ketamine group. No increase in intraocular pressure or a secondary nystagmus was observed. The average dose of midazolam was higher in the control group, but the difference was not clinically significant. After surgery, analgesic behavior was better in the ketamine group than in the control group. There were no differences between groups in the sedation scale or in hemodynamic variables. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of 0.3 mg/kg ketamine during ophthalmic surgery in geriatric patients changed their cognitive status as assessed by the SPMSQ, decreased the required dose of anesthetics, and produced no increase in intraocular pressure or in hemodynamic variables. However, because the evaluation only analyzed the immediate effects of the administered drug, further research will be required to examine the impact of ketamine on the postoperative cognitive performance of geriatric patients before the drug can be formally recommended for this purpose.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common complication after cardiac and major non-cardiac surgery with general anaesthesia in the elderly. We hypothesized that the incidence of POCD would be less with regional anaesthesia rather than general. METHODS: We included patients aged over 60 years undergoing major non-cardiac surgery. After giving written informed consent, patients were randomly allocated to general or regional anaesthesia. Cognitive function was assessed using four neuropsychological tests undertaken preoperatively and at 7 days and 3 months postoperatively. POCD was defined as a combined Z score >1.96 or a Z score >1.96 in two or more test parameters. RESULTS: At 7 days, POCD was found in 37/188 patients (19.7{\%}, {$[$}14.3-26.1{\%}{$]$}) after general anaesthesia and in 22/176 (12.5{\%}, {$[$}8.0-18.3{\%}{$]$}) after regional anaesthesia, P = 0.06. After 3 months, POCD was present in 25/175 patients (14.3{\%}, {$[$}9.5-20.4{\%}{$]$}) after general anaesthesia vs. 23/165 (13.9{\%}, {$[$}9.0-20.2{\%}{$]$}) after regional anaesthesia, P = 0.93. The incidence of POCD after 1 week was significantly greater after general anaesthesia when we excluded patients who did not receive the allocated anaesthetic: 33/156 (21.2{\%}{$[$}15.0-28.4{\%}{$]$}) vs. 20/158 (12.7{\%}{$[$}7.9-18.9{\%}{$]$}) (P = 0.04). Mortality was significantly greater after general anaesthesia (4/217 vs. 0/211 (P < 0.05)). CONCLUSION: No significant difference was found in the incidence of cognitive dysfunction 3 months after either general or regional anaesthesia in elderly patients. Thus, there seems to be no causative relationship between general anaesthesia and long-term POCD. Regional anaesthesia may decrease mortality and the incidence of POCD early after surgery.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To investigate the effect of general and subarachnoid (spinal) anesthesia on the incidence of postoperative delirium and cognitive impairments in elderly Chinese patients. Methods: Elderly Chinese patients (n = 281) aged 65 - 79 years (mean age = 74.12 $\pm$4.15 years) who underwent proximal femoral fracture surgery were recruited over a 1-year period for this study. The patients were evaluated using neuropsychological assessment battery (NAB) 24 h before surgery, and on the first day 1 month after surgery. Data on activity of daily living (ADL) (in this case toileting at the time of discharge) were recorded and analyzed. Results: There was no significant difference in the number of patients that developed postoperative delirium between the two anesthesia groups (p > 0.05). Although the trail making test (TMT) scores (parts A and B) were increased on the first day 1 month after surgery, there were no significant differences in NAB results between the two groups (p > 0.05). Patients who received subarachnoid (spinal) anesthesia had significantly higher dependency for toileting at the time of discharge than those who received general anesthesia (p < 0.05). Conclusion: These results show that general and subarachnoid (spinal) anesthesia do not cause postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction in elderly Chinese patients who underwent proximal femoral fracture surgery.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine whether knowledge of deficits obtained in a preoperative geriatric assessment may benefit postoperative health outcomes in older women undergoing pelvic surgery. METHODS: This study employed a pre-post intervention cohort design. Primary outcome was difference in scores of the Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 Health Survey in 62 older women who had undergone "usual" compared with an "enhanced" preoperative assessment consisting of Activities of Daily Living, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, Get Up and Go Test, Draw a Clock Test, Mini Nutritional Assessment, Geriatric Depression Scale, and Social Support Scale. The assessment results were placed on the participant's hospital chart. Repeated measures analysis was used. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in Mental Component Summary scores between the usual and enhanced assessment cohorts preoperatively (mean +/- standard deviation; 49.14 +/- 10.61 compared with 53.2 +/- 9.33), at 6 weeks (53.69 +/- 8.61 compared with 55.47 +/- 9.46), or at 6 months postoperatively (53.85 +/- 10.77 compared with 56.25 +/- 7.25); P = .120 for group effect and P = .798 for group by time interaction. Significant time effect was noted (P = .036). There was no significant difference in Physical Component Summary scores between the usual and enhanced assessment cohorts with respect to group effect (P = .986); there was a significant time effect (P = < .001) and a significant group by time interaction (P = .026). Satisfaction with treatment was high in both cohorts at 6 weeks and 6 months. CONCLUSION: A preoperative geriatric assessment did not seem to have differential benefit in healthy older women undergoing elective pelvic floor surgery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II-2.},

@article{Rohan2005,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is evident in 26{\%} of elderly patients seven days after major non-cardiac surgery. Despite the growing popularity of day surgery, the influence of anesthetic techniques on next day POCD has not been investigated. Therefore, we evaluated the incidence of POCD and changes in serum markers of neuronal damage (S-100ss protein and Neuron-Specific Enolase), 24 hr after single-agent propofol or sevoflurane anesthesia in elderly patients undergoing minor surgery. METHODS: Patients (n = 30, mean age 73, range 65-86 yr) coming for cystoscopy or hysteroscopy, were randomized, in an observer-blind design, to receive either single-agent propofol or sevoflurane anesthesia. Changes in neuropsychological tests (the Stroop test and the modified Word-Recall Test), 24 hr postoperatively were compared with age-matched control subjects (n = 15) using Z-score analysis. Changes in S-100beta protein and Neuron-Specific Enolase levels were also documented. RESULTS: POCD was present in 7/15 {$[$}47{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 21 to 72{\%}){$]$} patients who received propofol and 7/15 {$[$}47{\%} (95{\%} CI 21 to 72{\%}){$]$} patients who received sevoflurane, compared with 1/15 {$[$}7{\%} (95{\%} CI 6 to 19{\%}){$]$} control patients, P = 0.03. S-100beta protein and Neuron-Specific Enolase levels were not significantly different in anesthetized patients postoperatively compared with preoperative values. CONCLUSION: The incidence of POCD in elderly patients on the first day after minor surgery is higher than previously reported for seven days after major surgery, and is increased after both propofol and sevoflurane anesthesia, compared with age-matched controls. S-100beta protein and Neuron-Specific Enolase levels were unaffected by anesthetic technique.},

	abstract = {Fast-track surgery is a multimodal evidence-based approach to perioperative care aimed at reducing complications and recovery time. We compared a fast-track protocol to standard care in the setting of a small Italian general hospital. Propensity score estimation before and after the study was performed to compare pre-fast-track (pre-FT; January 2013--March 2014) and fast-track (FT; January 2016--December 2016) patients undergoing elective hip and knee replacement surgery with a three-year follow-up (up to January 2020). The primary endpoints were the mean hemoglobin drop, mean predischarge hemoglobin, transfusion and reinfusion rates, pain, ambulation day, hospital length of stay (LOS), and discharge to home/outpatient care or rehabilitation hospital center. The secondary endpoints were the adherence measures to the FT protocol, namely, tourniquet and surgical times, use of drains and catheters, type of anesthesia administered, and complications within three years. The risk difference (RD) and the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) were calculated for each outcome. After the propensity score estimation, we analyzed 59 patients in the pre-FT and 122 in the FT categories. The FT patients, with respect to the pre-FT patients, ameliorated their mean hemoglobin drop from 3.7 to 3.1 g/dl (p < 0.01) and improved their predischarge mean hemoglobin (10.5 g/dL versus 11.0 g/dL; p = 0.01). Furthermore, the aOR of being transfused was reduced by 81{\%} (p < 0,01); the RD of being reinfused was reduced by 63{\%} (p < 0.01); the aOR of having low pain on the first day was increased by more than six times (p < 0.01); the RD of ambulating the first day increased by 91{\%} (p < 0.01); the aOR of admission to a rehabilitation hospital center was reduced by 98{\%} (p < 0.01); the aOR of home discharge increased by 42 times (p < 0.01); the median LOS, tourniquet and surgical times, and use of catheters and drains significantly decreased. Patients with complications at 1 month were 43.1{\%} and 38.2{\%}, respectively, of pre-FT and FT patients (p = 0.63). Complications at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months were significantly lower for the FT patients. This study showed that the uptake of enhanced recovery practices was successful and resulted in the improvement of clinical and organizational outcomes. The fast-track concept and related programs may optimize perioperative care and streamline surgical and rehabilitation care paths.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammation after cardiopulmonary bypass may contribute to postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction. The authors evaluated the effect of high-dose methylprednisolone to suppress inflammation on the incidence of delirium and postoperative quality of recovery after cardiac surgery. METHODS: Five hundred fifty-five adults from three hospitals enrolled in the randomized, double-blind Steroids in Cardiac Surgery trial were randomly allocated to placebo or 250 mg methylprednisolone at induction and 250 mg methylprednisolone before cardiopulmonary bypass. Each completed the Postoperative Quality of Recovery Scale before surgery and on days 1, 2, and 3 and 1 and 6 months after surgery and the Confusion Assessment Method scale for delirium on days 1, 2, and 3. Recovery was defined as returning to preoperative values or improvement at each time point. RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-two participants for recovery and 498 participants for delirium were available for analysis. The quality of recovery improved over time but without differences between groups in the primary endpoint of overall recovery (odds ratio range over individual time points for methylprednisolone, 0.39 to 1.45; 95{\%} CI, 0.08-2.04 to 0.40-5.27; P = 0.943) or individual recovery domains (all P > 0.05). The incidence of delirium was 10{\%} (control) versus 8{\%} (methylprednisolone; P = 0.357), with no differences in delirium subdomains (all P > 0.05). In participants with normal (51{\%}) and low baseline cognition (49{\%}), there were no significant differences favoring methylprednisolone in any domain (all P > 0.05). Recovery was worse in patients with postoperative delirium in the cognitive (P = 0.004) and physiologic (P < 0.001) domains. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose intraoperative methylprednisolone neither reduces delirium nor improves the quality of recovery in high-risk cardiac surgical patients.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of general anesthesia (GA) versus spinal anesthesia (SpA) on intraoperative and postoperative outcome in patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy. METHODS: Seventy-two consecutive patients with clinically localized prostate cancer were randomized into group 1 (GA: 34 patients) or group 2 (L2-L3 or L3-L4 SpA: 38 patients) and underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy. The intraoperative and postoperative anesthetic and surgical variables were evaluated. RESULTS: The mean +/- SEM operative time was not significantly different between the two groups (P = 0.43). The overall blood loss was less in group 2 (P = 0.04). The mean +/- SEM postoperative time in the postoperative holding area was significantly shorter after SpA than after GA (P <0.0001). The perioperative pain outcome in the postoperative holding area was significantly better for group 2 than for group 1 (P = 0.0017), but postoperative pain on day 1 was not significantly different between the two groups. The postoperative sedation score was significantly less in group 2 than in group 1 (P <0.0001). On day 1, first flatus passed in a significantly larger number of patients in group 2 (P <0.0001), and the overall gait was greater for group 2 patients (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that SpA allows good muscle relaxation and a successful surgical outcome in patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer. Moreover, SpA results in less intraoperative blood loss, less postoperative pain, and a faster postoperative recovery than GA.},

	abstract = {AIM: To assess the impact of spinal anesthesia (SpA) combined with three different forms of conscious sedation on intraoperative and postoperative outcome in patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) for organ confined prostate cancer (pCa). METHODS: A total of 121 consecutive patients with pCa undergoing RRP were randomized into four groups. They were randomized as follows: group 1 (general anesthesia: 34 patients), group 2 (lumbar 2 to lumbar 3 interspace SpA with diazepam as sedative agent: 28), group 3 (SpA with propofol: 30), and group 4 (SpA with midazolam: 29). Intraoperative and perioperative parameters were collected. RESULTS: The present study showed that muscle relaxation throughout RRP was not different in the four groups; bleeding was significantly (P = 0.04) lower with SpA, regardless of the form of sedation. Group 3 patients reported the best postoperative oxygen saturation percentage by pulse oximetry and sedation score (P = 0.02; d.f. = 3 and P < 0.0001; d.f. = 3, respectively), the shortest waiting time in the postoperative holding area (P < 0.001; d.f. = 3), the lowest pain on postoperative day 1 (P = 0.0004; d.f. = 3), and the highest frequency of first flatus passage (P = 0.0001; d.f. = 3). A higher number of group 4 patients were able to carry out unassisted ambulation (P < 0.0001; d.f. = 3). CONCLUSIONS: Conscious sedation coupled with SpA is a safe, reliable and effective procedure for patients undergoing RRP. The use of propofol as sedative agent offers several advantages both over other types of conscious sedation and general anesthesia.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delirium is common after cardiac surgery and may be partly related to the systemic inflammatory response triggered by the surgery and the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. We hypothesized that intraoperative administration of high-dose dexamethasone, a drug with potent anti-inflammatory effects, would reduce the incidence of delirium at any time point during the first 4 postoperative days after cardiac surgery. METHODS: This was a single-center substudy within a larger, multicenter placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial, the Dexamethasone for Cardiac Surgery (DECS) trial that randomized patients >/=18 years, undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, to receive, in a double-blind fashion, either dexamethasone 1 mg/kg or placebo at the induction of anesthesia. Over the first 4 postoperative days, we compared between groups the incidence of delirium (based on the Confusion Assessment Method adapted for the intensive care unit, or after intensive care unit discharge, by the Confusion Assessment Method, accompanied by chart review), restraint use, and administered haloperidol, benzodiazepines, and opioids. Data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. The proportion of patients with delirium in the dexamethasone versus the placebo group was compared using the odds ratio (OR) with a 95{\%} confidence interval (CI). The proportion also was compared using logistic regression to adjust for common baseline variables that might confound the presence of delirium between the 2 groups. RESULTS: Of 768 eligible patients, 737 subjects (96.0{\%}) had complete data. The incidence of delirium was similar between the dexamethasone (14.2{\%}) and placebo (14.9{\%}) groups (crude OR = 0.95, 95{\%} CI, 0.63-1.43; adjusted OR = 0.85, 95{\%} CI, 0.55-1.31). Among patients who developed delirium, the median (interquartile range) duration of delirium was similar between the dexamethasone and placebo groups (2 {$[$}1-3{$]$} vs 2 {$[$}1-2{$]$} days, respectively, P = 0.45; WMWodds 0.98, 95{\%} CI, 0.83-1.17). Restraint use and the administration of haloperidol, benzodiazepines, and opioids were also similar between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: The intraoperative administration of dexamethasone did not reduce the incidence or duration of delirium in the first 4 days after cardiac surgery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Supraclavicular block (SCB) with long-acting local anaesthetic is commonly used for surgical repair of distal radial fractures (DRF). Studies have shown a risk for rebound pain when the block fades. This randomised single-centre study aimed to compare pain and opioid consumption the first three days post-surgery between SCB-mepivacaine vs. SCB-ropivacaine, with general anaesthesia (GA) as control. METHODS: Patients (n = 90) with ASA physical status 1-3 were prospectively randomised to receive; SCB with mepivacine 1{\%}, 25-30 ml (n = 30), SCB with ropivacaine 0.5{\%}, 25-30 ml (n = 30) or GA (n = 30) with propofol/fentanyl/sevoflurane. Study objectives compared postoperative pain with Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) and sum postoperative Opioid Equivalent Consumption (OEC) during the first 3 days post-surgery between study-groups. RESULTS: The three groups showed significant differences in postoperative pain-profile. Mean NRS at 24 h was significantly lower for the SCB-mepivacaine group (p = 0.018). Further both median NRS and median OEC day 0 to 3 were significanly lower in the SCB-mepivacaine group as compared to the SCB-ropivacaine group during the first three days after surgery; pain NRS 1 (IQR 0.3-3.3) and 2.7 (IQR 1.3-4.2) (p = 0.017) and OEC 30 mg (IQR 10-80) and 85 mg (IQR 45-125) (p = 0.004), respectively. The GA-group was in between both in pain NRS and median sum OEC. Unplanned healthcare contacts were highest among SCB-ropivacaine patients (39.3{\%}) vs. SCB-mepivacaine patients (0{\%}) and GA-patients (3.4{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: The potential benefit of longer duration of analgesia, associated to a long-acting local anaesthetic agent, during the early postoperative course must be put in perspective of potential worse pain progression following block resolution.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Commonly used sedatives/analgesics can increase the risk of postoperative complications, including delirium. This double-blinded study assessed the neurobehavioral, hemodynamic, and sedative characteristics of dexmedetomidine compared with morphine-based regimen after cardiac surgery at equivalent levels of sedation and analgesia. METHODS: A total of 306 patients at least 60 yr old were randomized to receive dexmedetomidine (0.1-0.7 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1)) or morphine (10-70 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1)) with open-label propofol titrated to a target Motor Activity Assessment Scale of 2-4. Primary outcome was the prevalence of delirium measured daily via Confusion Assessment Method for intensive care. Secondary outcomes included ventilation time, additional sedation/analgesia, and hemodynamic and adverse effects. RESULTS: Of all sedation assessments, 75.2{\%} of dexmedetomidine and 79.6{\%} (P = 0.516) of morphine treatment were in the target range. Delirium incidence was comparable between dexmedetomidine 13 (8.6{\%}) and morphine 22 (15.0{\%}) (relative risk 0.571, 95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$} 0.256-1.099, P = 0.088), however, dexmedetomidine-managed patients spent 3 fewer days (2 {$[$}1-7{$]$} versus 5 {$[$}2-12{$]$}) in delirium (95{\%} CI 1.09-6.67, P = 0.0317). The incidence of delirium was significantly less in a small subgroup requiring intraaortic balloon pump and treated with dexmedetomidine (3 of 20 {$[$}15{\%}{$]$} versus 9 of 25 {$[$}36{\%}{$]$}) (relative risk 0.416, 95{\%} CI 0.152-0.637, P = 0.001). Dexmedetomidine-treated patients were more likely to be extubated earlier (relative risk 1.27, 95{\%} CI 1.01-1.60, P = 0.040, log-rank P = 0.036), experienced less systolic hypotension (23{\%} versus 38.1{\%}, P = 0.006), required less norepinephrine (P < 0.001), but had more bradycardia (16.45{\%} versus 6.12{\%}, P = 0.006) than morphine treatment. CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine reduced the duration but not the incidence of delirium after cardiac surgery with effective analgesia/sedation, less hypotension, less vasopressor requirement, and more bradycardia versus morphine regimen.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review will deliberate on contemporary concepts regarding the frailty syndrome and its association with the perioperative period. Frailty syndrome and its relevance to organ systems, scoring tools and intervention measures will be discussed in detail. RECENT FINDINGS: Frail patients have a reduced ability to respond to physical stress, similar to a decreased physiological reserve in the perioperative period. Frailty assessment is gaining popularity as a tool to guide medical interventions in the elderly population. Various measurement tools for preoperative frailty assessment were developed and show promising ability to predict perioperative morbidity, mortality and possibly to guide patient selection and intervention. Preoperative optimization for the frail patient shows mixed results. SUMMARY: Preoperative frailty is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Recently, frailty assessment tools have been developed and show good ability to predict postoperative adverse events. These tools might become a preoperative routine, as they set the ground for patient's selection, guide perioperative interventions for the frail elderly population and thus may influence patient's outcome.},

	abstract = {Perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) is a common complication following thoracic surgery that frequently occurs in patients ≥65 years. PND includes postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) and postoperative delirium (POD). To investigate whether intravenous dexmedetomidine (DEX) is able to improve neurocognitive function in elderly male patients following thoracoscopic lobectomy, a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was performed at the Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical University (Hohhot, China). Patients aged ≥65 years were enrolled and were subjected to thoracic surgery under general anesthesia. A computer-generated randomization sequence was used to randomly assign patients (at a 1:1 ratio) to receive either intravenous DEX (0.5 µg/kg per h, from induction until chest closure) or placebo (intravenous normal saline). The primary endpoint was the result of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The secondary endpoints were the results of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and those obtained with the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), as well as the incidence of POCD and POD during the first 7 postoperative days. Other observational indexes included sleep quality at night, self-anxiety scale prior to the operation and 7 days following the operation and the visual analogue scale (VAS) score at rest and during movement on the first and third day following the operation. Furthermore, at 6 h following surgery, the MMSE score in the DEX group was significantly higher than that in the saline group. At 6 h and on the first day postoperatively, the MoCA score in the DEX group was significantly higher than that in the saline group. The incidence of POCD and POD in the DEX group was 13.2 and 7.5{\%}, respectively, while that in the saline group was 35.8 and 11.3{\%}, respectively. There was a significant difference in the incidence of POCD between the two groups (P<0.01). In the DEX group, mean sleep quality was increased, whereas the mean VAS was decreased compared with the corresponding values in the saline group. In conclusion, elderly male patients who underwent thoracoscopic lobectomy under continuous infusion of DEX (0.5 µg/kg/h) exhibited a reduced incidence of POCD during the first 7 postoperative days as compared with the placebo group. Furthermore, DEX improved the subjective sleep quality in the first postoperative night, reduced anxiety and alleviated postoperative pain. In addition, it increased the incidence of bradycardia. The present study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (www.chictr.org.cn; registration no. ChiCTR-IPR-17010958).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Experimental evidence has indicated the benefits of melatonin (Mel) for the treatment of delirium. Clinical trials had no definite conclusions concerning Mel on delirium after percutaneous transluminal coronary intervention (PCI) in elderly patients. The present study explored whether acute Mel treatment could reduce the incidence of delirium. METHODS: This trial enrolled patients over the age of 60, who were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) after PCI. A computer-generated randomization sequence (in a 1:1 ratio) was used to randomly assign patients to receive Mel (3 mg/day) or placebo once daily for up to 7 days. The primary endpoint was the incidence of delirium, assessed twice daily with the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) during the first 7 postoperative days. Analyses were performed using intention-to-treat and safety populations. RESULTS: A total of 297 patients randomly were assigned to receive either placebo (N = 149) or Mel (N = 148). The incidence of postoperative delirium was significantly lower in the Mel group than in the placebo group (27.0{\%} vs. 39.6{\%}, respectively, P = 0.02). There was no significant difference between 30-day all-cause mortality (12.2{\%} vs. 14.1{\%}, P = 0.62) and drug reactions (0 vs. 2.0{\%}, P = 0.25). The length of stay and hospitalization costs in the Mel group were significantly decreased compared with those in the placebo group (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The current study suggests that Mel is safe and effective in the treatment of delirium after PCI. Further investigation is necessary to fully understand the potential usefulness of Mel in older patients via larger randomized, multicenter, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trials.},

Several clinical studies have shown that oxidative activity under sevoflurane anaesthesia was higher than that under propofol anaesthesia. Therefore, we hypothesised that sevoflurane anaesthesia would discourage SSI compared with propofol anaesthesia. To examine the effect of anaesthesia maintained with sevoflurane and propofol on SSI, a total of 265 consecutive adult patients, with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 1-3, who underwent elective open gastrointestinal surgery under general anaesthesia, were surveyed for SSI between January 2007 and December 2008. Sevoflurane or propofol was selected to maintain anaesthesia in 95 and 170 patients, respectively. A propensity score was used for pairwise matching of these patients to avoid selection biases between the two methods of anaesthesia. Propensity matching yielded 84 pairs of patients. We compared standardised infection ratios (SIRs), i.e. the quotient of the number of SSI cases observed and the number of SSI cases expected, calculated using data from the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance, between sevoflurane and propofol anaesthesia. After propensity matching, SIR after sevoflurane anaesthesia was 1.89 {$[$}95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.46-2.32{$]$}, which was significantly lower than after propofol anaesthesia (4.78; 95{\%} CI: 4.30-5.27) (P=0.02). This study suggests that sevoflurane tends to suppress SSI after elective open gastrointestinal surgery compared with propofol.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delirium is a critical postoperative complication in older patients. Based on the hypothesis that intraoperative dexmedetomidine sedation would lower postoperative delirium than propofol sedation would, the authors compared the incidence of postoperative delirium in older adults, using the mentioned sedatives. METHODS: This double-blinded, randomized controlled study included 748 patients, aged 65 yr or older, who were scheduled for elective lower extremity orthopedic surgery, between June 2017 and October 2021. Patients were randomized equally into two groups in a 1:1 ratio according to the intraoperative sedative used (dexmedetomidine vs. propofol). The postoperative delirium incidence was considered the primary outcome measure; it was determined using the confusion assessment method, on the first three postoperative days. The mean arterial pressure and heart rate were evaluated as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: The authors enrolled 732 patients in the intention-to-treat analyses. The delirium incidence was lower in the dexmedetomidine group than in the propofol group (11 {$[$}3.0{\%}{$]$} vs. 24 {$[$}6.6{\%}{$]$}; odds ratio, 0.42; 95{\%} CI, 0.201 to 0.86; P = 0.036). During sedation, the mean arterial pressure (median {$[$}interquartile range{$]$} mmHg) was higher in the dexmedetomidine group (77 {$[$}71 to 84{$]$}) than in the propofol group (74 {$[$}69 to 79{$]$}; P < 0.001); however, it significantly fell lower (74 {$[$}68 to 80{$]$}) than that of the propofol group (80 {$[$}74 to 87{$]$}) in the postanesthesia care unit (P < 0.001). Lower heart rates (beats/min) were recorded with the use of dexmedetomidine than with propofol, both during sedation (60 {$[$}55 to 66{$]$} vs. 63 {$[$}58 to 70{$]$}) and in the postanesthesia care unit (64 {$[$}58 to 72{$]$} vs. 68 {$[$}62-77{$]$}; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Dexmedetomidine showed a lower incidence of postoperative delirium than propofol in healthy older adults undergoing lower extremity orthopedic surgery.},

	abstract = {The superiority of distinct anesthesia methods for geriatric hip fracture surgery remains unclear. We evaluated high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) with three different anesthesia methods in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. Routine blood test findings, postoperative morbidity, and mortality were assessed as secondary outcome. In total, 176 patients were randomized into desflurane (n = 60), propofol (n = 58), or spinal groups (n = 58) that received desflurane-based balanced anesthesia, propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), or spinal anesthesia, respectively. The spinal group required less intraoperative vasopressors (p < 0.001) and fluids (p = 0.006). No significant differences in HMGB1 (p(group×time) = 0.863) or IL-6 (p(group×time) = 0.575) levels were noted at baseline, postoperative day (POD) 1, or POD2. Hemoglobin, albumin, creatinine, total lymphocyte count, potassium, troponin T, and C-reactive protein were comparable among groups at all time-points. No significant differences in postoperative hospital stay, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and ventilator use among groups were observed. Postoperative pulmonary, cardiac, and neurologic complications; and in-hospital, 30-day, and 90-day mortality were not significantly different among groups (p = 0.974). In conclusion, HMGB1 and IL-6, and all secondary outcomes, were not significantly different between desflurane anesthesia, propofol TIVA, and spinal anesthesia.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since general anaesthesia invariably accompanies surgery, the contribution of each to the development of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) has been difficult to identify. METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled trial was undertaken in elderly patients undergoing extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL). Between 2005 and 2011, 2706 individuals were screened to recruit 100 eligible patients. Patients were randomly assigned to receive general or spinal anaesthesia alone. A battery of eight neuropsychological tests was administered before operation and at 7 days and 3 months after operation. The reliable change index was used to calculate the incidence of POCD. Intention-to-treat analysis was used to compare rates of POCD. RESULTS: Futility analysis led to stopping of the trial after recruitment of 100 patients. Fifty patients were randomly assigned to general anaesthesia, and 48 patients to spinal anaesthesia without sedation or postoperative opioids. At 3 months, POCD was detected in 6.8{\%} {$[$}95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.4-18.7{\%}{$]$} of patients in the general anaesthesia group and 19.6{\%} (95{\%} CI: 9.4-33.9{\%}) in the spinal group (P=0.07). At 7 days after operation, the incidence of POCD was 4.1{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0.5-14{\%}) in the general anaesthesia group and 11.9{\%} (95{\%} CI: 4.0-26.6{\%}) in the spinal group (P=0.16). CONCLUSIONS: We found no significant difference in the rates of POCD when comparing general anaesthesia with spinal anaesthesia, suggesting that the surgical or procedural process itself may contribute to the development of POCD.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common complication in cardiac surgery especially in elderly population which can lead to a delay of weaning from ventilator and extubation. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)-induced inflammation is related to POD. Anti-inflammatory effect of anesthetic agent might attenuate POD. AIMS: The present study was primarily aimed to compare within-24-h POD between ketamine-based anesthesia and propofol-based anesthesia during CPB. The secondary objective was to identify risk factors associated with within-24-h POD. SETTING AND DESIGN: Our study was a randomized controlled trial in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB. Enrolling patients were aged >65 years, and able to comprehensive communication. Exclusion criteria were aortic surgery, cognitive disorders, cerebrovascular and carotid disease, and positive result of preoperative CAM-ICU. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to group Ketamine infusion of 1 mg/kg/h and group Propofol infusion of 1.5-6 mg/kg/h during CPB. POD was evaluated by validated Thai version CAM-ICU at 8-24 hour after ICU arrival. STATISTICS: Chi-square, Fisher exact and t-test tests, univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were utilized. Results: Total 82 patients entered this study and 64 patients remained after exclusion (Group Ketamine = 32 and Group Propofol = 32). Within-24-h POD were 31.25{\%} and 56.25{\%} (P = 0.04) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were 71.45 and 65.53 mmHg (P = 0.01) respectively in Ketamine and Propofol group. Postoperative leukocytosis was a significant risk to POD (adjusted OR 124.5). CONCLUSION: With limitations of the study, prevention of 24-h POD in general by ketamine was inconclusive. In comparison with propofol, ketamine leaded to less events of 24-h POD and kept higher MAP. Severity of postoperative inflammation was a significant prediction of 24-h POD.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of general anesthesia on the risk of incident postoperative delirium in older adults undergoing hip surgery. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of haloperidol prophylaxis for delirium clinical trial data. Predefined risk factors for delirium were assessed prior to surgery. Primary outcome was postoperative delirium. Study outcome was compared across patient groups who received either general or regional anesthesia, and for individuals receiving various perioperative medications (benzodiazepines, anticholinergics, and opioids), using multivariable logistic regression after controlling for potential confounders. Subgroup analyses based on baseline cognitive impairment and delirium risk were also undertaken. SETTING: Large medical school-affiliated general hospital in Alkmaar, the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred twenty-six adults aged 70 and older undergoing hip surgery. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative delirium (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, and Confusion Assessment Method criteria). RESULTS: Sixty participants (11.4{\%}) had incident postoperative delirium. One hundred eighty-nine (35.9{\%}) received general anesthesia, 18 (9.5{\%}) of whom developed postoperative delirium, and 337 (64.1{\%}) received regional anesthesia, 42 (12.5{\%}) of whom developed postoperative delirium (adjusted odds ratio=0.81, 95{\%} confidence interval=0.43-1.52, P=.51). Results were stratified for baseline cognitive impairment, age, acute admission, perioperative medication and other delirium risk factors. Delirium was not independently associated with specific drugs or the medication classes opioids, benzodiazepines, and anticholinergics. CONCLUSION: General anesthesia has no distinct effect on incident postoperative delirium in older adults undergoing hip surgery. This also holds for individuals suffering from cognitive impairment or who are otherwise at risk for postoperative delirium. Perioperative use of narcotics, benzodiazepines, and anticholinergic agents was not associated with incident delirium in this cohort of older adults undergoing hip surgery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We implemented a multidisciplinary pre- and rehabilitation program for elderly patients (≥75 years of age) in a single center consisting of prehabilitation, laparoscopic surgery and early rehabilitation with the intention to lower 1-year overall mortality. METHODS: In this study we compared all patients that underwent elective surgery for stage I-III colorectal cancer before and during development and after implementation of the program (2010-2011, 2012-2013 and 2014-2015). Primary endpoint was 1-year overall mortality, the secondary endpoint was 30-day postoperative outcome. RESULTS: Eighty-six consecutive patients were included in the study cohort and compared to 63 patients from 2010 to 2011 and 75 patients from 2012 to 2013. Patient characteristics were comparable; median age in the study cohort was 80.6. Seventy-three patients (85{\%}) participated in the program, 54 (63{\%}) of whom followed a prehabilitation program, 46 (53{\%}) of whom were discharged to a rehabilitation center. Laparoscopic surgery increased over the years from 70{\%} to 83{\%} in the study cohort. There was a trend in lower 1-year overall mortality: 11{\%} versus 3{\%} (p=0.08). There was a significant reduction in cardiac complications and the number of patients with a prolonged length of stay (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Multidisciplinary care for elderly colorectal cancer patients that includes prehabilitation and rehabilitation is feasible and may contribute to lower complications and reduced length of stay. This study did not show a clear benefit of implementing a comprehensive care program including both prehabilitation and rehabilitation. Dedicated multidisciplinary care seems the key attributer to favorable outcomes of CRC surgery in elderly patients.},

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of postoperative intravenous (IV) acetaminophen (paracetamol) vs placebo combined with IV propofol vs dexmedetomidine on postoperative delirium among older patients undergoing cardiac surgery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, placebo-controlled, factorial clinical trial among 120 patients aged 60 years or older undergoing on-pump coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery or combined CABG/valve surgeries at a US center. Enrollment was September 2015 to April 2018, with follow-up ending in April 2019. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to 1 of 4 groups receiving postoperative analgesia with IV acetaminophen or placebo every 6 hours for 48 hours and postoperative sedation with dexmedetomidine or propofol starting at chest closure and continued for up to 6 hours (acetaminophen and dexmedetomidine: n = 29; placebo and dexmedetomidine: n = 30; acetaminophen and propofol: n = 31; placebo and propofol: n = 30). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was incidence of postoperative in-hospital delirium by the Confusion Assessment Method. Secondary outcomes included delirium duration, cognitive decline, breakthrough analgesia within the first 48 hours, and ICU and hospital length of stay. RESULTS: Among 121 patients randomized (median age, 69 years; 19 women {$[$}15.8{\%}{$]$}), 120 completed the trial. Patients treated with IV acetaminophen had a significant reduction in delirium (10{\%} vs 28{\%} placebo; difference, -18{\%} {$[$}95{\%} CI, -32{\%} to -5{\%}{$]$}; P = .01; HR, 2.8 {$[$}95{\%} CI, 1.1-7.8{$]$}). Patients receiving dexmedetomidine vs propofol had no significant difference in delirium (17{\%} vs 21{\%}; difference, -4{\%} {$[$}95{\%} CI, -18{\%} to 10{\%}{$]$}; P = .54; HR, 0.8 {$[$}95{\%} CI, 0.4-1.9{$]$}). There were significant differences favoring acetaminophen vs placebo for 3 prespecified secondary outcomes: delirium duration (median, 1 vs 2 days; difference, -1 {$[$}95{\%} CI, -2 to 0{$]$}), ICU length of stay (median, 29.5 vs 46.7 hours; difference, -16.7 {$[$}95{\%} CI, -20.3 to -0.8{$]$}), and breakthrough analgesia (median, 322.5 vs 405.3 µg morphine equivalents; difference, -83 {$[$}95{\%} CI, -154 to -14{$]$}). For dexmedetomidine vs propofol, only breakthrough analgesia was significantly different (median, 328.8 vs 397.5 µg; difference, -69 {$[$}95{\%} CI, -155 to -4{$]$}; P = .04). Fourteen patients in both the placebo-dexmedetomidine and acetaminophen-propofol groups (46{\%} and 45{\%}) and 7 in the acetaminophen-dexmedetomidine and placebo-propofol groups (24{\%} and 23{\%}) had hypotension. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among older patients undergoing cardiac surgery, postoperative scheduled IV acetaminophen, combined with IV propofol or dexmedetomidine, reduced in-hospital delirium vs placebo. Additional research, including comparison of IV vs oral acetaminophen and other potentially opioid-sparing analgesics, on the incidence of postoperative delirium is warranted.

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Little is known about the relationship between sedative drugs used preoperatively and postoperative delirium. Melatonin is a drug used to sedate patients preoperatively and is hypothesized by recent works to have a curative effect on postoperative delirium. AIMS: The incidence of postoperative delirium will be tested if affected by three different sedative drugs including melatonin. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Controlled randomized doubleblind study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three-hundred patients aged>65 years scheduled for hip arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia were randomly distributed to one of the four groups. Group 1 (control) received nothing for sedation. Group 2 (melatonin) received 5 mg melatonin. Group 3 (midazolam) received 7.5 mg midazolam. Group 4 (clonidine) received 100 μg clonidine. These medications were given orally at sleep time at night of operation and another dose 90 min before operative time. Patients who developed postoperative delirium received 5 mg of melatonin 9 pm for three successive days in a trial to treat delirium. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Statistical analysis was done using the SPSS Software (version 13). RESULTS: Total of 222 patients completed the study. Percentage of postoperative delirium in the control group was 32.65{\%} (16/49 patients). The melatonin group showed a statistically significant decrease in the percentage of postoperative delirium to 9.43{\%} (5/53 patients). Melatonin was successful in treating 58.06{\%} of patients suffered postoperative delirium (36/62 patients) with no difference between different groups. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative delirium is affected with the drug used for preoperative sedation. Melatonin was successful in decreasing postoperative delirium when used preoperatively and in treating more than half of patients developed postoperative delirium when used for three postoperative nights.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Postoperative delirium is a serious and common complication, it occurs in 13-50{\%} of elderly patients after major surgery, and presages adverse outcomes. Emerging literature suggests that dexmedetomidine sedation in critical care units (intensive care unit) is associated with reduced incidence of delirium. However, few studies have investigated whether postoperative continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine could safely decrease the incidence of delirium in elderly patients admitted to general surgical wards after noncardiac surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in patients aged 65 years or older undergoing major elective noncardiac surgery without a planned ICU stay. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive either dexmedetomidine (0.1 μg/kg/h) or placebo (0.9{\%} normal saline) immediately after surgery though patient-controlled intravenous analgesia device. The primary outcome was the incidence of delirium during the first 5 postoperative days. Secondary outcomes included postoperative subjective pain scores and subjective sleep quality. The study dates were from January 2018 to January 2019. RESULTS: A total of 557 patients were randomly assigned to receive either dexmedetomidine (n=281) or placebo (n=276). The incidence of postoperative delirium had no difference between the dexmedetomidine and placebo groups (11.7{\%} {$[$}33 of 281{$]$} vs 13.8{\%} {$[$}38 of 276{$]$}, P=0.47). Compared with placebo group, patients in dexmedetomidine group reported significant lower numerical rating score pain scores at 3, 12, 24, and 48 hrs after surgery (all P<0.05) and significant improved Richards Campbell Sleep Questionnaire results during the first 3 postoperative days (all P<0.0001). Dexmedetomidine-related adverse events were similar between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Postoperative continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine did not decrease the incidence of postoperative delirium in elderly patients admitted to general surgical wards after elective noncardiac surgery.},

@article{Tan2022,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Remimazolam tosilate (RT) is under evaluation as a sedative for endoscopic procedures. Herein, we aimed to evaluate safety including cognition recovery of RT administered in elderly patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and assess its safety dosage. METHODS: Ninety-nine patients presenting for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were randomized to receive 0.1 mg/kg RT (R1) or 0.2 mg/kg RT (R2), or propofol (P). Cognitive functions (memory, attention, and executive function) were measured via neuropsychological tests conducted before sedation and 5 min after recovery to full alertness. Adverse events were also assessed. RESULTS: There were no statistical differences between postoperative and baseline results for R1 group and P group, whereas those for R2 group revealed worsened postoperative cognitive functions (immediate recall and short delay recall) than baseline (P < 0.05). Compared with P group, Scores demonstrated worse restoration of immediate recall in R1 group, immediate recall, short-delayed recall, and attention function in R2 group (P < 0.05). Patients in R2 group had a longer sedation time (12.09 vs 8.27 vs 8.21 min; P < 0.001) and recovery time (6.85 vs 3.82 vs 4.33 min; P < 0.001) than that in R1 group and P group. Moreover, the incidence of hypotension was 3.0{\%} in R1 group, whereas it was 21.2{\%} in R2 group and 48.5{\%} in P group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The addition of 0.1 mg/kg RT as an adjunct to opiate sedation for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy not only achieves more stable perioperative hemodynamics but also achieves acceptable neuropsychiatric functions in elderly patients.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to investigate the incidence of delirium, wake-up times and early post-operative cognitive decline in one hundred obese elderly patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. DESIGN: Prospective randomized trial. SETTINGS: Operating room, postoperative recovery area, hospital wards. PATIENTS: 100 obese patients (ASA II and III) undergoing primary total knee replacement under general anesthesia with a femoral nerve block catheter. INTERVENTION: Patients were prospectively randomized to maintenance anesthesia with either propofol or desflurane. MEASUREMENTS: The primary endpoint assessed by a blinded investigator was delirium as measured by the Confusion Assessment Method. Secondary endpoints were wake-up times and a battery of six different tests of cognitive function. MAIN RESULTS: Four of the 100 patients that gave informed consent withdrew from the study. Of the remaining 96 patients, 6 patients did not complete full CAM testing. Preoperative pain scores, durations of surgery and anesthesia, and amount of intraoperative fentanyl were not different between groups. One patient in the propofol group developed delirium compared to zero in desflurane. One patient in desflurane group developed a confused state not characterized as delirium. Fifty percent of the patients exhibited a 20{\%} decrease in the results of at least one cognitive test on the first 2days after surgery, with no difference between groups. There were no differences in the time to emergence from anesthesia, incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, and length of postanesthesia care unit (PACU) stay between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion we found a low incidence of delirium but significant cognitive decline in the first 48h after surgery. In this relatively small sample size of a hundred patients there was no difference in the incidence of postoperative delirium, early cognitive outcomes, or wake up times between the desflurane or propofol group.},

	abstract = {AIMS: To determine the effect of choice of inhalational anaesthetic (sevoflurane vs propofol) on the incidence and severity of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in elderly patients (aged >/= 60 years) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: Elderly patients with MCI undergoing radical rectal resection were randomly assigned to receive sevoflurane or propofol general anaesthesia. Cognitive function was assessed using neuropsychological testing before and 7 days after surgery. POCD severity was graded as mild, moderate or severe using standard deviation cut-offs. RESULTS: At 7 days after surgery, the incidence of POCD was 29.7{\%} in the propofol group (n = 101) and 33.3{\%} in the sevoflurane group (n = 99). There was a signi fi cant between-group difference for POCD severity: sevoflurane anaesthesia had a more severe impact on cognitive function than propofol anaesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in the incidence of POCD at 7 days after radical rectal resection under sevoflurane or propofol-based general anaesthesia. Both propofol and sevoflurane were associated with negative cognitive effects, but sevoflurane had a more severe impact on cognitive function than propofol, in elderly patients with MCI.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of dexmedetomidine-assisted intravenous inhalation combined anesthesia on cerebral oxygen metabolism and serum Th1/Th2 levels in elderly patients with colorectal cancer. METHOD: From April 2018 to May 2020,100 elderly patients undergoing elective laparoscopic radical resection of colorectal cancer were prospectively selected and randomly divided into observation group and control group. Before induction of anesthesia, the loading dose of dexmedetomidine was given at 0.5 mug/kg, and the infusion time was 15 min. After tracheal intubation, 0.4 mug/kg/h dexmedetomidine was continuously pumped, and the infusion was stopped 40 min before the end of the operation. In the control group, the same amount of 0.9{\%} sodium chloride was injected intravenously in the same way. 30 min before induction of anesthesia (T0), immediately before induction of anesthesia (T1), immediately after tracheal intubation (T2), 40 min before operation (T3), and immediately after operation (T4), record the blood oxygen content of the artery and internal jugular vein Difference (D(a-jv)O2), brain oxygen uptake rate (COER{\%}), brain oxygen saturation (rSO2) mean. VAS scale, Ramsay scale, MoCA scale were taken at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h postoperatively to evaluate analgesia, sedation, and cognitive function. And monitor the levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin-4 (IL-4), myelin basic protein (MBP), neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and S100beta. The occurrence of restlessness and adverse reactions during the recovery period of the two groups were compared. RESULT: The levels of D(a-jv)O2, COER{\%}, and rSO2 in the control group and observation group were higher than the preoperative basic values at T2, T3, and T4 (P < 0.05); The levels of D(a-jv)O2, COER{\%}, and rSO2 in the observation group were lower than those in the control group at T2, T3, and T4 (P < 0.05). The VAS score and Ramsay score of the observation group were lower than those of the control group at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after surgery, while the MoCA score was higher than that of the control group (P < 0.05). In addition, the serum IFN-gamma, MBP, NSE and S100beta levels of the observation group were lower than those of the control group (P < 0.05), and the ratio of IFN-gamma/IL-4 was higher than that of the control group (P < 0.05). The overall incidence of adverse reactions in the observation group was lower than that in the control group {$[$}32.0{\%} (16/50) vs. 12.0{\%} (6/50), P < 0.05{$]$}. CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine-assisted combined intravenous and inhalation anesthesia is beneficial to reduce perioperative cerebral oxygen metabolism and improve postoperative immunosuppression in elderly patients with colorectal cancer. It has a certain protective effect on nerve injury after operation, thus improving the cognitive function of patients and reducing the occurrence of adverse reactions.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) has shown to benefit older patients undergoing urological and orthopedic surgery. However, this approach has been scarcely assessed in patients elected for colorectal surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort of patients aged >/=70 years admitted for elective colorectal cancer surgery to a single hospital between 2008 and 2012. Upon admission, patients were assigned to a usual care (UC) plan or a CGA-based care (GS) plan conducted by a multidisciplinary team, according to standard clinical criteria.Analyzed outcomes included the incidence of delirium and other geriatric syndromes during hospital stay, mortality, readmissions, andnumber of perioperative complications. RESULTS: The cohort included 310 patients, 203 assigned to the GS group and 107 to the UC group. Patients in the GS group had significantly lower Barthel and Lawton scores, higher prevalence of dementia and heart failure, and higher comorbidity burden. Fifty-four (17.5{\%}) patientsexperienced delirium (23 {$[$}11.3{\%}{$]$} and 31 {$[$}29.2{\%}{$]$} in the GS and UC groups, respectively; p < .001), and 49 (15.8{\%}) patient experienced other geriatric syndromes (21 {$[$}10.3{\%}{$]$} and 28 {$[$}26.2{\%}{$]$} in the GS and UC groups, respectively; p < .001). Serious complications were more frequent in the GS group: 154 (75.9{\%}) vs 60 (56.1{\%}) in the UC group; p < .001. No significant differences were observed between groups regarding readmissions, and in-hospital and post-discharge (1 year follow-up) mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the poorer clinical condition of patients in the GS group, the CGA-based intervention resulted in a lower incidence of delirium and other geriatric syndromes compared with the UC group.},

	abstract = {Objective: To analyze the influence of anesthetic induction of propofol combined with esketamine on perioperative stress and inflammatory responses and postoperative cognition in elderly surgical patients. Methods: A total of 80 elderly surgical patients were randomly divided into a control group (n=40) and a study group (n=40). The control group received anesthetic induction with propofol combined with sufentanil, while the study group received anesthetic induction with propofol combined with esketamine. Hemodynamics, stress and inflammatory responses and changes in cognitive function, perioperative related indexes and adverse responses were compared between the two groups. Results: At T1, the levels of adrenaline, norepinephrine, endothelin, C-reactive protein, white blood cell and procalcitonin in the two groups were not markedly changed compared with those at T0. The levels of the indices at T2and T3were elevated compared with those at T1. However, the levels of the indices at T4were almost close to those at T0, and the levels in the study group were higher than those in the control group. There were statistically significant differences in the comparison of the interaction of the levels of the aforementioned indices between groups, between time points, and between groups and time points (P < 0.05). At 24 h after surgery, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores were decreased in both groups, and the MoCA scores in the study group were higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05). The anesthesia time and consciousness recovery time in the study group were shorter than those in the control group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The anesthetic induction of propofol combined with esketamine, exhibits a good safety profile and reliability, it can improve hemodynamics and surgical stress and inflammatory responses, shorten anesthesia time, promote the recovery of postoperative cognitive function, and cause relatively mild adverse responses.},

@article{Turan2020,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation and delirium are common consequences of cardiac surgery. Dexmedetomidine has unique properties as sedative agent and might reduce the risk of each complication. This study coprimarily aimed to establish whether dexmedetomidine reduces the incidence of new-onset atrial fibrillation and the incidence of delirium. METHODS: A randomised, placebo-controlled trial was done at six academic hospitals in the USA. Patients who had had cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1, stratified by site, to dexmedetomidine or normal saline placebo. Randomisation was computer generated with random permuted block size 2 and 4, and allocation was concealed by a web-based system. Patients, caregivers, and evaluators were all masked to treatment. The study drug was prepared by the pharmacy or an otherwise uninvolved research associate so that investigators and clinicians were fully masked to allocation. Participants were given either dexmedetomidine infusion or saline placebo started before the surgical incision at a rate of 0.1 mug/kg per h then increased to 0.2 mug/kg per h at the end of bypass, and postoperatively increased to 0.4 mug/kg per h, which was maintained until 24 h. The coprimary outcomes were atrial fibrillation and delirium occurring between intensive care unit admission and the earlier of postoperative day 5 or hospital discharge. All analyses were intention-to-treat. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02004613 and is closed. FINDINGS: 798 patients of 3357 screened were enrolled from April 17, 2013, to Dec 6, 2018. The trial was stopped per protocol after the last designated interim analysis. Among 798 patients randomly assigned, 794 were analysed, with 400 assigned to dexmedetomidine and 398 assigned to placebo. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was 121 (30{\%}) in 397 patients given dexmedetomidine and 134 (34{\%}) in 395 patients given placebo, a difference that was not significant: relative risk 0.90 (97.8{\%} CI 0.72, 1.15; p=0.34). The incidence of delirium was non-significantly increased from 12{\%} in patients given placebo to 17{\%} in those given dexmedetomidine: 1.48 (97.8{\%} CI 0.99-2.23). Safety outcomes were clinically important bradycardia (requiring treatment) and hypotension, myocardial infarction, stroke, surgical site infection, pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, and death. 21 (5{\%}) of 394 patients given dexmedetomidine and 8 (2{\%}) of 396 patients given placebo, had a serious adverse event as determined by clinicians. 1 (<1{\%}) of 391 patients given dexmedetomidine and 1 (<1{\%}) of 387 patients given placebo died. INTERPRETATION: Dexmedetomidine infusion, initiated at anaesthetic induction and continued for 24 h, did not decrease postoperative atrial arrhythmias or delirium in patients recovering from cardiac surgery. Dexmedetomidine should not be infused to reduce atrial fibrillation or delirium in patients having cardiac surgery. FUNDING: Hospira Pharmaceuticals.},

@article{Tzimas2018,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hip fracture is common and morbid in elderly patients. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is also very common in these subjects undergoing surgery with an incidence which exceeds 40{\%} in some reports. To date, the evidence is ambiguous as to whether anesthetic technique may affect the patients' outcome as far as postoperative cognitive function is concerned. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the effect of general and subarachnoid (spinal) anesthesia on the development of POCD up to 30 days after surgery in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. Methods Subjects over 65 years with hip fracture undergoing surgery were recruited for this study. They were enrolled and randomized to receive either general anesthesia (GA group) or subarachnoid (spinal) anesthesia (S group). Cognitive function was assessed using a battery of neuropsychological tests undertaken preoperatively and at 30 days postoperatively. The incidence of delirium was examined during the same period and their functional status, in terms of activities of daily living was also recorded. RESULTS: A total of seventy patients, 33 men and 37 females, mean age of 76 years were analyzed. Thirty-three patients received general anesthesia (GA group) and 37 subarachnoid (spinal) anesthesia (S group). The two groups of patients were similar with respect to baseline characteristics, comorbidities and perioperative data. The results of neuropsychological testing showed that there were no significant differences between the groups in eight out of ten neurocognitive tests at baseline and 30 days after surgery. There was a statistically significant decline of the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale score in S group compared with group GA on the 30th postoperative day (p = 0.043). A significant decline was also present in Color-Word Task test in S group compared with group GA at baseline (p = 0.014) and 30 days postoperatively (p = 0.003). Postoperative delirium was present in four patients (12{\%}) for the GA group, and in 10 patients (27{\%}) for the group receiving subarachnoid anesthesia. CONCLUSION: We concluded that the choice of anesthesia modality does not appear to influence the emergence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgery.},

	abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective clinical review and prospective report of postoperative delirium after cervical spine surgeries. OBJECTIVE: To investigate factors contributing to the development of delirium after cervical surgery and see whether amended therapeutic protocols could improve or alter postoperative outcomes. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Important consequences of postoperative delirium for the orthopedic patients include impaired recovery and increased morbidity and mortality. Although its risk factors have been reported in orthopedic surgery, there are a very few reports regarding postoperative delirium in spine surgery. METHODS: Eighty-one cervical myelopathy patients were retrospectively examined about the incidence of postoperative delirium and the risk factors. Similarly, 41 patients who received postoperative care under modified protocols were prospectively examined. RESULTS: Postoperative delirium occurred more commonly in patients over 70 years and those with hearing impairment. Patients who received high-dose methylprednisolone (>1000 mg) demonstrated an increased incidence of postoperative delirium. Under modified protocol, we reduced the usage of methylprednisolone and encouraged free body movement with cervical orthosis immediately after surgery. The incidence of postoperative delirium was significantly lower under the modified protocol. CONCLUSION: Early commencement of mobilization after cervical spine surgery would be crucial to the prevention of postoperative delirium in the elderly.},

	abstract = {Delirium occurs commonly following major non-cardiac and cardiac surgery and is associated with: postoperative mortality; postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction; increased length of hospital stay; and major postoperative complications and morbidity. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of peri-operative administration of dexmedetomidine on the incidence of postoperative delirium in non-cardiac and cardiac surgical patients. In this randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trial we included 63 patients aged ≥60 years undergoing major open abdominal surgery or coronary artery bypass graft surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative delirium, as screened for with the Confusion Assessment Method. Delirium assessment was performed twice daily until postoperative day 5, at the time of discharge from hospital or until postoperative day 14. We found that dexmedetomidine was associated with a reduced incidence of postoperative delirium within the first 5 postoperative days, 43.8{\%} vs. 17.9{\%}, p = 0.038. Severity of delirium, screened with the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist, was comparable in both groups, with a mean maximum score of 1.54 vs. 1.68, p = 0.767. No patients in the dexmedetomidine group died while five (15.6{\%}) patients in the placebo group died, p = 0.029. For patients aged ≥60 years undergoing major cardiac or non-cardiac surgery, we conclude that the peri-operative administration of dexmedetomidine is associated with a lower incidence of postoperative delirium.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether an early multidisciplinary geriatric intervention in elderly patients with hip fracture reduced length of stay, morbidity, and mortality and improved functional evolution. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled intervention trial. SETTING: Orthopedic ward in a university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred nineteen patients aged 65 and older hospitalized for hip fracture surgery. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned to a daily multidisciplinary geriatric intervention (n=155) or usual care (n=164) during hospitalization in the acute phase of hip fracture. MEASUREMENTS: Primary endpoints were in-hospital length of stay and incidence of death or major medical complications. Secondary endpoints were the rate of recovery of previous activities of daily living and ambulation ability at 3, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS: Median length of stay was 16 days in the geriatric intervention group and 18 days in the usual care group (P=.06). Patients assigned to the geriatric intervention showed a lower in-hospital mortality (0.6{\%} vs 5.8{\%}, P=.03) and major medical complications rate (45.2{\%} vs 61.7{\%}, P=.003). After adjustment for confounding variables, geriatric intervention was associated with a 45{\%} lower probability of death or major complications (95{\%} confidence interval=7-68{\%}). More patients in the geriatric intervention group achieved a partial recovery at 3 months (57{\%} vs 44{\%}, P=.03), but there were no differences between the groups at 6 and 12 months. CONCLUSION: Early multidisciplinary daily geriatric care reduces in-hospital mortality and medical complications in elderly patients with hip fracture, but there is not a significant effect on length of hospital stay or long-term functional recovery.},

@article{Vochteloo2011,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delirium in patients with hip fractures lead to higher morbidity and mortality. Prevention in high-risk patients by prescribing low dose haloperidol is currently under investigation. METHODS: This prospective cohort surveillance assessed hip fracture patients for risk of developing a delirium with the Risk Model for Delirium (RD) score. High-risk patients (score ≥5 points) were treated with a prophylactic low-dose of haloperidol according to hospital protocol. Primary outcome was delirium incidence. Secondary outcomes were differences between high- and low-risk patients in delirium, length of stay (LOS), return to pre-fracture living situation and mortality. Logistic regression analysis was performed with age, ASA-classification, known dementia, having a partner, type of fracture, institutional residence and psychotropic drug use as possible confounders. RESULTS: 445 hip fracture patients aged 65 years and older were admitted from January 2008 to December 2009. The RD-score was completed in 378 patients, 173 (45.8{\%}) high-risk patients were treated with prophylactic medication. Sensitivity was 71.6{\%}, specificity 63.8{\%} and the negative predictive value (NPV) of a score < 5 was 85.9{\%}.Delirium incidence (27.0{\%}) was not significantly different compared to 2007 (27.8{\%}) 2006 (23.9{\%}) and 2005 (29.0{\%}) prior to implementation of the RD- protocol.Logistic regression analysis showed that high-risk patients did have a significant higher delirium incidence (42.2{\%} vs. 14.1{\%}, OR 4.1, CI 2.43-7.02). They were more likely to be residing at an alternative living situation after 3 months (62.3{\%} vs. 17.0{\%}, OR 6.57, CI 3.23-13.37) and less likely to be discharged from hospital before 10 days (34.9{\%} vs. 55.9{\%}, OR 1.63, CI 1.03-2.59). Significant independent risk factors for a delirium were a RD-score ≥5 (OR 4.13, CI 2.43-7.02), male gender (OR 1.93, CI 0.99-1.07) and age (OR 1.03, CI 0.99-1.07). CONCLUSIONS: Introducing the delirium prevention protocol did not reduce delirium incidence.The RD-score did identify patients with a high risk to develop a delirium. This high-risk group had a longer LOS and returned to pre-fracture living situation less often.The NPV of a score < 5 was high, as it should be for a screening instrument. Concluding, the RD-score is a useful tool to identify patients with poorer outcome.},

@article{Wang2022,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A clinical study indicated that infusion of dexmedetomidine without a loading dose administered intraoperatively provided a smooth and hemodynamically stable emergence and improved the quality of recovery with fewer postoperative side effects and reduced analgesic requirements. The objective was to determine whether administering remifentanil-propofol combined with dexmedetomidine during general anesthesia would decrease the incidence and severity of postoperative emergence agitation, anxiety, and depression without affecting cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients. METHODS: A total of 120 elderly patients scheduled for ureteroscopic holmium laser lithotripsy were randomly allocated to the PR group and administered normal saline, and the PRD group was administered dexmedetomidine 0.4 mug kg(-1) h(-1) intravenously after the induction of anesthesia and stopped 30 min before the end of surgery. The primary outcome was the Mini-Mental State Examination score. The secondary outcomes were the Richmond Agitation Sedation, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale scores; the memory span for Arabic numerals; the duration of surgery; and the time to spontaneous respiration, recovery, and extubation. RESULTS: The MMSE scores were lower at T1-2 in the two groups (P < 0.001). The dosage of propofol and remifentanil decreased more significantly in the PRD group than in the PR group (P < 0.001). Both the RASS scores and the incidence of emergence agitation (EA) in the PRD group were significantly lower than those in the PR group at t1-3 (P < 0.001). Compared to the PR group, the ZSDS scores and STAI scores at T1-2 were lower in the PRD group (P < 0.005). The number of the Arabic numbers that were accurately recalled from memory was lower at T2 in the PR group than in the PRD group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine administration has no influence on postoperative cognitive dysfunction but could reduce both the dosage of remifentanil and propofol needed during ureteroscopic holmium laser lithotripsy and the incidence and severity of postoperative emergence agitation, anxiety, and depression in elderly patients.

	abstract = {We investigated the effects of ulinastatin on early postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) after one-lung ventilation (OLV) surgery in elderly patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Eighty elderly patients with preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy scheduling for radical esophagectomy under OLV were recruited. They were randomly divided into an ulinastatin pretreatment group (U group, n = 40) and a control group (C group, n = 40). The U group received 10,000 U/kg ulinastatin before anesthesia and 5000 U/kg daily on postoperative days 1 to 3, while C group received saline. Levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, C-reactive protein (CRP), and S-100βprotein were assayed before surgery, at the end of surgery, and on postoperative days 1 and 3. Patients underwent cognitive assessment 1 day before and 7 days after surgery. 38 patients in U group and 37 patients in C group completed the neuropsychological tests. The U group had a lower incidence of POCD than C group (23.7 {\%} versus 45.9 {\%}, P = 0.043). The levels of S-100βprotein, IL-6, IL-10, and CRP in both groups increased after surgery. The postoperative concentrations of S-100βprotein, IL-6, and CRP in U group were lower than those in C group. On postoperative day 3, compared with C group, the level of CRP in U group was lower, while that of IL-10 was higher. These findings demonstrate that ulinastatin can attenuate the elevation of S100βprotein levels and the incidence of POCD, most likely by the mechanism of reducing serum IL-6 and CRP levels and increasing IL-10 levels.},

	abstract = {The aim of the investigation is to clarify the beneficial sedative effects for patients with postoperative intubation in the intensive care unit (ICU) after oral and maxillofacial surgery. Forty patients with postoperative intubation were divided into two groups in method of random number table: midazolam group and dexmedetomidine group. The Ramsay score, the behavioral pain scale (BPS) score, SpO(2), HR, MAP, and RR were recorded before sedation (T0), 30 minutes (T1), 1 hour (T2), 2 hours (T3), 6 hours (T4), and 12 hours (T5) after dexmedetomidine or midazolam initiation in intensive care unit, and 10 minutes after extubation (T6). The rate of incidences of side effects was calculated. Sedation with midazolam was as good as standard sedation with dexmedetomidine in maintaining target sedation level. The BPS score in the midazolam group was higher than that in the dexmedetomidine group. The time of tracheal catheter extraction in the dexmedetomidine group was shorter than that in the midazolam group (p ≤0.001). The incidence of bradycardia in the dexmedetomidine group was higher than that in the midazolam group (p = 0.028). There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of hypotension between the two groups (p = 0.732). The incidence of respiratory depression of group midazolam was higher than that of group dexmedetomidine (p = 0.018). The incidence of delirium in the dexmedetomidine group was significantly lower than that in the midazolam group, and the difference was statistically significant (p = 0.003). Dexmedetomidine and midazolam can meet the needs for sedation in ICU patients. And dexmedetomidine can improve patients' ability to communicate pain compared with midazolam.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium is common among older surgical patients and may be associated with anesthetic management during the perioperative period. The aim of this study is to assess whether intravenous midazolam, a short-acting benzodiazepine used frequently as premedication, increased the incidence of postoperative delirium. METHODS: Analyses of existing data were conducted using a database created from 3 prospective studies in patients aged 65 years or older who underwent elective major noncardiac surgery. Postoperative delirium occurring on the first postoperative day was measured using the confusion assessment method. We assessed the association between the use or nonuse of premedication with midazolam and postoperative delirium using a χ2 test, using propensity scores to match up with 3 midazolam patients for each control patient who did not receive midazolam. RESULTS: A total of 1266 patients were included in this study. Intravenous midazolam was administered as premedication in 909 patients (72{\%}), and 357 patients did not receive midazolam. Those who did and did not receive midazolam significantly differed in age, Charlson comorbidity scores, preoperative cognitive status, preoperative use of benzodiazepines, type of surgery, and year of surgery. Propensity score matching for these variables and American Society of Anesthesiology physical status scores resulted in propensity score-matched samples with 1-3 patients who used midazolam (N = 749) for each patient who did not receive midazolam (N = 357). After propensity score matching, all standardized differences in preoperative patient characteristics ranged from -0.07 to 0.06, indicating good balance on baseline variables between the 2 exposure groups. No association was found between premedication with midazolam and incident delirium on the morning of the first postoperative day in the matched dataset, with odds ratio (95{\%} confidence interval) of 0.91 (0.65-1.29), P = .67. CONCLUSIONS: Premedication using midazolam was not associated with higher incidence of delirium on the first postoperative day in older patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The anesthesia procedure in tumor-type total knee arthroplasty (TKA) may contribute to systemic inflammatory response. Therefore, we aim to investigate the effectiveness and safety of general and spinal anesthesia in patients with tumor-type TKA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients with tumors around the knee undergoing primary unilateral TKA were randomly divided into the general anesthesia group (n = 13) and spinal anesthesia group (n = 12). Knee joint HSS scores and Western Ontario and McMaster University osteoarthritis index (WOMAC osteoarthritis) were recorded before surgery and 12 months after surgery. Visual analogue scale, C-reactive protein (CPR), tumor necrosis factor-α(TNF-α), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) concentration were measured preoperatively (T0), on the day of the operation (T1), and on the first day (T2) after the operation. Complications in the two groups were recorded. RESULTS: The operative time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative drainage, tourniquet time, and complication rate were not significantly different between the general anesthesia and spinal anesthesia groups (all p > 0.05). There were no significant differences in CPR (7.6 $\pm$3.1, 8.1 $\pm$4.1, 91.3 $\pm$24.2 vs. 7.1 $\pm$2.9, 7.6 $\pm$3.8, 85.1 $\pm$19.3 pg/mL, respectively), IL-8 (12.2 $\pm$6.6, 13.4 $\pm$7.3, 19.2 $\pm$10.5 vs. 11.9 $\pm$5.7, 12.9 $\pm$8.6, 22.2 $\pm$12.4 pg/mL, respectively), and TNF-α(2.5 $\pm$1.7, 2.2 $\pm$1.9, 2.8 $\pm$2.1 vs. 2.4 $\pm$1.3, 2.7 $\pm$2.1, 2.9 $\pm$1.6 pg/mL, respectively) between the two groups at T0, T1, and T2 (all p > 0.05). There were no statistical differences in pre- and postoperative HSS knee scores (39.78 $\pm$11.3, 90.24 $\pm$15.3 vs. 42.68 $\pm$12.5, 91.21 $\pm$16.3) and WOMAC indexes (49.89 $\pm$7.9, 25.12 $\pm$6.2 vs. 51.3 $\pm$8.3, 23.15 $\pm$5.3) between the two groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: General anesthesia and spinal anesthesia in patients with tumor-type TKA had the same effectiveness and safety.},

	abstract = {Growing evidence has shown that the elderly population is more susceptible to postoperative cognitive dysfunction/decline (POCD). It has been proven that dexmedetomidine can reduce postoperative cognitive function impairment in elderly patients. Whether dexmedetomidine is better than midazolam in reducing incidence of POCD in elderly surgical patients, however, remains unknown. A total of 198 surgery patients (non-cardiac and non-neurosurgery) were enrolled in the current study. A total of 98 patients (DEX group) received a dose of 0.5 ug/kg dexmedetomidine before the induction of general anesthesia. Another 100 patients (MZ group) received midazolam 0.05 mg/kg. Serum samples of S100βprotein levels were determined immediately before the application of dexmedetomidine or midazolam and 1 hour after surgery. The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) was evaluated at the day before surgery, 5-7 days postoperative, and 3 months postoperative. Results showed that, at 5-7 days after surgery, 52 (26{\%}) patients experienced POCD, with 24 (24.5{\%}) in the DEX group and 28 (28.0{\%}) in the MZ group (24 VS 28, P = 0.575). Three months after surgery, 132 patients accepted the MMSE test, with 16 (12.1{\%}) of them experiencing POCD, including 9 (12.9{\%}) in the DEX group and 7 (11.7{\%}) in the MZ group (9 VS 7, P = 0.783). Increased levels of S100βprotein were higher in the MZ group than DEX group (100.68 $\pm$94.37 pg/mL VS 51.33 $\pm$88.78 pg/mL, P < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that postoperative pneumonia (incidence of postoperative pneumonia in POCD group VS non-POCD group was 0.12 $\pm$0.32 VS 0.08 $\pm$0.28 respectively, P = 0.041), lower preoperative MMSE scores (22.83 $\pm$3.49 VS 25.55 $\pm$3.27, P < 0.001), and increased levels of S100β(134.80 $\pm$81.63 VS 55.40 $\pm$90.41, P < 0.001) were risk factors of POCD occurring within 5-7 days after surgery. Age was included in the risk factors of POCD occurring within 3 months postoperative (71.56 $\pm$4.35 VS 69.22 $\pm$4.29, P = 0.031), except for lower preoperative MMSE scores (24.75 $\pm$3.53 VS 25.94 $\pm$2.96, p = 0.001) and increased levels of S100β(92.08 $\pm$74.12 VS 69.70 $\pm$95.84, P = 0.002). Present results indicate that dexmedetomidine can reduce neuronal injuries but can't reduce incidence of POCD in the elderly, compared with midazolam. Risk factors for POCD occurring at different postoperative periods are different. Age is a potential risk factor of long-term POCD, but not for early POCD in the elderly.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of short-term low-dose intravenous haloperidol for delirium prevention in critically ill elderly patients after noncardiac surgery. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial in two centers. SETTING: Intensive care units of two large tertiary teaching hospitals. PATIENTS: Four hundred fifty-seven patients 65 yrs or older who were admitted to the intensive care unit after noncardiac surgery. INTERVENTION: Haloperidol (0.5 mg intravenous bolus injection followed by continuous infusion at a rate of 0.1 mg/h for 12 hrs; n = 229) or placebo (n = 228) was randomly administered from intensive care unit admission. MEASURES: The primary end point was the incidence of delirium within the first 7 days after surgery. Secondary end points included time to onset of delirium, number of delirium-free days, length of intensive care unit stay, all-cause 28-day mortality, and adverse events. Delirium was assessed using the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit. RESULTS: The incidence of delirium during the first 7 days after surgery was 15.3{\%} (35/229) in the haloperidol group and 23.2{\%} (53/228) in the control group (p = .031). The mean time to onset of delirium and the mean number of delirium-free days were significantly longer (6.2 days {$[$}95{\%} confidence interval 5.9-6.4{$]$} vs. 5.7 days {$[$}95{\%} confidence interval 5.4-6.0{$]$}; p = .021; and 6.8 +/- 0.5 days vs. 6.7 +/- 0.8 days; p = .027, respectively), whereas the median length of intensive care unit stay was significantly shorter (21.3 hrs {$[$}95{\%} confidence interval 20.3-22.2{$]$} vs. 23.0 hrs {$[$}95{\%} confidence interval 20.9-25.1{$]$}; p = .024) in the haloperidol group than in the control group. There was no significant difference with regard to all-cause 28-day mortality between the two groups (0.9{\%} {$[$}2/229{$]$} vs. 2.6{\%} {$[$}6/228{$]$}; p = .175). No drug-related side effects were documented. CONCLUSIONS: For elderly patients admitted to intensive care unit after noncardiac surgery, short-term prophylactic administration of low-dose intravenous haloperidol significantly decreased the incidence of postoperative delirium. The therapy was well-tolerated.},

This study was performed to demonstrate the effects of additional dexmedetomidine (DEX) administration on alleviating early POCD (72 h post intubation) and inflammation in elderly patients who underwent intubation. A parallel-randomized trial was performed in this study. A total of 100 patients aged 60-85 years were randomly divided into two groups (DEX, n = 50; control, n = 50). They received traditional anesthesia and additional DEX medications. Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) were used to assess the cognitive dysfunction of patients. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the stress and inflammatory response of the two groups of patients. Administration of DEX significantly improved the MMSE and MoCA scores 24 and 72 h post operation. The S100βand neuron-specific enolase (NSE) levels in serum were downregulated by DEX 6 and 24 h post operation. The norepinephrine and cortisol levels in serum were downregulated by DEX 15 and 30 min post operation. The interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor α(TNF-α) levels in serum were also downregulated by DEX 15 and 30 min post operation.

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common condition for older adults, contributing to their functional decline. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of the Tailored, Family-Involved Hospital Elder Life Program (t-HELP) for preventing POD and functional decline in older patients after a noncardiac surgical procedure. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A 2-arm, parallel-group, single-blind, cluster randomized clinical trial was conducted from August 24, 2015, to February 28, 2016, on 6 surgical floors (gastric, colorectal, pancreatic, biliary, thoracic, and thyroid) of West China Hospital in Chengdu, China. Eligible participants (n = 281) admitted to each of the 6 surgical floors were randomized into a nursing unit providing t-HELP (intervention group) or a nursing unit providing usual care (control group). All randomized patients were included in the intention-to-treat analyses for the primary outcome of POD incidence. Statistical analysis was performed from April 3, 2016, to December 30, 2017. INTERVENTIONS: In addition to receiving usual care, all participants in the intervention group received the t-HELP protocols, which addressed each patient's risk factor profile. Besides nursing professionals, family members and paid caregivers were involved in the delivery of many of the program interventions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the incidence of POD, evaluated with the Confusion Assessment Method. Secondary outcomes included the pattern of functional and cognitive changes (activities of daily living {$[$}ADLs{$]$}, instrumental activities of daily living {$[$}IADLs{$]$}, Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire {$[$}SPMSQ{$]$}) from hospital admission to 30 days after discharge, and the length of hospital stay (LOS). RESULTS: Of the 475 patients screened for eligibility, 281 (171 {$[$}60.9{\%}{$]$} male, mean {$[$}SD{$]$} age 74.7 {$[$}5.2{$]$} years) were enrolled and randomized to receive t-HELP (n = 152) or usual care (n = 129). Postoperative delirium occurred in 4 participants (2.6{\%}) in the intervention group and in 25 (19.4{\%}) in the control group, with a relative risk of 0.14 (95{\%} CI, 0.05-0.38). The number needed to treat to prevent 1 case of POD was 5.9 (95{\%} CI, 4.2-11.1). Participants in the intervention group compared with the control group showed less decline in physical function (median {$[$}interquartile range{$]$} for ADLs: -5 {$[$}-10 to 0{$]$} vs -20 {$[$}-30 to -10{$]$}; P < .001; for IADLs: -2 {$[$}-2 to 0{$]$} vs -4 {$[$}-4 to -2{$]$}; P < .001) and cognitive function (for the SPMSQ level: 1 {$[$}0.8{\%}{$]$} vs 8 {$[$}7.0{\%}{$]$}; P = .009) at discharge, as well as shorter mean (SD) LOS (12.15 {$[$}3.78{$]$} days vs 16.41 {$[$}4.69{$]$} days; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings suggest that t-HELP, with family involvement at its core, is effective in reducing POD for older patients, maintaining or improving their physical and cognitive functions, and shortening the LOS. The results of this t-HELP trial may improve generalizability and increase the implementation of this program. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry Identifier: ChiCTR-POR-15006944.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To discuss over influence of two different anesthetic and analgesic methods on early cognitive function of elderly patients who received non-cardiac surgery. METHODS: Two hundred and six elderly patients who underwent non-cardiac surgery were selected as research subjects. They were randomly divided into observation group (103 cases) and control group (103 cases). Patients in observation group were given combined spinal and epidural anesthesia and epidural analgesia, while patients in control group adopted general anesthesia and intravenous analgesia. Neurological function test was carried out one day before surgery and on the 7(th) day after surgery. Moreover, changes of postoperative pain degree, neuropsychological function and cognitive function were observed and compared. RESULTS: On the 7(th) day after surgery, incidence of cognition impairment in observation group and control group was 48.50{\%} (50/103 cases) and 44.70{\%} (46/103 cases), and difference between groups had no statistical significance. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Score of observation group was much lower than control group in the 12(th), 24(th) and 48(th) h after surgery (p < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis suggested that, short education years and general surgery were independent risk factors for early cognition impairment. CONCLUSION: About 46.60{\%} elderly patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery developed cognition impairment, but influence of different anesthetic and analgesic methods on incidence of postoperative cognition impairment of elderly patients had no significant difference.},

	abstract = {Effect of dexmedetomidine on the cognitive function of patients undergoing gastric cancer surgery by regulating the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway was investigated. A total of 110 patients who were diagnosed and underwent radical gastrectomy in Ruijin Hospital North, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine from July 2016 to July 2018 were selected. In the experimental group, 60 patients were treated with dexmedetomidine infusion. In the control group, 50 patients were injected with 0.9{\%} sodium chloride injection during the same period. The expression levels of serum inflammatory factors tumor necrosis factor-α(TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), PI3K and AKT of patients were compared between the two groups before and after surgery for 1 day. The number of adverse reactions in the two groups was compared. The correlation between mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score and the expression levels of serum IL-6, PI3K and AKT was compared. The levels of serum TNF-α, IL-6, PI3K and AKT after operation for 1 day of patients in the two groups were significantly higher than those before operation (P<0.05), and were lower in the experimental than in the control group (P<0.05). The number of postoperative cognitive dysfunction of patients in the experimental group was lower than that of patients in the control group (P<0.05). The total number of adverse reactions in the control group was higher than that of patients in the experimental group (P<0.05). The MMSE scores of the two groups were decreased at 1 day after operation and were significantly lower in the control group than in the experimental group (P<0.05). The MMSE score was negatively correlated with the expression levels of serum TNF-α, IL-6, PI3K and AKT (P<0.001). Dexmedetomidine can effectively reduce the expression levels of postoperative inflammatory factors in patients undergoing gastric cancer surgery, improve the postoperative cognitive function by regulating PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and promotes the recovery of postoperative cognitive function.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common complication in patients with hip fractures and is associated with an increased risk of subsequent dementia. The aim of this trial was to evaluate the effect of a pre- and postoperative orthogeriatric service on the prevention of delirium and longer-term cognitive decline. METHODS: This was a single-center, prospective, randomized controlled trial in which patients with hip fracture were randomized to treatment in an acute geriatric ward or standard orthopedic ward. Inclusion and randomization took place in the Emergency Department at Oslo University hospital. The key intervention in the acute geriatric ward was Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment including daily interdisciplinary meetings. Primary outcome was cognitive function four months after surgery measured using a composite outcome incorporating the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) and the 10 words learning and recalls tasks from the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease battery (CERAD). Secondary outcomes were pre- and postoperative delirium, delirium severity and duration, mortality and mobility (measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)). Patients were assessed four and twelve months after surgery by evaluators blind to allocation. RESULTS: A total of 329 patients were included. There was no significant difference in cognitive function four months after surgery between patients treated in the acute geriatric and the orthopedic wards (mean 54.7 versus 52.9, 95{\%} confidence interval for the difference -5.9 to 9.5; P = 0.65). There was also no significant difference in delirium rates (49{\%} versus 53{\%}, P = 0.51) or four month mortality (17{\%} versus 15{\%}, P = 0.50) between the intervention and the control group. In a pre-planned sub-group analysis, participants living in their own home at baseline who were randomized to orthogeriatric care had better mobility four months after surgery compared with patients randomized to the orthopedic ward, measured with SPPB (median 6 versus 4, 95{\%} confidence interval for the median difference 0 to 2; P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Pre- and postoperative orthogeriatric care given in an acute geriatric ward was not effective in reducing delirium or long-term cognitive impairment in patients with hip fracture. The intervention had, however, a positive effect on mobility in patients not admitted from nursing homes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01009268 Registered November 5, 2009.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine the effect of a more-efficient home care protocol to manage total joint replacement (TJR) patients after surgery. DESIGN: A randomized trial of two home care protocols for TJR management. SETTING: A hospital-affiliated home healthcare agency in a large midwestern city. PARTICIPANTS: Medicare-eligible individuals undergoing elective total hip or knee replacement surgery (N = 136). INTERVENTION: A home care protocol that included preoperative home visits by a nurse and a physical therapist and fewer postoperative visits (range of 9-12 visits) to the home than an existing protocol (range of 11-47 visits). MEASUREMENTS: Functional status, lower extremity functioning, health-related quality of life, satisfaction with care, and use and cost of healthcare services for 6 months postsurgery. RESULTS: There were no differences in functional status, health-related quality of life, or lower extremity functioning by group at 6 months. A marginally significant gain in satisfaction with access to care (P =.059) was found in the intervention group at 6 months. Home healthcare costs were 55{\%} lower for the streamlined group (P <.001). Other costs did not differ significantly by group. CONCLUSION: TJR patients who received the more-efficient home care protocol experienced comparable outcomes to those who received the existing protocol. An abbreviated set of home care visits resulted in more-efficient delivery of care without compromising patient outcomes.},

@article{Weber2009,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare the influence of either general (GA) or local (LA) anesthesia on the postoperative neurocognitive outcome in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in a randomized study. Therefore, we performed a subgroup analysis of the multicenter GALA study. METHODS: A total of 40 patients were enrolled and randomized to receive either LA (n = 17) or GA (n = 23) anesthesia. The indication for intraoperative shunting was based on the intraoperative cognitive performance in the LA group and on the clinical experience of the surgeon in the GA group. Outcome measurements included patient performance on a neuropsychological Trail Making Test, evaluation of patients mood using the self-report inventory BSKE, and serum levels of the neurobiochemical marker S100beta. The data were analyzed for each variable using a t-test and were presented as the mean (SD). Differences in shunt frequency were analyzed performing a chi-squared test. Group differences in the Trail Making Test, BSKE evaluation, and S100beta concentrations were derived from the analyses of covariances with repeated measurements using preoperative values as covariates. RESULTS: Compared to baseline, the S100beta concentrations increased significantly in the GA group {$[$}0.086 (0.038) vs. 0.061 (0.024) microg/l; p < 0.001{$]$} before unclamping of the carotid artery, whereas there were no changes in the LA group {$[$}0.068 (0.024) microg/l, p = 0.09 vs. 0.061 (0.021) microg/l, p = 0.09). Furthermore, we detected significant group differences after surgical intervention (GA 0.087 (0.031) microg/l; LA 0.06 (0.021) microg/l; p = 0.006). The postoperative neurocognitive performance in the Trail Making Test decreased significantly in the GA group, whereas there were no significant changes in the LA group. The self-report inventory BSKE evaluation revealed no significant group differences. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that performing local anesthesia in patients undergoing CEA positively influenced early postoperative neurocognitive outcomes. Significant group differences in postoperative S100beta concentrations confirmed the beneficial effect of local anesthesia.},

@article{Whitlock2015,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiopulmonary bypass initiates a systemic inflammatory response syndrome that is associated with postoperative morbidity and mortality. Steroids suppress inflammatory responses and might improve outcomes in patients at high risk of morbidity and mortality undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. We aimed to assess the effects of steroids in patients at high risk of morbidity and mortality undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. METHODS: The Steroids In caRdiac Surgery (SIRS) study is a double-blind, randomised, controlled trial. We used a central computerised phone or interactive web system to randomly assign (1:1) patients at high risk of morbidity and mortality from 80 hospital or cardiac surgery centres in 18 countries undergoing cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass to receive either methylprednisolone (250 mg at anaesthetic induction and 250 mg at initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass) or placebo. Patients were assigned with block randomisation with random block sizes of 2, 4, or 6 and stratified by centre. Patients aged 18 years or older were eligible if they had a European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation of at least 6. Patients were excluded if they were taking or expected to receive systemic steroids in the immediate postoperative period or had a history of bacterial or fungal infection in the preceding 30 days. Patients, caregivers, and those assessing outcomes were masked to allocation. The primary outcomes were 30-day mortality and a composite of death and major morbidity (ie, myocardial injury, stroke, renal failure, or respiratory failure) within 30 days, both analysed by intention to treat. Safety outcomes were also analysed by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00427388. FINDINGS: Patients were recruited between June 21, 2007, and Dec 19, 2013. Complete 30-day data was available for all 7507 patients randomly assigned to methylprednisolone (n=3755) and to placebo (n=3752). Methylprednisolone, compared with placebo, did not reduce the risk of death at 30 days (154 {$[$}4{\%}{$]$} vs 177 {$[$}5{\%}{$]$} patients; relative risk {$[$}RR{$]$} 0.87, 95{\%} CI 0.70-1.07, p=0.19) or the risk of death or major morbidity (909 {$[$}24{\%}{$]$} vs 885 {$[$}24{\%}{$]$}; RR 1.03, 95{\%} CI 0.95-1.11, p=0.52). The most common safety outcomes in the methylprednisolone and placebo group were infection (465 {$[$}12{\%}{$]$} vs 493 {$[$}13{\%}{$]$}), surgical site infection (151 {$[$}4{\%}{$]$} vs 151 {$[$}4{\%}{$]$}), and delirium (295 {$[$}8{\%}{$]$} vs 289 {$[$}8{\%}{$]$}). INTERPRETATION: Methylprednisolone did not have a significant effect on mortality or major morbidity after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. The SIRS trial does not support the routine use of methylprednisolone for patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. FUNDING: Canadian Institutes of Health Research.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: No consensus has yet been reached regarding the best anesthetic technique for inguinal hernia repair. This study aimed to compare postoperative clinical outcomes and inflammatory markers among patients who were anesthetized using local, spinal, or general anesthesia for inguinal hernia repair. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial included patients scheduled to undergo elective unilateral inguinal hernioplasty at Siriraj Hospital during November 2014 to September 2015 study period. Patients were randomly assigned to the local (LA), spinal (SA), or general (GA) anesthesia groups. Primary outcomes were postoperative pain at rest and on mobilization at 8 and 24 hours after surgery. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients were included, with 18 patients randomly assigned to each group. Patient demographic and clinical characteristics were similar among groups. There were no significant differences among groups for postoperative pain at rest or on mobilization at 8 and 24 hours after surgery. No significant differences were observed for interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and interleukin-10 at any time points in any groups. Patients with local anesthesia was associated with less time spent in anesthesia (p = 0.010) and surgery (p = 0.009), lower intraoperative cost (p = 0.003) and total cost in hospital (p = 0.036); however, patient satisfaction in the local anesthesia group (94/100) was statistically significantly lower than the spinal and general anesthesia groups (100/100) (p = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: No statistically significant difference was observed among groups for postoperative pain scores, duration of hospital stays, complications, or change in inflammatory markers. However, time spent in anesthesia and surgery, the intraoperative cost and total cost for hernia repair, and patient satisfaction were significantly lower in the local anesthesia group than in the other two groups.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to examine the effect of dexmedetomidine for intraoperative sedation and postoperative cognitive function in patients with preoperative anxiety undergoing carotid artery stenting. METHODS: Eighty patients were randomly divided into two groups: the dexmedetomidine group and the control group. Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Anxiety was evaluated using the Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale. Routine monitoring indices were recorded during surgery, and cognitive function indices were recorded before drug infusion (T0), 10 minutes after drug infusion (T1), at the end of surgery (T2), and 6 hours after surgery (T3). RESULTS: The anxiety scores were not significantly different between the two groups at T0, but they became significantly different at T1-3. The MMSE scores in both groups increased at 1 and 7 days postoperatively; although the increase in the dexmedetomidine group was sharper, there was no significant difference. In both groups, the MMSE scores at 1 and 7 days after surgery were not significantly different from those at 1 day before surgery. CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine can improve patients' anxiety and achieve a sufficient sedation effect without causing postoperative cognitive dysfunction.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preoperative administration of methylprednisolone reduced circulating markers of endothelial activation. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was to evaluate whether a single preoperative dose of methylprednisolone reduced the rate of postoperative delirium (POD) in older patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery and its association with the shedding of endothelial glycocalyx markers. METHODS: About 168 patients, aged 65-80 years and scheduled for laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery, were randomized to 2 mg/kg methylprednisolone (Group M, n = 84) or equivalent dose of placebo (Group C, n = 84). The primary outcome was the incidence of delirium during the first 5 days after surgery, assessed by the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). POD severity was rated daily using CAM-Severity (CAM-S). Levels of syndecan-1, heparan sulfate, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were measured at baseline, 1 day, and 3 days after surgery. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, methylprednisolone greatly reduced the incidence of delirium at 72 hours following surgery (9 {$[$}10.7{\%}{$]$} vs 20 {$[$}23.8{\%}{$]$}, p = .03, OR = 2.22 {$[$}95{\%} CI 1.05-4.59{$]$}). No between-group difference was found in the cumulative CAM-S score (p = .14). The levels of heparan sulfate, syndecan-1, and TNF-alpha in Group M were lower than that in Group C (p < .05 and p < .01), while the level of BDNF in Group M was higher than that in Group C (p < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative administration of methylprednisolone does not reduce the severity of POD, but may reduce the incidence of delirium after gastrointestinal surgery in older patients, which may be related to a reduction in circulating markers of endothelial degradation, followed by the increase of BDNF level.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Delirium is the most common postoperative neurological complication and some evidence suggests that dexmedetomidine is associated with a decreased incidence of delirium. This study is designed to assess the effect of dexmedetomidine on postoperative delirium (POD) in elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: Sixty geriatric patients with MCI were enrolled and ramdomly divided into two groups by a computer-generated randomisation sequence: dexmedetomidine group (D group) and normal saline group (C group). Patients in D group received a loading dose of 0.5 μg/kg dexmedetomidine over 10 minutes before anesthesia induction, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.4 μg·kg(-1)·h(-1) until 30 minutes before the end of surgery; equal volume of normal saline was given in C group. Blood samples were extracted to detect the concentration of cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α(TNF-α), interleukin-10 (IL-10), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) before anesthesia induction (T(1)), before suture (T(2)), and 30 minutes after surgery (T(3)). Postoperative recovery times were recorded. Delirium was assessed with the 3-Minute Diagnostic Interview for confusion assessment method during the first 7 days postoperatively. RESULTS: POD occurred in 10 (33.3{\%}) of 30 patients in C group, and in 3 (10{\%}) of 30 patients given dexmedetomidine (odds ratio {$[$}OR{$]$} 0.222, 95{\%} CI 0.054-0.914; P = 0.028). The serum concentrations of TNF-α, MMP-9, and GFAP were significantly increased and IL-10 was decreased in the C group than in the D group at T(2) and T(3). No differences were observed between groups in the level of HO-1. Analysis using random-effect multivariable logistic regression indicated that POD was associated with GFAP (odds ratio {$[$}OR{$]$} 16.691, 95{\%} CI 2.288-121.746; P = 0.005). The positive predictive ability of the multivariate logistic regression model tested by ROC analysis showed an area under the curve of 0.713 (95{\%} CI, 0.584-0.842). CONCLUSIONS: Dexmedetomidine can alleviate POD in elderly patients with MCI and may be related to reduce the neuroinflammation by lowering the permeability of blood-brain barrier.},

	abstract = {Background: To evaluate the effects of dexmedetomidine on the incidence of postoperative delirium (POD) and plasma S-100βprotein levels in elderly patients undergoing hip surgery. Methods: A total of 110 elderly patients who underwent hip surgery were enrolled in this study and grouped using the random number table method. The study group (55 patients) received 0.5 μg/kg dexmedetomidine before anesthesia induction and the control group (55 patients) received an equal dose of 0.9{\%} sodium chloride injection before anesthesia induction. Results: Compared with the control group, the study group had lower fentanyl and propofol consumption, shorter time to waking up, shorter time to respiratory recovery, shorter extubation time, and lower incidence of POD (p < 0.05).Mean arterial pressure, oxygen saturation, and heart rate at T1 and T2 were lower than those at T0 in the control group as well as lower than those in the study group at the same time point (p < 0.05). Both groups showed higher S-100βlevels at T1, T2, and T3 compared with those at T0 (p < 0.05); however, the levels were lower in the study group than in the control group at the abovementioned time points (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Dexmedetomidine could decrease the consumption of anesthetic drugs, shorten postoperative recovery time, stabilize hemodynamics, decrease adverse reactions caused by anesthesia, and decrease the incidence of POD, which may be achieved by improving cerebral metabolism, regulating serum S-100βlevels.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intravertebral and general anesthesia (GA) are two main anesthesia approaches but both have defects. This study was aimed to evaluate the effect of subarachnoid anesthesia combined with propofol target-controlled infusion (TCI) on blood loss and transfusion for total hip arthroplasty (THA) in elderly patients in comparison with combined spinal-epidural anesthesia (CSEA) or GA. METHODS: Totally, 240 patients (aged ≥65 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists {$[$}ASA{$]$} I-III) scheduled for posterior THA were enrolled from September 1st, 2017 to March 1st, 2018. All cases were randomly divided into three groups to receive CSEA (group C, n = 80), GA (group G, n = 80), or subarachnoid anesthesia and propofol TCI (group T, n = 80), respectively. Primary outcomes measured were intra-operative blood loss, autologous and allogeneic blood transfusion, mean arterial pressure at different time points, length of stay in post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), length of hospital stay, and patient satisfaction degree. Furthermore, post-operative pain scores and complications were also observed. The difference of quantitative index between groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, repeated measurement generalized linear model, Student-Newman-Keuls test or rank-sum test, while ratio index was analyzed by Chi-square test or Fisher exact test. RESULTS: Basic characteristics were comparable among the three groups. Intra-operative blood loss in group T (331.53 $\pm$64.33 mL) and group G (308.03 $\pm$64.90 mL) were significantly less than group C (455.40 $\pm$120.48 mL, F = 65.80, P < 0.001). Similarly, the autologous transfusion of group T (130.99 $\pm$30.36 mL) and group G (124.09 $\pm$24.34 mL) were also markedly less than group C (178.31 $\pm$48.68 mL, F = 52.99, P < 0.001). The allogenetic blood transfusion of group C (0 {$[$}0, 100.00{$]$}) was also significantly larger than group T (0) and group G (0) (Z = 2.47, P = 0.047). Except for the baseline, there were significant differences in mean arterial blood pressures before operation (F = 496.84, P < 0.001), 10-min after the beginning of operation (F = 351.43, P < 0.001), 30-min after the beginning of operation (F = 559.89, P < 0.001), 50-min after the beginning of operation (F = 374.74, P < 0.001), and at the end of operation (F = 26.14, P < 0.001) among the three groups. Length of stay in PACU of group T (9.41 $\pm$1.19 min) was comparable with group C (8.83 $\pm$1.26 min), and both were significantly shorter than group G (16.55 $\pm$3.10 min, F = 352.50, P < 0.001). There were no significant differences among the three groups in terms of length of hospitalization and post-operative visual analog scale scores. Patient satisfaction degree of group T (77/80) was significantly higher than group C (66/80, χ= 7.96, P = 0.004) and G (69/80, χ= 5.01, P = 0.025). One patient complained of post-dural puncture headache and two complained of low back pain in group C, while none in group T. Incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting in group G (10/80) was significantly higher than group T (3/80, χ= 4.10, P = 0.043) and group C (2/80, χ= 5.76, P = 0.016). No deep vein thrombosis or delayed post-operative functional exercise was detected. CONCLUSIONS: Single subarachnoid anesthesia combined with propofol TCI seems to perform better than CSEA and GA for posterior THA in elderly patients, with less blood loss and peri-operative transfusion, higher patient satisfaction degree and fewer complications.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hepatectomy is a highly invasive procedure with a high probability of postoperative delirium. Treatment with antiulcer drugs is indispensable after hepatectomy for anastomotic ulcer management. The clinical pathway for hepatectomy was reviewed and the antiulcer drug used was switched from famotidine, a H2-receptor antagonist, to omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, owing to the pharmacist's intervention. METHODS: Hepatectomized recipients over 65 years of age, except in the cases of laparoscopic surgery and intensive care unit entry, were treated with famotidine injections (10 patients) or omeprazole injections (11 patients), and the incidence rates and severity of delirium were compared between the famotidine and omeprazole groups. The delirium after hepatectomy was assessed using the Japanese version of the NEECHAM confusion scale. RESULTS: The incidence rates of delirium were 90{\%} in the famotidine group and 27.3{\%} in the omeprazole group. Four out of 9 recipients in the famotidine group were injected with haloperidol to treat for delirium, but no recipients needed this treatment in the omeprazole group. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with famotidine, the use of omeprazole was found to be effective in reducing the incidence rate and severity of postoperative delirium in patients undergoing hepatectomy. Pharmacists should actively strive to mitigate the risks of delirium.},

Methods: Atotal of 100 patients, 42 male and 58 female, ages 60 to 85 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade I or II, who were undergoing total hip arthroplasty were randomly divided into 2 groups: A dexmedetomidine group (group D; n = 50) and a control group (group C; n=50). Group D patients were infused with 0.3 lg kg1 h1 of dexmedetomidine from 5 minutes prior to anesthesia induction until the end of surgery. Group C patients received an equal volume of saline. Heart rate and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were recorded before anesthesia induction (T0), 1 minute before extubation (T1), and 30 minutes after extubation (T2). The Visual Analog Score (VAS) at 1, 2, and 3 days after surgery, the incidence and duration of postoperative delirium, and the length of hospital stay were recorded. Adverse reactions, such as nausea, vomiting, and lethargy, were also recorded. Results: The Visual Analog Scores in the 2 groups were similar. In group D, there was no significant difference in heart rate (P = 0.232) and MAP (P = 0.056) between T0 and T1. However, in group C, heart rate significantly increased by 15.3 bpm (P = 0.000) and MAP significantly increased by 10.7 mmHg (P = 0.001) at T1 compared with those at T0. The incidence of postoperative delirium in group D (10{\%}) was significantly lower than that in group C (26{\%}; P=0.037). The duration of delirium in group D (1.3 6 0.6 days) was shorter than that in group C (3.0 6 0.5 days; P=0.000). The length of hospital stay in group D (13.2 6 0.9 days) was shorter than that in group C (16.1 6 0.7 days; P = 0.000). No significant differences were observed in adverse effects between the 2 groups. Conclusion: Intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine can not only reduce the incidence and duration of postoperative delirium, but also shorten the length of hospital stay in elderly patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty. {\copyright}2021 International College of Surgeons.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Postoperative delirium incidences are increasing in older adults. A Cochrane Review found no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative delirium between total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and inhalational anesthesia (IA). This study evaluated the differences in postoperative delirium and morbidity between patients who underwent either TIVA or IA. METHODS: A nationwide Japanese inpatient database was used to retrospectively compare differences in postoperative delirium and composite morbidity between patients older than 65 years, who underwent general anesthesia (TIVA or IA). The primary outcome was postoperative delirium. The secondary outcomes were: morbidity incidence, length of hospital stay, and mortality. A 1:3 propensity score analysis of patients who underwent all surgical procedures was conducted according to covariates, to calculate odds ratios and their 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs). Sensitivity analyses were conducted using an instrumental variable analysis of the proportion of TIVA by hospital scale, stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting analyses, limiting the definitions of postoperative delirium, and subgroup analysis. RESULTS: Of 738,600 patients, 149,540 received TIVA and 589,060 received IA. After 1:3 propensity score matching, the adjusted odds ratios for postoperative delirium and composite morbidity were 0.93 (95{\%} CI 0.91-0.95) and 0.94 (95{\%} CI 0.90-0.97), respectively, for TIVA concerning IA. There were no differences in the length of the intensive care unit and hospital stay, or hospital mortality. The findings were consistent with the sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that TIVA was related to a slightly decreased postoperative delirium and incidence of morbidity compared to IA.},

	abstract = {Objective: This study compared the post-anesthesia delirium in elderly patients treated with Dexmedetomidine and Midazolam Maleate after thoracic surgery. Methods: A total of 92 elderly patients treated with thoracic surgery in our hospital from June to September 2015 were selected. Digital random method was used to equally divide them into group A (n=46) and group B (n=46). Both groups were given with a continuous intravenous pumping of fentanyl for analgesia. Dexmedetomidine for group A and Midazolam Maleate for group B, and the delirium occurrence rates of patients in the two groups after the surgery were compared. Results: Awaking time 4.92 $\pm$1.18 min, breathing recovery time 10.53 $\pm$2.25 min, and extubation time 11.36 $\pm$2.63 min of patients in group A were significantly shorter than those in group B (P<0.05). Postoperative delirium occurrence rate of 6.52{\%} in group A was significantly lower than that in the control group, and the difference between the two groups had statistical significance (P<0.05). Difference between two groups before surgery in Mini-Mental State Evaluation (MMSE) scores was not significant without statistical significance (P>0.05). The MMSE scores 27.01 $\pm$0.46, 27.22 $\pm$0.50, 27.73 $\pm$0.54 and 28.62 $\pm$0.63 of patients in group A and 6 h and 1, 2 and 3 d after the surgery were significantly higher than those in the control group, and comparative difference between the two groups had statistical significance (P<0.05). In comparison between group A and group B in visual analog scale scores at time nodes before induction, after intubation, and upon surgery completion, the difference did not have statistical significance (P>0.05). Conclusion: Dexmedetomidine can improve the postoperative cognitive functions of elderly patients treated with thoracic surgery and reduce postoperative delirium.},

@article{Zangrillo2011,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Volatile anesthetics reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and mortality in coronary artery surgery. Recently, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines suggested the use of volatile anesthetic agents for the maintenance of general anesthesia during noncardiac surgery in patients at risk for perioperative myocardial ischemia, but no randomized experience to document the cardioprotective effects of these agents exists in this setting. Therefore, the authors performed a prospective, randomized, controlled trial to compare the effects of sevoflurane versus total intravenous anesthesia, in terms of postoperative cardiac troponin I release in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. DESIGN: A randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: A teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-eight consecutive patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were allocated randomly to receive either volatile anesthetic (44 patients) as the main anesthetic agent or total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) (44 patients). MEASUREMENTS: Postoperative cardiac troponin I release was measured as a marker of myocardial necrosis. Patients with detectable postoperative troponin I in the sevoflurane group (12/44, 27.3{\%}) were similar to those in the propofol group (9/44, 20.5{\%}; p = 0.6). There was no significant reduction of postoperative median peak cTnI release (0.16 $\pm$0.71 ng/mL in the sevoflurane group compared with the TIVA group, 0.03 $\pm$0.08 ng/mL; p = 0.4). Three patients died at the 1-year follow-up for noncardiac causes (2 in the TIVA group). CONCLUSIONS: In the authors' experience, patients undergoing noncardiac surgery did not benefit from anesthesia based on halogenated anesthetics. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the cardioprotective effects of volatile agents in noncardiac surgery.},

@article{Zhang2018,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sevoflurane anesthesia is a high-risk factor for postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in elderly patients. Recently, some studies demonstrated that dexmedetomidine (DEX) could reduce the incidence of POCD caused by sevoflurane anesthesia. We hypothesized that DEX could reduce the incidence of POCD caused by sevoflurane anesthesia through decreasing plasma interleukin (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-αconcentrations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 120 patients aged 65-75 years scheduled for esophageal carcinoma resection were randomly assigned to four groups. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were used to measure patients' cognitive function the day before operation and the 1(st), 3(rd), and 7(th) postoperative days. The plasma TNF-α, IL-6, and S100 βprotein concentrations were measured by ELISA 10 min before anesthesia administration and the 1(st), 3(rd), and 7(th) postoperative days. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the demographic or clinical characteristics or perioperative hemodynamic status in all groups. Compared with Group M + P, the MMSE and MoCA scores were significantly lower and the plasma TNF-α, IL-6, and S100 βprotein concentrations were significantly higher in Group M + S at the 1(st), 3(rd), and 7(th) postoperative days (P < 0.05). Compared with Group M + S, the MMSE and MoCA scores were significantly higher and the plasma TNF-α, IL-6, and S100 βprotein concentrations were significantly lower in Group D + S at the 1(st), 3(rd), and 7(th) postoperative days (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The POCD incidence was higher in elderly patients receiving sevoflurane anesthesia and DEX could alleviate POCD in these patients through decreasing plasma TNF-αand IL-6 concentrations.},

@article{Zhang2018,
	abstract = {Background: Studies have shown that perioperative inflammatory response is one of the important factors that caused postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Ulinastatin is a broad-spectrum protease inhibitor that inhibits inflammatory. We investigated the effects of ulinastatin on inflammatory response and early postoperative cognitive function in elderly patients undergoing spinal surgery. Methods: This clinical trial was approved by the Xuanwu Hospital Ethical Committee (Registration number: ChiCTR-IPR-16008931). Sixty elderly patients undergoing elective spinal surgery with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) status of I-II were randomized into ulinastatin and control groups; total intravenous anesthesia was performed. The elderly patients in ulinastatin group underwent intravenous infusion of ulinastatin 10,000 units/kg following anesthesia induction and before surgical incision, and 5000 units/kg on post-operative days 1 and 2. Cognitive function was determined with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) test preoperatively and on post-operative day 7 by a neurologist. Serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) concentration levels were measured at baseline, the end of surgery, and on post-operative days 1 and 3. Results: All elderly patients completed the study. Ulinastatin infusion significantly reduced the incidence of POCD in elderly patients undergoing spine surgery (ulinastatin group 16{\%} vs. control group 43{\%}, Χ2 = 5.079, P = 0.024, P < 0.05). The elderly patients in ulinastatin group exhibited lower serum LPS, IL-6, CRP, and MMP-9 concentrations, as well as a shortened peak value duration, compared with those in the control group following surgery (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Systemic inflammation and translocation of LPS were inhibited by the infusion of ulinastatin in elderly patients undergoing spinal surgery. The anti-inflammation intervention with ulinastatin can significantly improve the elderly patients' postoperative cognitive function.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The results of postoperative delirium (POD) warrant testing for prevention. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a nursing intervention targeting risk factors could decrease the incidence of POD among patients who had coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in China. METHODS: A prospective before-after study was conducted between April 2014 and April 2015. A nursing delirium intervention protocol targeting risk factors for delirium was performed for 141 patients undergoing CABG in a cardiothoracic ICU from November 2014 to April 2015. Intervention consisted of screening for delirium risk factors, followed by targeted risk factor modification, including pain control, early catheter removal, patient orientation using the 5W1H procedure, increased family visits, minimizing care-related interruptions, comfortable nursing and monitoring for sleeping difficulties. Outcomes of the Intervention Group were compared with those of the Control Group for 137 CABG patients from April 2014 to October 2014. Delirium was assessed using the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU). The sample size was justified by PASS2000, based on previous data of delirium incidence in our institution (30{\%}). MAIN RESULTS: Delirium incidence during the first seven postoperative days was significantly lower in the Intervention Group at 13.48{\%} (19/141) vs. 29.93{\%} (41/137) for the Control Group (chi2 = 11.112, P = 0.001). In addition, POD in the Intervention Group occurred between the 3rd and 6th postoperative days, while POD in the Control Group mainly occurred on the first three days postoperatively. Delirium in the Intervention Group occurred later than delirium in the Control Group (chi2 = 12.743, P < 0.001). Length of ICU stay was reduced significantly (Z = -6.026, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The application of a nursing protocol targeting risk factors in this study seems to be associated with a lower incidence of POD in patients after CABG. This finding suggests that managing the predictors properly is one of the effective strategies to prevent delirium.},

This study investigated the effects of dexmedetomidine on POD and pro-inflammatory markers in elderly patients with hip fracture. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, controlled trial enrolled patients ≥65 years of age who underwent an operation for hip fracture at Beijing JiShuiTan Hospital from October 2016 to January 2017. The patients were divided into the DEX group (injected with dexmedetomidine 0.5 µg/kg/h) and the NS group (injected with normal saline). After surgery, the incidence of delirium at postoperative day 1 (T1), 2 (T2), and 3 (T3) was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method delirium scale. Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-αblood levels were detected at T0 (before surgery), T1, and T3. RESULTS: Data from 240 patients were analyzed, with 120/group (intent-to-treat analysis). Dexmedetomidine decreased POD incidence (18.2 vs. 30.6{\%}, P = 0.033). Compared to T0, all three pro-inflammatory markers were higher at T1 and then decreased at T3 (time interaction, all P < 0.001). IL-6 (P < 0.001) levels were lower in the DEX group at T1, and TNF-α(P = 0.003) levels were lower in the DEX group at T1 and T3, but IL-1βlevels were similar between the two groups. The rate of adverse events was similar in the two groups. CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine reduced the incidence of POD in elderly patients on the first day after hip fracture surgery, and reduced IL-6 and TNF-αlevels over the first 3 days after surgery.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impacts of general and spinal anesthesia on short-term cognitive function and mental status in elderly patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery. STUDY DESIGN: An experimental study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Anesthetics, the Central People's Hospital of Tengzhou City, Shandong Province, China, from December 2016 to December 2017. METHODOLOGY: A total of 80 elderly patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery were selected and randomly divided into the observation group and the control group, 40 cases in each group. The observation group underwent spinal anesthesia, and the control group underwent general anaesthesia. Eye opening time, language presentation time etc.in the two groups were compared. RESULTS: The eye opening time and language presentation time in observation group were all lower than those in control group (both p<0.001). At 1, 3 and 6 hours after surgery, the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores and the amplitudes of the P300 wave of observation group were all higher than those of the control group (all p<0.001), the latencies of the P300 wave in observation group were all lower than control group (all p<0.001). At 24h after surgery, the number of cases suffering postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in the observation group was lower than that of the control group (p=0.039). CONCLUSION: Compared with general anaesthesia, spinal anesthesia can effectively shorten the eye opening time and language presentation time in elderly patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery. It also has few impacts on the short-term cognitive function and mental status of such patients, with lower incidence of POCD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The choice of general anaesthetics may affect postoperative cognitive outcomes. This study was designed to compare the potential impact of propofol-based vs sevoflurane-based general anaesthesia on the development of delayed neurocognitive recovery in older adults early after major cancer surgery. METHODS: Older adults (aged ≥65 and <90 yr) who were scheduled to undergo major cancer surgery (≥2 h) were randomised to receive either propofol- or sevoflurane-based general anaesthesia. Cognitive function was assessed before and 1 week after surgery with a battery of neuropsychological tests. Age- and education-matched non-surgical controls were recruited, and their cognitive functions were tested at comparable time intervals in order to adjust for learning effects from repeated tests. Delayed neurocognitive recovery was diagnosed according to the International Study of Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction 1 definition. RESULTS: From April 1, 2015 to October 15, 2016, 392 patients were enrolled and randomised. Of these patients, 387 completed the intervention and 30-day follow-up, and 379 completed 1-week neuropsychological tests. Fifty-nine control subjects were enrolled and completed repeated neuropsychological tests. The incidence of delayed neurocognitive recovery at 1 week was significantly lower in the propofol group {$[$}14.8{\%} (28/189){$]$} than in the sevoflurane group {$[$}23.2{\%} (44/190); odds ratio=0.577; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.342-0.975; P=0.038{$]$}. Safety outcomes did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: When compared with sevoflurane-based general anaesthesia, propofol-based general anaesthesia might decrease the incidence of delayed neurocognitive recovery in older adults after major cancer surgery.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of dexmedetomidine intervention on serum inflammatory factor concentration and postoperative cognitive malfunction in elderly patients with general anesthesia. Methodology. 174 patients with general anesthesia were selected, who were categorized into a control group (HC) and a dexmedetomidine group (HS) using the random number table method, with 87 patients in individual groups. The dexmedetomidine group was pumped intravenously with dexmedetomidine at a loading dose of 1 μg/kg before induction of anesthesia for 15 min, followed by continuous intravenous pumping at a rate of 0.4 μg/kg/h, and the dosing was stopped at 30 min before concluding the surgery. The control group was administered the identical dose of saline in the same manner. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor α(TNF-α) levels and MMES scores were tested at 1 h before and 24 h after anesthesia. RESULTS: Comparing to HC group, patients in the HS group had lower TNF-αand IL-6 levels at both scheduled points (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine reduced the expression of inflammatory factors in elderly patients with general anesthesia and effectively reduced the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction after general anesthesia surgery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) are common complications after major surgery among elderly patients. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is less frequently explored for its effects in patients with postoperative neurocognitive disorders. This study investigated the effect and optimal dosage of DEX for patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) on POD and early POCD after major surgery among elderly patients. METHODS: Patients in four groups received continuous infusion of DEX 0, 100, 200, and 400 μg with sufentanil 150 μg for PCA immediately after surgery. POD and POCD were assessed on postoperative days 1, 2, 3, and 7 by using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scales. Furthermore, the incidence of POD and POCD of all the four groups in postoperative 7 days classified by high risk factors (age, education, surgical site, and surgical category), sedation level, postoperative pain intensity, and side effects were assessed. RESULTS: The overall incidence rates of POD and early POCD 7 days after surgery were lower in the DEX 200 μg 400 μg groups than in the DEX 0 μg and 100 μg groups (P < 0.05). Compared with DEX 200 μg, DEX 400 μg reduced early POCD in patients who underwent open surgery (P < 0.05). There were no intergroup differences in the postoperative sedation level, pain intensity, and side effects. CONCLUSION: The continuous infusion of DEX 200 μg or DEX 400 μg in PCA significantly decreased the incidence of POD and early POCD after major surgery without increasing any side effects. Compared with DEX 200 μg, DEX 400 μg was preferred for reducing early POCD in patients who underwent open surgery.},

@article{Zhou2019,
	abstract = {Background: Recent studies have shown that early diagnosis and intervention promote the patient's good prognosis. For patients who underwent cardiac surgery and require extracorporeal circulation support, the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is higher than in other types of surgery due to greater changes in brain perfusion compared with normal physiological conditions. Recent studies have confirmed that the use of ulinastatin or dexmedetomidine in the perioperative period effectively reduces the incidence of POCD. In this study, ulinastatin was combined with dexmedetomidine to assess whether the combination of the two drugs could reduce the incidence of POCD. Methods: One hundred and eighty patients with heart valve replacement surgery undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass from August 2017 to December 2018 were enrolled, with age 60--80 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grades I--III, education level above elementary school, and either gender. According to the random number table method, patients were grouped into ulinastatin + dexmedetomidine (U+D) group, ulinastatin (U) group, dexmedetomidine (D) group, and normal saline (N) control group. Group U was pumped 20,000 UI/kg immediately after induction and the first day after surgery, group D continued to pump 0.4 μg/kg/h from induction to 2 h before extubation, group U+D dexmedetomidine 0.4 μg/kg/h + ulinastatin 20,000 UI/kg, and group N equal volume of physiological saline. The patients were enrolled with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) before surgery. The cognitive function was assessed by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) on the first day before surgery and on the seventh day after surgery. Inflammatory factors, such as S100βprotein, interleukin (IL)-6, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, were detected in peripheral blood before anesthesia (T0), immediately after surgery (T1), and immediately after extubation (T2). Results: One hundred and fifty-four patients enrolled in this study. Compared with group N, the incidence of POCD in group U+D was the lowest (P < 0.05), followed by group U and group D. Group U+D had the lowest concentration of inflammatory factors at the T1 and T2 time points, followed by group U and group D. Conclusions: Both ulinastatin and dexmedetomidine can reduce the perioperative inflammatory response and the incidence of POCD in patients with heart valve surgery, and their combination can better reduce the incidence of POCD.},

Elderly patients undergoing replacement of total hip were randomly divided into three groups of equal size (n=60). A control group (control) received no treatment before or at the end of surgery. The other two groups, PRE and INTRA, received 50 mg flurbiprofen intravenously 15 min before the surgery and 30 min before the end of surgery, respectively. The pain score was evaluated by a visual analog scale (VAS) at the following time-points: 24 h before surgery (T0), and 3 h (T1), 12 h (T2) and 24 h (T3) after surgery. Peripheral venous blood was collected at T0, T1, T2 and T3. Cognitive function was assessed by mini-mental state examination (MMSE) at the time of T0, T1, T2 and T3. The serum concentration of tumor necrosis factor α(TNF-α), interleukin-1β(IL-1β), IL-6, and Cox-2 were measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The VAS scores and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the PRE and INTRA groups were less than those in the control group at T1, T2 and T3. The MMSE scores in PRE and INTRA groups were significantly higher than those in the control group at T1, T2 and T3. The PRE group showed a lower VAS score, release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and higher MMSE scores at T1, T2 and T3 than the control and INTRA groups. Intravenous flurbiprofen administration reduces postoperative pain and flammatory response after hip arthroplasty. Moreover, flurbiprofen is more effective when given preoperatively than intraoperatively.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective is to observe the effect of Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) in the perioperative period of hip fracture. METHODS: From October 2018 to October 2021, 155 patients over the age of 65 diagnosed with hip fracture and treated with surgery at the Department of Trauma Orthopaedics of General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University were randomly divided into two groups using a prospective research method. A total of 70 cases in the CGA group received a perioperative comprehensive assessment of the geriatric, and 85 cases in the control group received routine medical consultation. RESULTS: Elderly patients with hip fractures have a high comorbidity index. Patients with abnormal daily activity before injury accounted for 55{\%}, the abnormal rate of nutrition was 58.1{\%}, the abnormal rate of cognition, anxiety, and depression was 81.8{\%}, and 77.3{\%} of the patients were in a weak state. There was no significant difference in age, gender, ASA grade, fracture type, and operation mode between the two groups, but there were significant differences in operation rate at 48 h (χ(2) = 22.153; P ≤0.001), preoperative waiting time (Z = -6.387; P ≤0.001), total hospital stay (Z = -11.756; P ≤0.001), and incidence of postoperative delirium (χ(2) = 23.897; P ≤0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of CGA shortened the preoperative waiting time and total hospital stay, increased the 48 h operation rate, and reduced the incidence of postoperative delirium.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of dexmedetomidine combined with epidural anesthesia on cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in elderly patients after orthopedic surgery. METHODS: A total of 187 elderly patients who needed orthopedic surgery in our hospital from January 2019 to December 2020 were randomly divided into an experimental group (n=95) and a control group (n=92). The patients in the experimental group were administered 1 mug/kg dexmedetomidine hydrochloride injections, and the patients in the control group were administered 0.9{\%} sodium chloride injections, which were infused using a micropump for about 10 minutes. The two groups' cognitive function, VAS scores, and vital signs were compared. RESULTS: There were significant differences in the two groups' mean arterial pressures and heart rates at intubation time (T3), operation start time (T4), and extubation time (T6) (P < 0.05). The VAS scores in the experimental group were significantly different from the VAS scores in the control group at 24 hours after the operations, 48 hours after the operations, 72 hours after the operations, and 7 days after the operations (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in the anesthesia times, the average bleeding volumes, or the average operative durations (P > 0.05). 48 hours after the operations, the MMSE score in the experimental group was (27.15+/-1.17), which was significantly different than the MMSE score in the control group (23.11+/-0.83), and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Epidural anesthesia combined with dexmedetomidine has little circulatory interference in elderly patients; moreover, it can reduce the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients.},

@article{Zhu2018,
	abstract = {Objective: Inflammation plays a key role in the etiology and pathology of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor celecoxib is used for the treatment of acute pain due to its potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. Herein, we evaluated the effects of celecoxib on POCD in geriatric patients. Methods: A total of 178 geriatric patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty were randomly divided into two groups and treated with celecoxib (group C) or placebo (group P). The levels of perioperative plasma COX-2, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, neuron-specific enolase, and S100βwere detected in all patients. The pain intensity was measured by numerical rating scale (NRS). A battery of 9 neuropsychological tests was performed pre-operatively and 1 week, and 3 months postoperatively. Patients, whose postoperative performance declined by ≧1 standard deviation as compared to each preoperative test score on ≧2 tests, were classified as POCD. Results: A significant decrease in POCD incidence was found in group C as compared to group P on postoperative day 7 (12.3{\%} vs. 34.1{\%}; p < 0.05). POCD incidence did not differ between the two groups at the 3-month follow-up (8.8 vs. 9.7{\%}). NRS scores at days 3 and 4 post-surgery were significantly lower in group C (p < 0.05). Patients in group C showed lower level of plasma COX-2, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and S100βas compared to group P postoperatively (p < 0.05). Conclusion: These results demonstrated that celecoxib can decrease early POCD incidence after total knee arthroplasty in geriatric patients, which might be mediated by suppressing inflammation and acute postoperative pain caused by surgical trauma.
